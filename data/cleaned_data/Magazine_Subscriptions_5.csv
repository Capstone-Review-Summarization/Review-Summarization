7,7,3,False,"03 15, 2006",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7PS,Bryan Carey,"Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.  Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the ""departments"". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being ""Know- Tell"" and the ""The Details""). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.  As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.  I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads ""Is Your Wife a Bad Mom""? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.  The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.  Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the ""Anthropology"" page at the end. This closing ""article"" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what ""Anthropology"" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question ""Gay or ______"". For example, I have seen titles like ""Gay or Best Friends?"", ""Gay or Cowboy?"", ""Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?"", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.  Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.  Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.",Give Me the Details,1142380800,98.0,,,internet product go husband risky focus arrow understand headline round cover edge subtitle shallow topic cigarette study edgy rocker namely many disappointment buying different contains age quote range read read star electronics substance picture department business tell far recent yes lifestyles cowboy mildly quickly undertake magazine besides mom explicit vodka would bad sample mother late young writer girlfriend blunt sound main penalty set overall two meant immature devote comment dress call eye year analysis example do every small know give liquor name person clothe anthropology exception like could sixty cologne four offend amaze question toward apart car group nothing claim several diverse engage problem envelope unique raise intellectual friend see one conclusion death page new broad point diagram trendiest gear help certain reader raw various married etc group see discussion flip bottom fashion story big vary asks bother need fragrance old though featured humorous diversity always three recommendation close hurt fresher fail offer generally simply interest half write think expensive others next lots income upper tell seem take act bodily neo middle purchasing find interesting little thing tear silly aim deal similar good consider set single scent politics talk tempt whether attribute common mostly language part discover front kid make one's catching capture word interest best often article look well difference pop insult month title push find ask way feeling fluff percent men depend thanks smell age deserve high gay great multiple magazine accuse wife handle line appeal letter food break change issue article drink perspective necessarily tell otherwise male advertisement page incompetent item coat sort even headline matter lead else basically aspects short like instead penchant cover punk content end substitute make detail people past decide show anything keep feature
8,8,4,False,"09 24, 2007",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7P0,Bryan Carey,"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.  When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.  One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.  Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.",Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment,1190592000,2.0,,,know aim product extremes nice stellar like go read much find prefers component lose freak way section interest maximum electronic fine usually adults product question young job strip get nature pulse many thing guide pc seem take queue make contrast different device rank instructional direction technology learn magazine age less middle quantity electronics little thing relish technical one depth offer replace part new issue quality memory answer computer bring remainder primary repair inter-workings educational session circuit good accomplish worth talk offer respond boring depth printer time improve wiring reader common part buy literally still short inside root concern analyze subject numerous make forefront large review word like best wisdom overall pretty often article instead life cause available overly get personal rather

It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time. There are numerous articles on remodeling, ""Foolproof Potted Plants"", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden. The best article of all, is ""The Magic of Soup"", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead.

The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Men's Health"" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?  I had been meaning to pick up an issue of ""Men's Health Magazine"" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.  ""Men's Health Magazine,"" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today ""Men's Health Magazine"" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.  The problem with ""Men's Health"" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.  And yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?  I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of ""Men's Health"" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?

But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH.  It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs.  To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS.  In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, well, there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you.

Ok, I do cook a lot, but my hubby is gluten free so a lot of the recipes are unusable, or need modification.  Like all other ""home"" mags it's very consumer-driven. Buy this new cleaner/foundation/moisturizer. Buy these new rugs/lamps/sofas. Buy these backpacks/storage cubes/clothes that are trending now for your kids. Buy, buy, buy. I find this very off-putting. Even  the ""budget"" room remodels (furniture replacement) usually have ridiculously priced rugs, lamps, or chairs that I can't ever imagine buying.  There are articles on handling family, financial, and social issues, party planning, etc as you would expect. It is very current, with discussions of sex (though not as frank as Redbook is), social media, and other issues.  Bottom line, if you are a modern mom with some disposable income trying to ""do it all and look fabulous"" this is probably right for you.

Some other reviewers have raised some valid points concerning article length, and bias toward upscale properties. I think that there are other magazines that might be more suitable for others, including 'Budget Travel' and 'National Geographic Traveler', both of which I also subscribe to and enjoy, though they both have their limitations and issues as well. So what sets 'Conde Nast' apart? I think it is the willingness to find new and exciting vacation destinations that are still reasonable enough to get to as to make them worthwhile to a large audience. Some of the more exotic magazines have great articles on hiking in Tibet and the like, but how many people are really able to do that (or can afford to do it?) My point is that although it is by no means perfect, I think the editors and writers do consciously strike a balance between the too mundane and too exotic (and expensive) and attempt to focus the majority of the magazine in that area. This is just too good of a magazine to pass up. The 'Deals of the Month' section alone justifies the price.

131,131,4,False,"12 23, 2011",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7T3,Bryan Carey,"Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.  Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.  Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.  Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.  Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.  Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.",Texas Monthly Keeps You Up to Speed with the Lone Star State,1324598400,,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,timeless nice happening prepare read reveune much excessive find amount star factor longer open enjoy way event like positive order hundred offer diminish event true news handy cover section travel amusement generally could interest know need street usually try approach culture resident generate create next least enjoyable get important nothing point several reach length many diverse thing journey smart change something great thirty take state advice magazine date long read find music middle tad fun food thing write place tool department one page offer mark medium new issue title back table lesser account popular remainder help festival reason soon yes material go manual home good city town type quick publication large offer list number pleasant learn display magazine advertisement focus reader page would present call item issue town etc content fifty usage visit practically still area even reference inside glimpse include book art fashion story majority texan lone current consist texas continue short edit special style best present outsider art article along eighteen department look typical keep take din call throughout featured return people thousand quarter monthly well individual base example relate another three final every remove start anything ad number keep small

It's for people who travel for business, where a corporation is paying, and for those who can afford to travel luxuriously for pleasure, at least occasionally.  I love reading about exotic destinations, the top spas and bath experiences in the world, and amazing travel experiences.  It has gorgeous photography, interesting articles, and solid information.  Even if I can't afford to take trips like this every year, I still want to read about them.  If I'm going to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip I'll want to know just where to say and what to do.  When I went to Florida I stayed in budget places except for the last night, when we went to the Hotel Fontainebleau on Miami Beach, which was wonderful.  It's important to know and decide when to save money and when it's worth it to splurge.  I almost gave my subscription up because with physical disabilities it's unlikely I can do a lot of travel.

Baer,"At the risk of inverting priorities, let me begin this review with a word of disclosure about the reviewer:  I love travel, am on the road half the time for professional reasons, travel to all the continents, have lived on three of them for extended periods of time, and nurture a quiet reservation about people who 'get to know' faraway places by the convenience of a short visit to an affluent resort.  However, I have also seen both the good that tourism has done for local economies and the blinkered understanding of the world too often suffered by those who cannot or choose not to travel. So my reluctance should not be construed as resentment.  OK, enough of that. Given these caveats about high-end travel, Cond Nast can be a fascinating read. Some of it ('Escape from the Airport. Passenger power saves the day', Dec 2006) is valuable for air travelers on almost any budget.  Yet the *real* value of this magazine will be mined by those whose circumstances allow them to travel anywhere they want. For that kind of affluent tourist, Cond Nast can be a gold mine of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.  In my judgement, TRAVEL AND LEISURE beats CONDE NAST TRAVELER by a nose in this sector's competition, but either one will do you. If you had, say, five years of high-end travel in front of you, you'd do well to toss in some coins for subscriptions to both.

It almost seems as if they used a very budget template to create the article layout. Also the feel of what they are covering seems so spare that even catalogs seem more ""homey"" than the homes they featured. Struck me as odd that *all* the homes they featured seemed like the set designer was only about 60% done with dressing the shoot. Looked like someone was just moving in and had not finished adding those touches that make it special. Just my opinion....

Martin,"Bottom-line: While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  The New Year brought a new commitment to fitness; Yeah!  But no, this time I'm serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading ""US Weekly Magazine,"" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.  I am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but ""US Weekly"" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, ""US Weekly"" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  ""US Weekly"", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.  There are no articles in ""US Weekly"", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  ""US Weekly"" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood's Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a ""Winner!"" while poor Jessica was ""Scary!"" after her sojourn under the knife.  Regular sections in the magazine include:  o Hot Hollywood o Hot Pics o Features o News o Style o In Every Issue  But lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although ""US Weekly"" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) ""guy"" territory.  Conclusion  While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  And while I have to admit that (women) celebrities intrigue me, I would rather not read a whole magazine devoted to their every step; ""US Weekly"" is not for me.",This Magazine Must Keep the Paparazzi (All of Them) Employed,1292284800,,,,know treadmill shed paragraph beside plastic female woman read intrigue hollywood's admit prevent amount yeah star bring genre advertising newly surgery pic territory cloth load knee scary news copious straight shallow fine usually world think fitness breakup hot young title normally least book unfocused journalism get caption enquirer statement photo hound poor enough barely seem diet national ripe february serious pound veneer call magazine write-up well long although read unlike line tad star little substance picture shed course aniston conclusion depth page celebrity lot new issue imply article guy right lighten whole minutia sexy regular pretend rather single simpson self machine bottom-line occasion hollywood knife lack revenge court step aguilera want periodical full thin advertisement--mostly listening time magazine unwanted hate headline sidebar attempt advertisement would reese publish therein fair entertainment issue reputable editorial weekly jessica attention indeed masthead even include fast make-up fashion celebrity winner exclusion tedious commitment make advertiser design short i'm pas style audience--almost word devote basis two continual section contain article along meanwhile mean abundance instead cover life mainstream gym content witherspoon sojourn feature slim pound christina people well year undemanding say example base every anything colorful give jennifer picture feature

My main problem with it is that everytime I pick up an issue, I feel like I'm stalking these celebs.

My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet.

Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.  What makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.  Unlike other computer related magazines they write about trends, and outstanding products.  This leaves them more room for good reporting and less veiled advertising.  They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.  I have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.

318,318,3,False,"11 15, 2006",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7TL,Bryan Carey,"Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.  Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.  What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.  Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.  The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.  Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.",Wired for the Modern World,1163548800,5.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,aim internet shuffle nice weird scatter like month read additional find iraq jump head author exceed third way like subscriber topic perspective ever hip recommend recall event space pace generally could near reputation uneven nerd world topic core culture next war angle normally problem tech high several favorite length modern many diverse enough marketing change unique different scratch mean technology wonder television layout camera magazine find read interesting leave pda's little electronics see percentage dedicates write departments one fact frequently part business new issue change rank article place computer whole popular separate occupy savvy clearer exception definition good politics caters large together first digital minute certain magazine result page reader common would present entertainment blend sometimes concern also still wire late form audience discussion associate writer include mix kept fact subject current make around overall best two section often article total department magazine's cover include keep seem communicate end make featured political monthly another every regular semi keep editor feature

Wired has always had a forward-looking, sophisticated attitude toward technology.  You can tell that every article is well-researched and no feature in the magazine is an afterthought.  In every issue, you will find: - stories about the unsung heroes who are really responsible for pushing the limits of technology - some politically-oriented article that shows the growing interplay between technology and politics - cool digital and electronic gadgets (that usually cost a lot of $$) - fun stuff like Jargon watch, Wired vs. Tired, and even some of the ads (how often can you say that?) Beyond that, I find Wired is the best place to read about things like the melding of human and computer and the progess of technology outside of the U.S.  So, I find every issue interesting.  It's a little less useful to me as an investor in technology stocks, but it does offer me that broader perspective on technology that helps put investable ideas into context.  The clincher is the price - a small sacrifice for so much intriguing and entertaining content.

In fact, Seventeen has all of these and much more! From recipes to inspiring life stories, from sex to cool celebrity photos, Seventeen is packed with informative and entertaining articles, plus, lots of cool colorful photographs. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations list of the 100 best selling magazines in the United States, Seventeen is ranked 25th, but none of the ones above Seventeen on the list are directed at teens and young women, thus, making Seventeen the best selling magazine for young readers. It has over 2,000,000 readers to date, and that number is growing. But, not only is Seventeen a best seller, it's also one of the most sought after collectibles in the world! At auctions, I've seen editions from the 70's and 80's sell for as much as [money]each, depending on things such as condition, who was on the cover, etc. And I've noticed that editions of Seventeen do not have to be very old to bring a good price. I've seen editions as little as 2 years old sell for upwards of [money] each. I fell in love with the magazine when I was 17. I was in class when I noticed one of my classmates reading a copy. As I peered over her shoulder, I seen in the magazine one of the most beautiful girls in the world. Turned out, the model would later turn into one of the hottest actresses in film----Phoebe Cates. So I asked my classmate where I could get a copy and she told me I could find them in most any store or get them by subscription. So because of Phoebe Cates, I started collecting the magazine just for her lovely pics. Later, stars such as Brooke Shields,and Jennifer Connelly kept me buying the magazine. Then I began to read the articles and found them both interesting and informative. I can say with assurance that some of the articles in Seventeen have helped keep me looking younger and healthier. So while Seveteen is directed mainly at young women between the ages of 12 and 20, guys can also benefit from some of its contents.

Martin,"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.  I have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.  All of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.  Regular sections in the magazine include:  o Features: feature length articles; o Megapixels o What's New o Headlines o How 2.0 o FYI o Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.  My favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.  Other articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:  o Protect Everything; the future of personal security. o Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator o It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge o Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes  The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.  The coal is used in the process and the Carbon it creates as a by-product is pumped underground into a saline solution.  The item was short, but came away from it with a thorough understanding of a process I had heretofore never heard of.  I have only one minor quibble with the magazine: almost one third of the back half of the monthly is given over to adverting.  Not the expensive glossy, glamorous kind, but the shady little, not so sure you can thrust what their advertising kind found is too many other wise respectable magazines.  Subscriptions  Popular Science Magazine is published by Time 4 Media. In addition to the English language edition, Popular Science is also published in China, Israel, Korea and Mexico. Book shelf sells for a cover price of $3.99 US, Canada $4.99, while a 12-month subscription will set you back $15.95 and a 24-month subscription checks in at 21.95. If you are doing the math--and you should--that's a 77% saving off the single copy price. You might be able to find a better deal at one of the on-line magazine subscription sites like Magazines.com, or e-Subscription.com.  Conclusion  Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending Popular Science to anyone who asks.

Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their  restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information.  I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of  tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and  jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake.  The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each.  I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States.  The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, ""The Pantry"", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine.

As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.  Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.  The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.  Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.","Improve Your Knowledge, with Popular Science",1260489600,5.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,knowledge application simplistic nice in-depth guide read gain chemical elementary like science say however space level generally could electronic fine might write count scientific title everyone least tech twenty high modern many certainly device different rank mean technology learn magazine well huge intellectual word little advanced thing percentage department one page physic scope new issue tell possible popular sense yes material educational go curious good environmental limited mass publication large perfectly out couple first beginner's want remember learn scientifically intend mind reader improve would background top etc also vehicle prove short late attention dedicate include fact else year subject majority idea span choice short need atoms present two work article without cover evident seem soak make featured trend every may use understand keep clear intelligent dedicate

In an effort to attract more readers, GQ has spiced up some of its articles with more sex and it is common to find a scantily clad female on the cover- a place that used to be reserved exclusively for men. This isn't to say that the articles have suffered greatly from the changeover. There are still several good articles in each issue of GQ, combined with a few too many articles about relationships.  When GQ is at its best is when the magazine is talking politics, entertainment, and/or culture. I have read many interesting political articles in GQ, ranging from topics like homeland security to men's rights when it comes to abortion. The entertainment articles are also quite good and the GQ team can be counted on to deliver some good, frank discussion about movies, books, movies, Hollywood celebrities, etc.  GQ used to seem a little more fashion oriented than it is today. There are still several fashion related articles in each issue but the difference is that the GQ of today contains articles in a wider range of topics than in the past. This is fine by me, because the fashion articles rank low on my list of reading priorities. I would much rather read, say, an article that debates the efforts to ban smoking than an article about buying the right shoes to wear in a business casual workplace.  Many magazines skimp when it comes to reading material but not GQ. You get your money's worth with this magazine. Each issue is the length of a book, with anywhere from 250 to 350 or more pages per issue and from 25 to 30 different featured articles, departments, and monthly columns to read (combined). This makes for a lot of reading. Even of you take the advertisement space into account, there is still plenty to read in each issue. It also means that, whatever your fancy, you should find something interesting to read every month.  Overall, GQ is a good magazine for men and it contains some decent entertainment news, political analysis, and fashion tips. It is aimed at men in their early thirties and while I don't like it as much as similar publications I still think GQ is a decent magazine. Its long length makes it easily worth the low cost and with so much reading material, there is something for everyone in each issue. What others have said is true: It isn't the magazine it once was. But there is still enough of the good stuff to recommend this publication.","GQ: Different From the Past, but Still Okay",1175212800,5.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,aim female month relationship read much and/or effort find abortion quite clad changeover like money's men say recommend space true news fine count topic think cost others culture everyone wear book get several length many enough take buy today something different mean movie contain priority magazine long range read interest shoe publication little department sex combine celebrity business lot change issue rank article whatever thirty place account right similar low scantily material men's good politics publication use security worth talk hollywood list come team stuff gq homeland effort early time magazine page reader common would entertainment debate etc wider also orient decent still casual even plenty discussion book fancy easily per year fashion deliver suffer smoke workplace tip around best overall anywhere range article cover seem spiced make featured political greatly exclusively frank ban monthly advertisement right analysis past say relate columns difference reserve every attract skimp rather

Unless you work your way through a *lot* of advertising pages to the material that follows, you may think you've picked up a catalogue rather than a 'quarterly'.  Second, GQ consistently presents excellent short and medium-length fiction and non-fiction writing. If the juxtaposition of preening male style with superb writing surprises you, well, welcome to the club. They're both undeniably here  between the same covers.  Finally, GQ offers great tips on style in a whimsical, always interesting way. Simply put, you can get edumacated on style by working through this third magazine bound into the GQ format.

Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest.

Edelman,"The New Yorker was started by Harold Ross as a humor magazine, and grew into one of the world's most celebrated literary magazines. It never really made money or had a huge circulation, but survived thanks to the generosity of a number of private owners and publishers. I began reading the New Yorker thanks to my mother, who subscribed for nearly four decades. Through it I discovered Berton Rouche's fascinating ""Medical Detective"" stories, Calvin Trillin's hilarious stories about food and travel, the brilliant writing of John McPhee, and scores of other contemporary reporters and short story writers. Then, in the 1980s, Trisha Brown then managed to completely trash the magazine in only a few short years. Circulation took off- for a time, at least- but the reputation of the New Yorker was sacrificed as it was turned into a gossip magazine. The low point, for me, at least, was a fawning article on poor Erich Honnekar's trial in Germany where he was being charged for ordering the shootings of those East Germans who tried to flee to the west. (Brown's husband, it turned out, had been retained by Honnekar's defense team to do PR work). Old time subscribers defected by the thousands, and the new subscribers, being a fickle lot, let their subscriptions lapse as well once The New Yorker was no longer a hip fashion accessory to be seen on your coffeetable alongside the latest issue of Interview. In recent years the magazine has regained some- but not all- or its former glory. The political analysis is still of the fawning variety (neither the Clintons nor the Kennedys can do any wrong) and the fiction has become even more parochial, but a lot of the good reporting has returned.

506,506,3,False,"10 31, 2009",AVF9FV7AMRP5C,B00005N7QA,X. Liu,"Forbes is a conservative business publication that delivers excellent reporting and feature articles. The content is concise, blunt, and to the point because Forbes recognizes the importance of time and clarity. The magazine is especially strong in providing advice to individuals, and businesses about upcoming changes in the tax code, and legislation that would impact the bottom line. However, I have found that the editorial content has become a venue for editors to make personal attacks towards Obama and the democratic party.  Pros: As a business magazine, Forbes does an excellent job at delivering succinct articles about business, economics, and stocks. In each issue, the magazine devotes a large section towards dispensing advice about money and investing. There is a depth and detail that can only be found in this magazine. Forbes assumes its readers are astute and smart, and is unwilling to dumb down its content to boost circulation numbers. In a recent article, Forbes provided detailed advice about retirement accounts, and their tax implications.  Cons: Forbes can improve its publication by editorializing less and focus more on business issues, and less bashing upon liberal politics. For example, Forbes can take the lead and recommend to businesses ways to reduce health care costs by writing about Safeway, which has been able to tame healthcare inflation. If the magazine authors wants to express their political beliefs, then they are working for the wrong magazine.","Forbes delivers high quality articles, but its liberal bashing gets tiring",1256947200,20.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,code express circulation conservative cost detail report author dispense legislation feature upcoming however recommend implication smart way unwilling section business obama write health job inflation want delivers pro deliver dumb towards impact con editor take advice money magazine tax less find line democratic recognizes upon attack forbes depth business issue change article number point wrong recent able detailed politics publication large account reduce become healthcare assumes individual time tame succinct reader improve especially focus would boost issue liberal venue importance concise editorial belief safeway bash bottom lead clarity blunt make provide economics retirement invest stock astute work article devote excellent content party political example provide strong personal care editorialize

It manages with cover all sorts of cutting edge stories without ever actually getting into the actual science involved. Instead, it concentrates on the people involved, the politics, the history... anything but the science. Here's an example: A recent issue had an interesting piece on the physics of rocks skipping... expect it wasn't on the physics of rock skipping so much as it was on a particular fellow was was the world's champion rock skipper. Yes, there *was* a formula in a side bar that purported to describe the physics of a skipping rock, and some of the terms were even defined... but there was no explanation of the formula, or even any numbers. It was simple ""Here's a formula. It's very impressive looking, isn't it? Now on to other things."" And there was some history of how people looked at rock skipping, and even some allusions to how the physics of rock skipping had applications in understanding the physics of other phenomena. But what you couldn't find in the entire article was a single sentance that actually discussed the physics involved! So what Discovery really is, is a magazine about science and scientists that doesn't actually have any science in it.

They're much less useful when it comes to reporting on subjective things, or on technical matters.

Sure, CR has their own labs and testers, but they're as likely as not, when confronted with something they can't quantify, to come up with some arbitrary measure and then rate products on that. For example, I've read some hilarious HiFi reviews that never involved actually *listening* to units. Instead, they take some statistic they consider to be critical and rate all units on that. Computer reviews often are very superficial- you'd do far, far better with PC or a similar magazine. And some of their financial advice on life insurance, mortgages and investment has been rather narrow, preaching single solutions for all.

Baer,"Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor.  I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion.  I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left.  Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the like) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure).  Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate.  In terms of macro-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers.  Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years.

Good Housekeeping, like many magazines if its ilk, makes its money on advertising.  Given that fact, many pages are nothing but either ads or infomercials.  Once past that, there really IS a good magazine hidden between those pages.  I have been an on again and off again subscriber since the early 80s when I returned to the U.S. after a five year stint in the military living in Europe.  You might find it odd but this magazine helped with my transition to the land of consumerism and commercialism.  Good Housekeeping keeps up with trends and ideas for the modern home.  From solar water systems to water heated floors, from pink rose pedals to rose hip tea, GH has been there.  Given the duration this magazine has been in operation, earning a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval is sometimea a boon to business and that push needed for national recognition.  GH is NOT a controversial magazine.  The editors would probably have coronaries just at the thought of causing controversy.  This is an enjoyable read, cover to cover, once the advertising is overlooked.

This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.  These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.  Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.  Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.",Popular Mechanics: Practical and often Fascinating,1282867200,2.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,nice achievement wall house like go and/or detail thought enjoy readable like foundation offer however complaint space awe fascinate human lesson among lesson agree might useful timely times car achievement consistent get nature anyone due open devote multiple technology feat advice magazine read exist mechanic record thing obvious fact innovation enthusiast offer part issue memory deal improvement subject whole cash popular impressive lengthy repair educational home good setting type publication function emphasize bore first subsection certain learn remain help time besides homeowner reader learn practical sometimes etc also talk automobile works dedicate inside sound incredible never review car continue best overall appliance often article department magazine's describe behind inspire eye expose knew example show industry provoke mechanical automotive save anything emphasis intelligent capable small

686,686,4,False,"10 17, 2004",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7U1,Bryan Carey,"Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it.  This magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort.  If there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful.  Still, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication.

Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.  Aside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.  One thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.  Writer's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.  Writer's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything.

It can also be a bit of a downer to read the stories about serious illnesses some children have had and how their families cope - not always what you're in the mood for when you're thinking about your own healthy child.  But overall, this magazine is the best one out there for parents AND they are branching out - we recently started receiving Baby Parents.

With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.  Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.

726,726,3,False,"03 9, 2013",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00005NIOR,Christopher Barrett,"I have been a subscriber to Runner's World Magazine for the past four years.  I have watched, in dismay, the slow and sure descent of this magazine into the clutches of marketers.  Let me give you an example:  Runner's World April 2013. Page 46.  Magazine recommends eggs in an added on box in the bottom right corner of the page. Page 67.  Magazine recommends eggs again stating that studies (which studies?) show that eating eggs helps reduce calorie intake.  Large picture of a fried egg.  Also several recipes recommend eggs (on the same page). Page 45.  Paid advertisement for egg whites.  Page 31.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk as an after workout recovery (gross!) Page 67.  Magazine has picture of milk cartons, recommend fat free milk. Page 74.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk again.  With picture this time. Page 39.  Paid advertisement for chocolate milk.  Seeing a trend?  It's sad really, because where is the line going to be drawn?  I don't mind the advertisements, but when the magazine starts working in recommendations based on what ads have been bought a particular month?  Will Runner's World recommend M&Ms as a post run recovery if Mars Candy Company puts in an add?  Granted chocolate milk and eggs aren't the worst... but seriously recommending eggs for a runner to lose weight?  Should we ignore the cholesterol and fat content?  Again, just picking on one thing, but I can see a trend starting to develop.  That alone wouldn't be enough to completely turn me off the magazine though.  The ads have gotten more numerous it seems, and actual content has shrunk.  More of the content is being devoted to recipes and repetitive training tips.  Great for those who buy this magazine on occasion from the new stand, but not for subscribers.  The beginners' tips are getting so repetitive that I can predict exactly what will be recommended: > Start out slow. > Interval train. > Post run stretch. > Take days off when needed. > Slowly add mileage. > Back off if too sore or injured or strained.  Also, the rave run section at the beginning?  A big glossy picture of a cool location I probably won't be able to run.  Newbie chronicles?  The stories can be humorous, but are usually just a recap of an run that a beginner took that inspired them to run more often.  There are usually a few recipes, but often they are geared towards meat eaters and don't have any really easy way to modify them for vegetarians or vegans.  I did see one recipe where the author mentioned subbing tofu and another ingredient to make it vegan.  But this is rare.  The shoe reviews have become a joke.  Basically you can expect several shoes to get 'awards' or a 'best update', but often they are incomplete comparisons and they do not have the user notes any longer.  (They used to include a few lines from testers about what they liked, now they just have one or two lines by testers per guide, not per shoe).  The best section?  ""Ask Miles.""  Also, periodically there are very good and inspiring stories.  But a lot of the stories are fluff.  It's just not worth a subscription anymore.  I bought the following book for cheap - MUCH cheaper than Runner's World was trying to sell it directly to subscribers for:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runner-s-World-Complete-Book-of-Running-Everything-You-Need-to-Run-for-Weight-Loss-Fitness-and-Competition/dp/1605295795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runner's World Complete Book of Running: Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition</a>.  $15 brand new from Amazon.  The magazine e-mailed me a trial offer for this book with the final billed amount at $35.  Sad.  But my recommendation?  Until the magazine gets back to where it was 2+ years ago, skip it.  If you really want packed information about running and training, buy the book I mentioned.  At least it's ad free!  My recommendation?  Stick to running gear ads and get away from food product ads, I think that is an area that makes money but also puts the magazine at the liberty of some of the most unscrupulous advertisers in the country (remember, food companies often pay grocery stores for better shelf space and for their products to be featured in ads and circulars).  I would also revamp the rave run section and have several (smaller) pictures of at least a dozen locations each month scattered around the country.  You could even ask readers to send in pictures and locations.  Give us a slice instead of blowing up one giant photo.  And with a selection, perhaps one of these runs might be close by.  Also have more stories and information for mid level runners.  More product reviews - the earbud reviews were nice, but there were only six or so.  That is not acceptable.  Give us 20+ earbuds and just list the ones that aren't recommended.  And try buying the products out of the budget rather than having vendors give them to the magazine.  I understand that is the nature of the game: ""want it reviewed?  Give it to us.""  But often this makes incomplete review guides.  I don't want Runner's World to go the route Outside Magazine did several years ago.  Remember the readers and the runners are #1, not advertisers.  Give the magazine the old substance and pay attention to subscribers.  Don't sacrifice the quality overall just to appeal to those folks browsing the magazine rack at Barnes and Noble.

This magazine covers places from around the world of some of the best travel websites and hotels to stay at when you are traveling to many places in Europe, Asia, etc.  However, the one feature that I do LOVE about this magazine is how they feature a special issue just on Europe each year.  I treasure these ""special issues"" that cover Europe because places all across Europe are featured. For example, I feel very lucky to own the special issues that cover just Europe from the issues of May 2008, April 2009, and April 2010. The following are some of the features from these special issues that cover Europe: 1)In the May 2008 Travel+Leisure special issue of Europe there is a feature about the many travel gems to see in Vienna, Austria and 10 London, England restaurants that are recommended by British Food critic Paul Levy. There is also a fascinating article on ideas to consider for outdoor walking in France. 2) In the April 2009 Travel+Leisure Europe special issue there is a great feature on 22 Affordable European Hotels (my favorite visual feature is The Hotel Franziskaner in Zurich, Switzerland). There is a catchy article feature on the many places to visit in Lourdes, France. 3)In the April 2010 Europe feature there is a feature on Book Lover's London and a captivating article about Europe's best wine bars. I also like the 25 undiscovered European villages that are featured (the picture of the Staufen im Breisgau, a medieval town close to the Rhine Valley in southern Germany). I very much look forward to the 2011 Europe Special issue that Travel+Leisure is going to create.    The following are some of the exciting features of the February 2011 issue of Travel+Leisure:  1) There is the feature of 25 of some of the most romantic dream trips (the country retreat of Coworth Park in Berkshire, England stands out in a good way for me). 2)There is a colorful article titled ""The Spirit of Dublin"" and some of the wonderful places to check out while in Dublin, Ireland (the cafe owner pictured on page 94 seems pretty joyful and content in her life). 3)On page 40 the fashion designer, hotelier, and Apprentice Star Ivanka Trump is featured. I do feel that it was a good idea to feature her because in my humble opinion she resourcefully utilizes the wealth and opportunities that are presented to her.

As a result, I regularly brush up against the destinations T&L points toward, though only by accident or overbooking do I end up in the executive suites.  Still, there is something here for both rich and, well, un-rich.

P. 182's 'Guide to Cairo' manages a similar multi-class helpfulness and the fine treatment of northeastern Brazil is interesting on any budget.

The kind of magazine with flashy pictures, expensive wines and places you can never afford to go to. This is a good magazine, but I find level of advertising annoying. Also, the reviews of hotels don't strike me as that reliable. Last month, based on a review in this magazine about an inn, we stayed the night at this location and found the service was awful, the 'rooms with fireplaces' not functional and the room smelled bad. These facts were conveniently left out of the review which touted the friendly staff and the great rooms. So I guess, ultimately, I'd take reviews and articles in the magazine with a grain of salt.

765,765,4,False,"01 22, 2006",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005NIOW,Bryan Carey,"Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.  I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.  One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.  One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.  One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.  Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.  Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.,1137888000,25.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,know alaska mountain television yard product nice washington black associate northern southwest read month card much eastern interior find cook wyoming divide region hawaii type country like tahoe stand percent wide california reno value decorate offer space oregon deviate way vega program nevada section travel generally cover northwest among interest might topics guess utah dish cost state culture six strike cat area everyone normally enjoyable west travel/culture/food/entertainment/home thrown detergent several favorite many furniture thing spends landscape expect everywhere garden/living ordinary sure something national emulating unique different montana budget magazine recreation may subscription range read find breakdown sacramento food idea thing friendly alternate arizona place highlight one fact dead san midwestern show page part offer new issue back las aside show anyplace place american generic highlight sense live home consider associate limited city publication stun day talk laundry design subsection full lake active reminds month southern colorado magazine advertisement design page common garden francisco sunset publish western would entertainment white service edition plant etc proven cuisine sort flower even see itemized dedicate home plenty five front rest photography day bunch aspect vacation story majority mexico scenery idea make treat catching design refuse special photograph i'm specialty set combination overall section often article channel cover typical life specific columbia blossom recipe throughout eye center make feature specially idaho people rocky specialty worthwhile credit let base example british exactly tourist united every lifestyle anything colorful ad cover family beautifully qualities personal park picture feature coastline

Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today. If you were unfortunate enough to receive a gift subscription to Maxim or, worse yet, bought one for yourself, you can no doubt bear witness to the decay.

796,796,3,False,"04 5, 2004",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005NIPP,Bryan Carey,"Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women. Maxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc. The photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the ""How to"" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The ""Bar Exam"" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information. Overall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.",Maximum Female Fun for Young Men,1081123200,12.0,,,visual garner look aim seductive month woman much interview personality find small clad entice feature like sell red adult youthful woman offer way uninhibited section gadget could average come electronic take think exam hormone tidbit young trivia toward least useless get photo many dose anyone purely effect sell eye bar idiotic amuse maxim magazine age stupidity middle long read music accompany friends little thing bend really strictly picture fact sex issue turn article spite american brainless primary far scantily reason yes intelligence go seriously good type publication gear question expose male come bit cannot almost penthouse help time improve flaw would information gain imagine unusual buy etc also close talk deny humor young plenty hurt op fashion chance occasional make flesh bordering rating photo main tempting photograph blood set overall population often article old without cover look keep people expose monthly respect joke well year always get example say amuse us keep playboy

Martin,"Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.  The world of Men's magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).  But recently as ""special gift"" for renewing my Bally's Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to ""Men's Journal Magazine"", ""a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.""  ""Men's Journal Magazine"", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood ""it"" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men's magazine.  No, ""Men's Journal"" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido's need not apply!  ""Men's Journal"" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine's central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.  However, like most magazines in America, ""Men's Journal"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, ""Men's Journal"" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men's fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.  Conclusion  When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Men's Journal Magazine.""  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to's that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men's Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that's not me.  Nonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because ""Men's Journal"" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.",The Discerning and Intellectual Cook's Magazine of Choice,1292371200,19.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,know joe case local track appreciates house woman read mind publish find advertising fake enjoy feature not-so-average like theme sell wide men say model however bent twaddle membership travel mountains depend interest come need hear half grant feature-length america might rater how-to's world health useful fitness tan expensive ride young tidbit generate represent tent next impeccably can't folk income discuss towards gender market barely seem journal happily run baser serious skinny renew groom magazine subscription range actually unlike intellectual central little write dedicate really ladies brings substance that's one conclusion healthy submarine offer page appropriate medium business issue infusion back appeal american drip sexy notable yes mention men's kind afford adventure fashion impart approximately use probably rolling day adventurous male hollywood bottom-line adventure target disposable stuff want ten certain active month litter magazine focus newsstand page entail dream populace publish thoughtfully information mostly renew thoughtful gift hey dive truth fold general also libido's still automobile weekly full-length sport sky-diving trade scuba dedicate receive inside revenue audience stone recently fashion wear heavily man subscription subject marginally current side clothe grown-ups never design impossibly short appreciate special style hither bally's vapid set two adolescent equipment article total grace magazine's instead life fare seem girl smartly spread nonetheless credit monthly hike go fill year sculpt well stare base told apply do another every lifestyle instincts look wenner colorful wannabe give intelligent sidewalk portion

This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.  One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.  Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.  This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine.

Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.  Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.  Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.  I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.

Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.  What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.  Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.  Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.  Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.",Dwell Magazine Offers Unique Designs for the Home,1257120000,15.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,mistake nice directly month bold clearly taste genre like theme stand offer do-it-yourself exist level focus factor spell present among usually topic open reader aspect alienate nothing modern many name within certainly expect plan interior distinction take something make slightly creative practicality already unique different dedication rank magazine well consult long exterior read range interesting publication idea thing mailbox one fact offer new issue rank similar favorite pack home good publication large probably livability rebuild design weirdness whether magazine time focus reader theme common page particular entertainment unusual letter still maintain home room plenty front easily else purpose boundary idea catch main i'm stick present often article magazine's cover look take specific throughout end eye make return featured overflow always extreme relate remodel base manages hundred dwell every makeover avoids

A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.  What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.  On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.  Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.  Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship.

It is a beautiful magazine with thoughtful and helpful illustrations, great articles, and interesting features. I am especially fond of the coverage of emerging trends in contemporary homes, particularly the coverage of prefab homes, culminating in the sponsorship of the ""Dwell Homes,"" which showcase outstanding contemporary prefabricated housing.  The advertisements are consistently relevant and interesting, and the magazine is good at keeping its edge with articles about relevant home furnishings, appliances, and other items that are frequently overlooked in other design magazines. I love the ""Modern Market"" section in the back of the magazine, dealing with unique products that are well targeted to the fan of the contemporary aesthetic. My only minor complaint is the occasional political agenda that appears in the articles, but it is relatively infrequent and confined to only a few (of a large number) of the contributors, like Pagan Kennedy. In general, though, the articles stay on topic and the editorial content is relevant and appropriately focused.

This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.  One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled ""Food and Wine"", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.  Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to ""Food, Wine, and Entertainment"". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.  There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.  Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes.

860,860,4,False,"12 14, 2010",A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B00005NIND,Vincent E. Martin,"Bottom-Line: A glossy well put together magazine ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  And even a not so serious one.  The world of cooking, gourmet and otherwise magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with tempting dishes of un-nameable foods we are supposed to enjoy preparing. But ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" has them all whipped with its life-sized scrumptious looking delicacies begging to be devoured.  For instance the June 2008 issue has a picture of a Cheddar Burger with Chipotle Ketchup; the life-sized burger looks absolutely delectable.  ""Bon Appetit Magazine"", which bills itself as a food and entertaining magazine, is published monthly by Conde Nast Publications Inc. and is aimed at serious-minded cooks who passionate about the dishes they prepare.  They, like me are interested in what new in the world of cooking; not only that but they, like me have a keen interest in straying from the norm in the dishes they cook.  Unfortunately like most magazines in America, ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is dedicated to cooking and the stuff of cooks.  Bon Appetit Magazine Contents  ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" --a monthly publication--is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information and divided up in the following sections:  o Fast, Easy, Fresh o Family Style: o At the Market o Cooking Life o Health Wise o Wine & Spirits o Prep School o Features  Conclusion  A glossy well put together magazine ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  However, even the not-so-serious cook will find something within the folds of the gorgeous magazine.  When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" not only because of the well put together articles and outstanding recipes, but also because the food look so darned inviting!  How come my dishes never turn out looking like the cover of a magazine?  While I have to admit that some of the recipes are a little out there, the ones I have prepared have turned out well enough.  Be prepared you will have to shop for these ingredients; the average ""Bon Appetit"" recipe does not use your usual American kitchen staples.  For instance in the June 2008 issue a recipe for Hazelnut-crusted chicken with raspberry sauce calls for lightly packed fresh raspberries, safflower oil, chopped hazelnuts, panko (Japanese breadcrumbs), and finely chopped mint leaves; not exactly stuff one might find at the local Jewel.  Did I mention that the photography in ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is a feast in-and-of-itself?

E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!  For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.  I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.

Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.  The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.

Now, my subscripiton is coming to an end. I almost didn't renew, as with other magazines of late, the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. It is not what is used to be. There seems to be a trend out there, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a cerain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazine shrink the issues without any notice what so over. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I don't know. For this reason, I didn't want to pay a lot to renew. I figured I'd renew for one more year to give it a chance, and see where the magazine is headed. Happily, the price at Amazon.com beat the renewal/new subscription prices offered by Backpacker magazine itself. Imagine that. Hopefully, Backpacker goes back to where it was, instead of where it seems to be going. If it doesn't, it'll be another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude!

Although I have tinkered with other outdoor, hiking magazines over the years, I have always held this one as my favorite.  In my opinion nobody does it better when it comes producing a publication for hikers and campers that just can't get enough of the great outdoors.  One thing I have always liked about this magazine the most is how it never fails to regularly return to the basics.  That is to say, it doesn't always assume that you are a seasoned hiker that well understands the joy and dangers of just getting away from it all in the wilderness.  It regularly carries a generous amount of articles and regular features that are fundamental enough for the novice reader or backpacker, as well as stories that deal with easier, family style hikes. It truly isn't all about just zeroing in on the big bear country adventures that the seasoned backpacker will prefer.  Though its true that there are more glossy style ads in it than ever before, as well as pull out subscription order cards and ads, (what magazine doesn't these days), it still in my opinion sticks to its guns very well in being a very interesting and excellently written magazine that I enjoy as much today as I did years back when I could actually do some of the hikes that it talks about.

This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover. Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc. Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone.

Next I got my own binouclars, started putting up feeders and taking walks with the purpose of finding birds. Finally figuered I needed to read up on the hobby of bird watching and I found Bird Watches Digest.  First of all it is a bit smaller than I would like and thus a little bit hard on my eyes (about the size of an old tv guide).  However it was filled with lots of great information and stories.  As a novice bird watcher in Las Vegas some stories and articles just did not relate to me and one or two articles per magazine were too detailed for my liking.  But all in all the issues are informative and well done and I have kept all my issues for future reference.

From the backyard feeder to the world traveler observer, BWD has enough content in all areas to satisfy anyones particular interest, on any level.  There is even a regular section in each issue dedicated to back yard birding.  It isn't a magazine that is at all snobby and considers back yard novices peasants.  On the other hand, it is also a very technical and educational periodical for those that are advanced enough to actually take advantage of the many world wide travel suggestions and deals that are offered throughout the book. I first picked up some BWD back issues on Ebay and enjoyed it enough to order a regular subscription.  I was particularly impressed by its compact size, similar to Readers Digest.  It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library. The only caution that I would suggest to anyone that decides to buy a subscription is to pass on the offer of the digest newsletter that you can subscribe too for every other month that BWD isn't offered.  At $16 a for 6 issues it is not worth it at all.  Its a very thin, (about 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that has as many ads in it as helpful info.  Its a rip off in all honesty. I let my own subscription to it lapse after the first year.  You are much better off subscribing to the BWD email that is sent out periodically that is free, and loaded with article highlights and helpful info.

Flipping through the magazine, I saw some good, okay, and bad features. Girls Life is targeted to ages 10-15, and it's good for those parents who feel as though their kid is too old for American Girl but still not old enough for YM, Teen People, etc. This magazine has advertisments, but not that many, and they're nothing inappropriate, just things like Smackers lip gloss or Secret deodorant. I think this magazine is appropriate for the age group that it is targeted to. Girls' Life has articles about school, boys, seasonal articles about holidays, fashion, real-life, celebrities (though there isn't any gossip about who's doing what),  beauty, and other topics. I don't think you should read this magazine for it's beauty and fashion articles; try Teen Vogue or Teen People for fasion and beauty. Plus, there are quizzes, celebrity features and articles, embarrasing moments stories, advice to questions sent in by real girls, letters to the editor (of course!), and other fun features. You won't find any articles about sex and college, however. My only problem with this magazine is obviously that the editors don't know what kind of girls to put on the cover and in their fashion and beauty pages. Usually, there are regular girls on the cover, sometimes a celebrity. But the thing is, Girls' Life usually doesn't put normal girls with glasses, freckels, dark hair or skin, or non-straight hair. Most of them feed us the picture of the ideal girl: tall, blonde-haird, blue-eyed, perfect complexion, no glasses, no freckels. That can ruin a girl's self-esteem, so I suggest reading this magazine not for it's models, but for the actual content.

Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.  Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.  My favorite departments in This Old House are ""Around the House"", ""Toolbox"", and ""Salvage"". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.  Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.  Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person.

Martin,"Bottom-line: ""Money Magazine"" is my new personal financial advisor and hopefully its sage advice will help me navigate the pitfalls of personal investing.  Okay, I'll admit it my latest job move left us with a little more disposable income, and a pay raise last month helped immensely.  So we now have more money to invest, but I do not want to pay someone to do it for me, I want to keep my hands on my own stash thank you very much.  But I will admit I need practical advice on where to invest my money, not only for retirement, but for my 11-year-old's college education.  I briefly though about subscribing to Fortune Magazine, but quickly dismissed the magazine: too upscale with little practical advice to the average middle class American.  I have long read the Money Magazine section on CNN.com, and found the information timely and utilitarian in the extreme.  So I decided to subscribe to the print edition.  ""Money Magazine,"" which bills itself as the magazine ""For you, your family, your future,"" is a monthly rag published by Time Warner Inc.  The magazine covers a broad swath of personal money matters from investing in education to sound retirement advice; from which stocks and bonds are the best long range pick, to the best places to live in America.  Checking in at 156 pages (this issue), ""Money Magazine"" is refreshingly free of endless pages of wall-to-wall advertising, though every other page does tend to be an advertisement; I guess they have to pay the bills somehow.  But the advertisements contained within do not interfere with information presented in the magazine, nor do they compromise the quality.  From cover to cover, page-to-page ""Money Magazine"" has proven a very useful reference source on all matter concerning personal finance.  Regular sections in the magazine include:  o Features: feature length articles; o Start: tips and helpful shorts on money management; o Plan: planning for retirement, and other financial planning articles; o Home: tips and articles dealing with the home; o Invest: investment tips and stock, bonds, and mutual funds; o Spend: smart ways to spend your money.  The latest issue featured the magazines seminal ""America's Best Places to Live"" issue, in which the periodical lists the best place to bring up a family based on certain criterion, including Education, Jobs/Economy, Safety, Ease of Living, Arts/Leisure, and Park Space. I was pleasantly surprised to find two cities I used to live on the list.  Other articles in this months (August 2006) magazine include  o The Last 401(K) Guide You'll Ever Need; five rules that really matter. o America's Best Places to Live o Everything You Know About Kids and Money is Wrong; teaching kids about money doesn't work.  Here's what needs to be done. o Hidden Assets; that dusty folder with the old savings bonds, forgotten gift certificates and yellowed insurance policies may hold some real treasures. o Can Money Buy Happiness; research sheds light on how you can (and can't) spend your way to a sunnier outlook. o Quest For The Simple Life; the Edels have raised frugal living to an art.  In our consumer culture, that's anything but simple.  The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  The most useful part is the detailed advice on stock, bonds, and mutual funds picks.  There is never a hard sell; the information is presented in a well laid out and easy to read format.  For instance in the Invest section of this months magazine, ""Money Magazine"" laid out a listing of (70) blue-chip growth stock one could invest in the long haul.  For each stock the magazine listed the name of the stock, including ticker symbol, Price, 1-Month Return, 12-month Return, P/E Ratio, Earnings Growth, and Yield of the particular stock.  The same format is repeated for bonds and mutual funds throughout the magazine.  But not all is sunshine and glossy pages.  Though I found the recent article on The Best Places to Live in America useful; it was short of a lot of pertinent information.  Cary, NC caught my wife's eye as a possible retirement spot, but the print article was short on detail.  On-line however, a lot more information was to be had including the median family income for the area, as well as median home price, and tax information.  The content on-line was much more involved; this is both a curse and a blessing; a curse for those who lack Internet access and a blessing for those who don't mind gleaming more information on-line.  I have Internet access and I would have preferred to get the information from the magazine' print edition, or both places.

It is very good at explaining terminology in plain English, which is to be applauded, but investors with more knowledge of investments and financial planning would probably be better off with another magazine, like ""Kiplinger's"", for instance. ""Money"" covers primarily investments in mutual funds, bonds, and stocks, although real estate and retirement planning are also dealt with regularly. I like the investment index feature in the back of the issue: it is honestly the only part of the magazine I routinely use anymore, although I do skim the articles, and read one or two per issue. My chief complaint with the magazine is how formulaic the articles are. It seems like every month there is an article called ""The Best Places To Put Your Money Now"", for instance.

1070,1070,4,False,"05 3, 2007",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005UMOT,Bryan Carey,"Traditional Home is a nice little magazine about home living and the many ways to make a home look great, both inside and out. This magazine takes a slightly different approach to homes when compared to others of its genre. Instead of focusing on size and modern amenities, Traditional Home directs its attention toward classic style and elegance with an up- to- date twist.  Home decorating/improvement are the main subjects in Traditional Home and there are several departments and main features dedicated to adding a touch of classic style to your house. One article might talk about the addition of different comforters and pillows to your bedroom. Another could talk about adding antique clocks to your family room. Still another might focus on sprucing up the outside of your home by planting flowering bushes. These features and departments all have the same goal in mind: To take a plain, drab room or exterior and spice it up with some old- fashioned elegance.  Not all of the pages in Traditional Home are dedicated to the subject of decorating. The magazine does offer a few more subject areas to make it better rounded. It is common, for example, to find an article or two about home entertainment and this is especially true around the holiday season. There are also some articles that are related to travel; e.g., travel to visit a unique antique shop or partake in a home decorating event.  Traditional Home is a classy magazine and there are many things I like about this publication. One nice quality is that the suggestions for decorating are not comprised of items exclusively for the rich and famous, like many other, similar magazines. Yes, there are some more expensive ideas presented here but there are an equal number of less expensive ideas for both decorating and for entertaining. Another quality I like is the personal touch so common in most of the articles. Ordinary people share their personal stories about why they chose to remodel their bathroom the way they did; why they celebrate Christmas the way they do; or why they added a collection of antique art to their family room. These personal touches help make the magazine more then just a buyer's guide- they make it a magazine that is nice to read and relate to.  Overall, Traditional Home is a nice magazine about homes, decorating, and entertaining with plenty of colorful photos that offer great interior visual appeal. It is amazing what can be done to an ordinary room with some dedicated effort, and Traditional Home aims to guide readers in this direction; helping to turn a plain, boring home into a feast for the visual senses.","Decorations, Entertainment, and More",1178150400,53.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,visual nice guide house decorating/improvement effort find shop genre way event touch like decorate partake true approach way twist travel share could spice present e.g traditional might room expensive others plant toward modern several photo many fashion take interior ordinary addition great slightly bedroom unique different amaze direction magazine well size date exterior less read season little clock thing idea comprise department one pillow elegance bush offer touch aim quality turn article appeal subject add compare comforter similar yes feast bathroom home directs publication add outside collection help boring item number classy equal help magazine focus mind page common especially buyer's living entertainment also flower holiday talk visit still area attention dedicate home inside plenty reader amenity art celebrate chose plain antique subject sense remodel story rich make main rounded christmas drab style around overall two spruce classic article old instead look take relate entertain exclusively people famous goal focus example another relate do suggestion personal colorful family feature

Plus, the topics covered in it are nothing really special, the fashion pages are lackluster, and the advice columns and such, well, SUCK.

They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.  My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.  National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.  National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.  Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.","National Geographic Kids: Too Much Fluff, too Little Education",1336262400,9.0,,,visual surprise know aim age month likes much bright work break focus teach way elementary notice sum fluff like science value education could subtle meaningless trivia newsletter receive child several scar many due name expect seem take big problem great national expertise element cover entertain later different third color geographic technology fan must learn money magazine well long surprising read unfortunately remain publication thick little thing really intermingle one annoying quality article girl spite mail material educational exception isolate good limited publication load worth together attempt geography first item bit game thin school permit help magazine advertisement mind page flaw especially would resource present everything issue etc also suppose even see mainly form book year plentiful subject forward kid avoid contain make photograph educate overall often magazine's look include seem content entertain worthwhile available expect animal do minimal may colorful ad keep improvement picture

It's about good food, prepared in the best possible way. It's thin magazine, but what's missing in the advertising, not the content. Every issue contains more good cooking information than a year of most food magazines. The typical issue takes a number of classic dishes- pot roast, chicken diablo, hamburgers, whatever- and follows the cooks as they try different methods and ingredients to come up with the best possible way of preparing the dish.

They review cookbooks and in their very own in depth fashion, go into detail in describing how they test the recipes in these cookbooks.

Baer,"The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine.  There's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy, pleasing publication. But if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. Just enjoy the game.  That game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. This reader is in it for the long haul - I hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the Wine Spectator is my companion along the way.  My job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like France, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and - of course - Northern California.  But with wineries now in 49 of the USA's fifty states, what's *not* a wine region these days?  On those business treks, I find myself out for dinner as often as not. It's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a Pinotage in Capetown, since only South Africa produces this varietal, or to opt for one of Argentina's persuasive Malbecs because they're just *that* good.  We're not talking wine snobbery here, just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys.  If this sounds like your game, the Wine Spectator may be a worthwhile investment. Even if not, consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. That's what I do.

1117,1117,4,False,"12 21, 2005",A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00006GXD4,Bryan Carey,"Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.  Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.  To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.  Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers.  In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations.

1151,1151,4,False,"12 15, 2010",A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B00007AVYI,Vincent E. Martin,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.  Like most men in their twenties I was a car guy.  I ate and drank the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, and colored sheet metal.  I could recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  I subscribed to and devoured all of the (four) the nation's most popular car magazines of the time: ""Car & Driver,"" Motor Trend, Road & Track, and the beauty queen of them all, Automobile Magazine.  But as time and overseas assignments took my attention elsewhere, one-by-one my subscriptions lapsed and my car fetish all but died.  But, now in the autumn of my life, I have rekindled my love of cars, especially expensive high performance mid-sized cars from well-known and well respected nameplates we all know: Cadillac, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Lincoln, Jaguar, and of course Mercedes-Benz.  So when I got a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail, I plowed through the 230 or so men's magazines before finally deciding on ""Car & Driver Magazine"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.  Like most car magazines, ""Car & Driver"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine offers so much more.  Unlike the other automobile periodicals, ""Car & Driver"" serves up truly useful (practical) information for the everyman, or woman.  This subtle distinction elevates ""Car & Driver"" above the rest and makes it far and away the best car rag for my hard earned money.  However, like other three American car magazines ""Car & Driver"" covers a broad swath of the American automobile scene, but it also does a fair job of delving into the international automobile scene as well.  And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Aveo's of this world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Car & Driver"" magazine.  And the magazine does this is a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.  For instance in the October 2008 issue ""Car & Driver"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Acura ZDX, Alfa 8C Spider, 2011 BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, 2010 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 Convertible, 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP, plus a comprehensive write-up on The Best Cars for $20,000.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive comparison article: Audi R8 V-10 vs. Ferrari 430 Scuderia, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine this side of the pond.  Another strong incentive to read ""Car & Driver"" is its decided lack of wall-to-wall advertisements.  Most of the magazine is dedicated to substance; the articles are what make ""Car & Driver"" such a joy to read.  The articles are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  And although the writers fill the paragraphs with lexicon of the automobile industry, the prose never talks down to the reader, or looses my interest along the way.  Another way ""Car & Driver"" distinguishes itself from the rest, is its more than comprehensive write-up on each automobile within the magazine.  Even the shortest articles, or write-up's feature a detailed description of the car, its interior and exterior specifications, road test results, pricing, and possible competitors.  No other magazine that I have read thus far--Automobile, Motor Trend, or Road & Track--offers as much useful information.

They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.  Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.  I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.  Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.",Can't Curb Your Enthusiasm?

I liked the look and content of this magazine and subscribed for three years twice. In a month my subscripiton will come to an end and I doubt I will renew. The quality and quanitity of the magazine has dropped quickly over the last few months. The pages have noticeably been fewer and more advertisements seem to fill most of the pages now.

There seems to be a trend out there, sadly, not just with this magazine, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable when you handle the issue. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a certain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazines are shrinking the issues without any notice what so over to the subscriber. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I just don't know. I have noticed that Amazon price beats the price directly offered by the magazine itself and I don't get that. Hopefully, nat Geo Traveler will go back to where it was, though I doubt it, if people are willing to contiually pay the same $$ for less pages, why should they? For this reason, this is another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude!

1221,1221,4,False,"12 15, 2010",A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B00007B1AI,Vincent E. Martin,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.  Like a lot of middle-aged men I am a car guy.  I eat and drink--more or less--the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, painted wheels, ergonomic cockpits, and colored sheet metal.  I can recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  At various times in the last five years I have subscribed to and devoured three of the nation's most popular car magazines: Motor Trend, Automobile, and Car & Driver.  But, I recently gave up my subscription to Automobile and received a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail; I replaced it with ""Road & Track Magazine,"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.  Like most car magazines, ""Road & Track Magazine"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine has little to distinguish itself from its brethren.  I used to read ""Road & Track Magazine"" back in my twenties, and while the magazine has moved itself smartly into the 21st century, the basic formula that made the magazine fun and informative back in the 1980's remains virtually unchanged.  ""Road & Track Magazine"" does an excellent job of covering the national (American) and International car scene. And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Volt's, Suzuki Swift's and Toyota Corolla's of the world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Road & Track Magazine.""  And the magazine does this is in a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.  For instance in the June 2010 issue ""Road & Track Magazine"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Jaguar XJ, Audi R8 Spyder; Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 vs. Nissan GTR vs. Porsche 911 Turbo; plus a long-term test wrap-up of the Acura TL SH-AWD, as well as a features write-up on the Suzuki Swift, Mazda Demio, and Toyota iQ.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive competition articles: Electric Boogaloo -Tesla vs. Lotus, and Formula 1, Then & Now, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine in the country.  Because of its name ""Road & Track Magazine"" does seem to cover the racing circuit more than it fellows, which would be fine if I followed Formula 1, NASCAR, and notable figures from that world, but I don't so I tend to skip over those articles.  Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up an excellent 2-page article on the past, present and future of the spark plug!  Not exactly need to know information, but for anyone with a keen interest in the internal combustion engine--like me--this article hit the spot.  When the final page is turned is ""Road & Track Magazine"" different enough from the other two car periodicals I read to renew my subscription?  In a word: no.  While I certainly enjoy reading the magazines various articles and columns there just isn't enough between the glossy covers to justify renewing the subscription.  I'm just not into the auto racing scene and ""Road & Track Magazine"" is big into Formula 1, NASCAR and other racing related themes.  For raw, general automotive new ""Road & Track Magazine"" is not as good as Motor Trend, Automobile, or Car & Driver.  But with a subscription cost of only $9.97 (or less, over at Magazines.com) per year, you can afford to grab 12 issues and make up your own mind.",The Car Magazine for the Racing Circuit Guy,1292371200,22.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,invite recite fear competition cover fine tidbit time last turn spyder follow iq certainly filipacchi different renew write-up subscription read fun write really swift's torque notable home xj arena fellow magazine theme would information publish metal coupon gtr boogaloo porsche hit received toyota swift specification plus tl circuit two horsepower audi year automotive guy combustion replace know knowledge volt's enjoy informative like useful cost car intersperse nissan name within instance serious cockpit e-mail long rpm's eat tesla page new future list make electric reader raw various auto issue general also inside esoteric five race grab per year road nugget devour test turbo tend paint scene long-term resting figure unchanged feature basic three u.s offer exactly formula picture justify give subscribe sheet virtually spot brought country wheel extremely skip previews/road carlines interest need receipt motor expensive job drink--more off-beat sh-awd anyone enough big ergonomic equally june less found wrap-up word little format lot back deal place american good use exotic mind present acura gleam magazines.com recently me--this make middle-aged car i'm jaguar article driver smartly well related final colorful suzuki mazda track via lotus reading find remain nascar move men brother add world engine--like demio trend spark elixir national test century magazine corvette international twenty medium need issue comparison article popular comprehensive mention follow reach afford chevrolet less--the bottom-line full color page nation's distinguish easy periodical glossy bring plug far-a-field corolla's vary cover automobile excellent seem hachette monthly past column renew inc internal keen cover feature follow

I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!  Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine.

Each issue is about 130 pages in length and can be counted on to stimulate your intellectual curiosity. One thing that makes Scientific American more appealing than other science magazines is the fact that it includes articles on more than just the physical sciences, like physics, chemistry, geology, etc. It also contains timely and informative articles on social sciences, like economics and politics. This adds a lot to the magazine's appeal, and it's one of the main reasons why I choose to read it each month. One thing that might bother some potential readers of this magazine is that Scientific American does tend to present a mostly pro- government angle on the social and human interest stories that it presents. In almost every instance, the writers of Scientific American draw the immediate conclusion that only the government can possibly solve the pressing issues of the day. They don't even give much consideration to anything else. They immediately concede most any problem to the authority of the state. In spite of the ""liberal"" leanings, however, I feel that Scientific American is still a very good publication to read.

Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere?

We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or ""Global Warming"".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to ""sustainable"" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of ""greenies"" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates.

Every article was written by a researcher in that field, and nothing was dumbed down. Every October, SciAm published a special issue that covered just one topic in depth, and these special issues presented the state of the art in that area in a way that was readable and understandable to the non-specialist, but at the same time could have served as a text for the student in that area. Some of those special issues were re-published as book, and when I was a grad student, the special issue on The Brain was actually used as a text for one of my seminars.  Today's SciAm is a sad, pale, echo of that once great journal. Most of the pieces are short, superficial, one or two page essays that can be quickly skimmed over. Much of the content deals with policy issues, not the underlying science. And whereas mathematics is the common language of science, the tool that (as a friend once remarked) keeps scientists honest, there's not a whisper of it in today's SciAm- a particularly sad thing given that one of the most popular features in the old SciAm was Martin Gardner's column on recreational mathematics! Gone also is the Amateur Scientist, a section in which serious amateurs would present their research programs, complete with detailed drawings of apparatus. It was here I first read about experimental rocketry, constructing computers (in the 1960s!) and building telescopes.  When I was a student in middle school, forty years ago, I found much of the math daunting, but that only spurred me on to study more and learn the tools that would unlock the knowledge found in the articles. Today, it's a magazine that  requires nothing of the reader. Facts are presented in a superficial way as absolute truths, and the magazine is designed to be skimmed over, and discarded.

Scientific American seems to have more of the lengthier feature articles that go into more depth on a particular subject. For instance, in the latest issue I am currently reading (Dec. 2011) there are nine feature articles covering a diverse array of subjects such as: technology, space exploration, biology, climate change, neuroscience, animal behavior, forensics, and education. I always find a number of articles that I am interested in reading in every issue.  Some articles I found very interesting in recent past issues are:  * Hidden Switches in the Mind - a fascinating article on epigenetics. * Waiting for the Higgs - an article about the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs. * The First Americans - who were these people and how did they get here. * A Formula for Economic Calamity - an interesting article on Wall Street's betting our future on flimsy science.  There are also many departments covering various subject matter. In this issue, I count twelve departments. Some departments I find interesting are Advances, The Science of Health, Skeptic, and Recommended. These cover short special interest topics.

Keefer,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.  You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.  VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace.

The end of the year issue making predictions for the following year is very broad and interesting. The anonymously written articles are annoying. Why hide your opinions? The magazine promotes lessening or eliminating corporate taxes and not raising tax rates on the rich, while promoting government-paid: training programs based on what local employers want, cash assistance for employees who move over two hours from a new job, intensive home visits with health and nutrition care for children younger than preschool, expanded preschool, and earned income credits contingent on work so as to discourage poor people from not having paid employment (instead of taking care of their own young children).  Who's supposed to pay for these programs?  The declining middle class? Their promotion of unhealthy homosexual ""marriages"" and applause at the ""gentle"" decline of worldwide fertility rates from 6 children per woman in 1960 to about 2 children per woman indicates their population control agenda and distorted sexual viewpoint.

One son said he wished I would read it so we could discuss it.  Anytime your offspring want to talk to you, that's an incentive.  I am impressed with the organization of this magazine. It opens with The world this week and Leaders and Briefing. It is then organized by geography: United States, The Americas, Asia, China, Middle East and Africa, Europe, Britain and International with a special section on Brazil in this issue.  Then it covers topics: Business, Finance and economics, Schools brief, Science and technology, Books and arts and Economic and financial indicators.  I like the global perspective this magazine offers with the U.S. just being one player.  Articles are deep and comprehensive with information that isn't easily available elsewhere in mainstream publications.  This week the cover article is on the extraordinary comeback of al-Qaeda and how it holds sway over more territory and is recruiting more fighters than any time in its 25 year history.  In Iraq since we left prematurely, the magazine indicates, over 1000 civilians a month are being murdered by al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda wants to bring Iraq, Syria and Lebanon together into a single caliphate.  Those are just some of the interesting facts in this magazine. While reading it, I felt I was immersed in a high-level course in international politics and economics.  If you read this magazine every week, in a short time you would be up to date and literate on global issues and economics.  I enjoyed the book review of the new book on Salinger in this issue.

If you're affiliated with an academic institution, you can get it for around seventy-seven dollars for a whole year.  This, as far as I understand, is for all levels and both sides of the dais.  I don't know how strict they are on checking up on that, but as far as I've seen, it is only offered through the website.  It is worth it.  They identify as a center-right 'newspaper' in England.  This makes it somewhat of a center-left paper in the States.  My own politics are further to the left than the editorial voice of The Economist, but for my money there is no better weekly news magazine.  I grew up stealing my father's Time and Newsweek magazines.  I liked them, but have over time shifted towards focusing on popular culture and towards a dumbed down-audience.  Perhaps my own expectations grew to be more curious about the world than what the actors on 'Friends' thought about their success.  The Economist meets those expectations.  They cover the world, in depth.  They're still something of an establishment voice, so if you want to reinforce your left or right radical leanings, you need to seek another publication to supplement your views.  I for one, keep the Monthly Review.  I tried to do it all in one publication, but I dropped the Nation because it was over-focused on the American Left, and I felt silo-ed.  The depth is the selling point.  There are several sections covering Africa, Latin America, the U. S., Britain, general economic news, science, and the arts.  Each of these sections contain several articles, with a section-closing editorial from the Economist's editorial teams.  The depth is the biggest drawback though.  There's so much there that if you want to read it cover-to-cover, it is a good investment of your time.

The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.  Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.  Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.  Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.  The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.  Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.  Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.  Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.",Enticing Photos and Great Articles,1153699200,43.0,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},,alaska activity erie away price involve read much demand find quite current miami type dollar hawaii enjoy padre entice chaos destination price sea like sell reasonable cufflink california residence event comprise true pace york section supply deal average pay share caribbean know opportunity usual useful expensive presentation state others cost merchandise mexico time area lot next relates can't reader concentrate journalism property get high family lakes photo many furniture extensive within expect professionally take seem big great make already american sell mean feel advice magazine well couple interested long range read interest less decorate pertains provide bargain little friendly thing vacation boston lie place highlight protected course adjacent frequently offer part new city article make lesser place unknown buyer affordability popular try quaint far low cape large live able good ten city large grace island lack item price major promote number bit want lake cheap remember besides intend finding page sale coastline common living pitcher entertainment coast give sometimes buy general also nightlife orient ohio's close south area see proximity reference home include fast fancy photography waterfront vacation story property majority inner occasional vary delaware reach willing main domestic photograph costly overall often article coastal purchasing include life excellent impossible cod feature greatly people lawn well tourist million united example u.s personal emphasis keep portion michigan coastline

Yes, it treats topics in a very surface way, and is probably best suited for the armchair farmer, rather than the one with callouses. The article on dairy udders was interesting, but it was a salad, not a steak. No meat. Had I written it, even with years away from milking, it would have filled a lot more pages. Kudos, BTW, on finding a Holstein with a shapely udder. Those were few and far between in my milking years.  It's entertaining but just not enough substance. I have been considering growing mushrooms, so I was excited to see the Fungi Fruit article. Well, 2.5 pages later, all I really learned is that the pricey portabellas are just regular button mushrooms from a second or third flush. Lots of pretty pictures, but I was looking for information. Sadly lacking.  Bottom line, if you like to read brief interesting articles and look at pretty pictures because you are dreaming a happy fantasy of farm life, you'll like this magazine.

Martin,"Bottom-line: While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  The New Year brought a new commitment to fitness; Yeah!  But no, this time I'm serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading ""US Weekly Magazine,"" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.  I am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but ""US Weekly"" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, ""US Weekly"" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  ""US Weekly"", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.  There are no articles in ""US Weekly"", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  ""US Weekly"" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood's Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a ""Winner!"" while poor Jessica was ""Scary!"" after her sojourn under the knife.  Regular sections in the magazine include:  o Hot Hollywood o Hot Pics o Features o News o Style o In Every Issue  But lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although ""US Weekly"" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) ""guy"" territory.  Conclusion  While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.

Yeah it is pure fluff and nothing to be taken remotely seriously however I get my kicks out of some of the articles that are published there. My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet. I found that quite distasteful. Even that tabloid People Magazine gave a couple of pages to both celebrities. What is just as gross is seeing really unattractive celebs in their bathing suits (i.e Avril Lavigne and her guitar player). However I do love the best & worst dressed pages in the back. I love the snide remarks from the weekly guests. I don't care who is the best dressed, it is who is wearing the ugliest outfits that I care. Another celebrity couple I could live without seeing in the pages of US Weekly for the rest of my life...Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Oh lordy. The two most boring celebrities known to mankind.

Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:  ""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...) ""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals"" ""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves"" ""Get Hit On All The Time"" ""Orgasm Whisperer"" ""First Time Sex Bloopers"" ""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""  I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men...

The ""pre"" of the makeovers usually look better than the ""post""; they do a haircut and makeup and stuff these ladies into silly skirts and peplum jackets (think Joan Collins from Dynasy if you are that old - I am!) that don't flatter their figures. Most of the family stuff doesn't apply either.  I do enjoy the crafts sometimes, and the recipes sometimes offer a gem. The budget dinners are interesting, but I can usually beat their pasta and soup per-dinner prices while serving burgers or roast.

I have been s subscriber for nearly 15 years and although I do not agree with many of their reviews, there is always something interesting to read in the magazine. The only thing that irks me a lot is their opinion that THE WALKING DEAD is the best TV show on the air since the invention of sliced bread. Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS. Just because a TV show has taboo-breaking gore on it does not make it a great series. What about M*A*S*H, THE WIRE, THE SOPRANOS, ST. ELSEWHERE, OZ, JUSTIFIED, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, AMERICAN HORROR STORY or any other good show that made or makes TV worthwhile?

The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.  The only thing I don't like about the magazine is that it's starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there's a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I'm not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I'm not happy that now it's four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It's the same for books and television and other media, as well.

Most of the fashions and cosmetics are, of course, waaayyy out of the price range of the average reader.  The stories are rumors you can get much cheaper via supermarket tabloids, or ""quotes"" from a ""source"" that's supposedly ""close"" to the celebrity, or paragraphs of what the person ""might"" do, based on trends or what their celeb pals have done in the past.  Usually these are incorrect.  A few months ago I the magazine gushed about Princess Kate's pregnancy with twins, and how Buckingham Palace ""should confirm"" it soon.  Today the cover squeals that Kate and her sister Pippa are both pregnant, Kate with a girl and Pippa with a boy.  I won't hold my breath over it.  Subscribe to US or PEOPLE if you want intelligently-written articles about celebs and others in the news.

I didn't appreciate his gratuitous digs at China, but more importantly, the article meandered on forever without any useful detail or statistics.  ""God Help You. You're on Dialysis"" was much better, though covering the topic of those unfortunate enough to require kidney dialysis. Every year, over 100,000 Americans start, and 25% die within 12 months, a fatality rate the writer report as one of the worst in the developed world - despite spending about $77,000/patient, believed to be more than any other nation. Meanwhile, our government has kept secret clinic-specific data that could help patients make better decisions (Medicare agreed to release them after this article), and the two corporate chains dominating the system (DaVita, Fresnius) together earn about $2 billion in operating profits/year. More than 80% are for-profit.  The author reviewed inspection reports for more than 1,500 clinics out of 5,000 from 2002-09, finding reports of filthy or unsafe conditions in almost half the units checked. Sixty clinics had at least five citations for prescription errors. Consequences are seldom meaningful - just 16 clinics were closed from 2000 to 2008.  Italy spends about one-third less than the U.S., and only about 11% die each year, vs. 20% in the U.S. Patients have more than 5X as much contact with their physicians as in the U.S. Patients start dialysis sooner than in the U.S.  The 'good news' is that Medicare is now moving to improve dialysis care.  ""Your Child Left Behind"" reports on a study by Hanushek that compares individual American states with foreign countries, looking at 15-year-old students ranked as the best at math in each location. Only 6% of U.S. students perform at the advanced-proficiency level in math, lagging some 30 other nations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, Belgium, and Netherlands, in that order. OECD nations trailing us included only Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and Mexico. Massachusetts ranks as the best state, behind 16 other nations. Even restricting U.S. students to whites or those with at least one college-educated parent put New York below Poland's all children, and Illinois' pupils with at least one college-educated parent performed lower than all students in Iceland, France, Estonia, and Sweden.

After subscribing to the Kindle version for about a year, I've decided that it's not quite worth it. I'm switching to the print edition.

This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue. Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.  The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.  Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.  Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events.

One great exercise is to challenge yourself to find something you like in each room even if you don't particularly like a room--it can be a lamp, a rug, a pillow, or piece of art, but you begin articulating and stretching your taste.

This magazine provides enough content that it takes me more than one sitting to finish it all, which I think is a good thing.  BTW, when I signed up for this magazine, I wasn't sure what they meant by ""southern"". Subsequently, I learned that this magazine caters to people as far north as Maryland. West Virginia is included too. In other words, this magazine caters to an audience that is wider than I first thought, which I think is a good thing.  I also like the current editor a lot - I think he does a good job of balancing the need to keep the magazine relevant / current with the desire to tie the new issues into the larger Southern Living legacy. He lets the magazine celebrate tradition without being overly stuffy or being overly resistant to change and/or modern tastes. In other words, the magazine keeps its unique voice but also stays fresh/current too.  One additional comment is that Southern Living always has lovely covers.

Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try. I'll try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I'll remember to pay attention to the sugar.  ~The Rebecca Review",Roasted Banana Bars with Browned Butter Pecan Frosting,1486598400,,,,i'll amount bar find roasted cooking carbs pay half try think next banana least get i'd fat seem brown rebecca magazine less found play personally future wrong sweet go afford banana brown reduce first light remember butter time cup also frost recipe attention healthier delicious reduce around mean instead try seem cake recipe sugar say three low pecan review

Esquire pushes well beyond my limits. The April 2012 edition (my last) makes a perfect example. The table of contents appears on page 25; advertisements packed between it and the cover:  Bvlgari Giorgio Armani Ermenegildo Zegna Dolce & Gabbana Calvin Klein Woodford Reserve Lincs DC & Co Newport Beach Film Festival Hugo Boss Luminox Moontower Comedy & Oddity Fest Buick  That's 24 pages of advertisements before you reach the first editorial copy. And if you think that's an unfair representation, let me share that the next 20 pages includes ads for JC Penny, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Canali, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ford, Breitling, Hickey Freeman, Gucci and Citibank. Within the next 20 pages, there are two more pages thinly spread with a table of contents, a staff listing, and only four pages of content, one of which carries the staff listing jump.  So, in the first 45 pages of Esquire, there are less than four pages of actual content.  Only one article, ""Miracle"" by Craig Davidson, was of the quality that I'd come to expect from Esquire. The nine-page piece (two pages serve as bloated title art) explores the medical advancements of synthetic hormones to delay age-related conditions.  The Sofia Vergara cover garners two thumbs up from me. However, only three more pictures of her appear in the magazine. Three! That's reason enough to fire an editor, maybe a couple. I can only take so many pictures of shaggy, bearded, brooding men hawking shoes, watches and cologne. If you are going to put Sofia Vergara on the cover, at least have the decency to treat your readers to a longer layout, at least a half dozen pages.  What's left is a choppy, increasingly juvenile collection of short articles and humor that illustrates how much Maxim and the other Laddies infected the entire men's magazine industry. The April 2012 edition included these one-page, puddle skippers:  Levi's made and crafted Mad Men's fifth season New books by Stephen King and John Grisham How picky are sperm banks? Keyboard shortcuts we need  In summary, Esquire is at the 1977 Elvis stage of life. I look back on the old issues with the same fondness I once held for Men's Health, Playboy and GQ. For a magazine approaching its 80th anniversary, Esquire needs some of those synthetic hormones to ward off its bloated visage and marked decline in quality features. Someone forgot being entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. Simply, today's Esquire is shallow and Maxim-esque.

1910,1910,4,False,"12 12, 2010",A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B000LXHJFK,Vincent E. Martin,"Bottom-Line: When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine;"" who knows the magazine just might make me a better man!  The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Esquire"" magazine stands out as a periodical with substance, style and intellect, but at the same time is not afraid to feature a beautiful woman on the cover and within it glossy folds.  ""Esquire Magazine,"" whose tag line is Man at His Best, was founded in 1933 and is published monthly by the venerable Hearst Corporation.  The magazine has a long history of featuring noted authors of their day, including Malcolm Muggeridge, William F. Buckley, and Truman Capote among other notables.  However, ""Esquire Magazine"" is known and has been known as much for its artsy cover designs as its high-brow content and had given birth to a few notable art designer careers.  To this date the cover of ""Esquire,"" remains a work of art with big bold colors, and larger than life personas framed by flowing text.  The covers alone rival another venerable men's magazine--Playboy--in style and sex appeal.  The only difference is that ""Esquire"" gives equal deference to men on its covers, though they--thankfully--are not shown in various stages of undress.  ""Esquire Magazine""--a monthly publication, is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information, from its (mostly) useless monthly column The Guide to Sex to the interesting 10 Things You Don't Know about Women, written by a different female celeb, which I find somewhat useful.  The first third of the magazine is devoted to these little nuggets of information designed to help craft a better man.  In addition to the monthly Features section, Esquire also includes a rather lengthy and engaged celebrity interview; this month it is Angelina Jolie, two months ago it was the delectable Halle Barry.  Some might find these sort of celeb-driven interview trite, given the massive print and video coverage already afforded far too many so-call celebrities, but there is something to be learned from the oft-candid gab-fests with the stars.  But, ""Esquire Magazine"" because it is a men's magazine, does pay homage to barely dressed, well crafted (meaning air-brushed) women within it covers, just not so many as, say Maxim or Stuff, but they are well represented.  And ""Esquire Magazine"" in not above objectifying women as its yearly Sexist Woman Alive anointment clearly shows.  The reigning queen Scarlett Johansson is set to give up her crown soon to a new winner, so the magazine has started drooping clues as to who the next winner will be; it is up to us to figure out who before the moniker is bestowed upon another blonde-haired, blue eyed American beauty; women of color need not apply it seems.  However, If the two latter magazines take the stance that the way to a man's mind it through his eyeballs and groin, ""Esquire Magazine"" appeals to a higher sensibility hinting that men might just learn a thing or two from the fairer sex, thus elevating the intellectual discourse between the genders.  And great writing is still at the forefront of the magazines agenda.  If the first third of the rag is dedicated to the snippet, the later half is devoted to lengthy articles, with little or no commercial interruption (YES!).  Excerpts from novels written by both males and females find a home within ""Esquire Magazine"".  And authors, both known and unknown grace the pages.  But there are investigative articles as well, which I less compelling but, but welcome nonetheless.  A recent article featured a man who is now in charge of security at a major nuclear power plant in the U.S. who used to work for Blackwater as a paid gun for hire.  The article portrays the man as something more than a macho ape with a gun for hire; he is given a decidedly human face and heart, which I found oddly engaging.  Conclusion  When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine"".  When I first picked one up years ago I was convinced that there was nothing for me within its (somewhat) high brow pages, but I have come to enjoy the magazines style and substance, though I must admit that most of the advertising is not designed for someone of my limited financial station; yes I make a good living, but little of my current income is disposable enough to by a $500.00 wrist watch even if I wore them, which I don't.  But if you are banned (for whatever reason) from reading the quintessential male magazine, Playboy, ""Esquire Magazine"" comes in close second, followed by GQ.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, Esquire Magazine might be for you.  Now that I have started my subscription ($10.00 for a year from Magazines.com), I doubt I will let it lapse, it is turning out to be just that good.

Instead, you will be treated to lots of pictures of fashionable style setters not only on the red carpet, but, MOST IMPORTANTLY, in street clothing.

Inexpensive fashion, makeup tips, healthcare, nutrition, fitness, relationships, family, etc... It doesn't prefer one to the other and there are useful tips jotted all over the place that are truly useful. There are very few ads in the magazine and the ones they do have usually come with useful coupons.  It seems to market young moms ages 25-40.  I am 31 and when this magazine comes in the mail, I honestly read it front to back.  No useless stories or expensive fashion that is out of my reach.  I just hope it stays as consistent and true to the market they are reaching.  Thanks All You!!!  7/29/08 UPDATE:  I just reordered this for another 2 years.  This magazine is still great and I actually start thinking about when another issue will be hitting my mailbox which hasn't happened since I was a teen.  Top 10 Favorite Parts: 1. Sudoku, Futoshiki, Crossword and Picture Puzzles in every issue 2. Table of Contents shows a picture of the front cover with page numbers for each tag - quick to flip to what interests you. 3. Easy layout to read. There are ordered sections called You Self, Your Health, Your World, Your Home, Seasonal, and In Every Issue. 4. Normal everyday people - no stick figure models in the this mag. 5. Fashion, decorating and make-up suggestions are all normal brands at normal stores (Target, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Old Navy, LLBean, Pier 1) 6. Little fluff and most of the ads that are in there have coupons 7. Safe enough to leave on the table around kids (no kinky stuff) 8. Just enough family and kid-fun info but majority appeals to women so you don't feel so mommyish readying it 9. No gossip or celebrity picture.  I don't buy anything that pays scummy paparazzi. 10.  I can read it from beginning to end the first day and still go back to the issue multiple times thru the month for decorating, fashion and recipe ideas.  Great value  I normally don't write long reviews but this is truly a great magazine!  EDIT:  7/7/09 - BEFORE you order this magazine PLEASE look over the time it takes to get your first one in the mail.  Amazon states it takes 6 to 10 weeks from the day you purchase right at the top of the page.  All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and ""it's been a whole month!""  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.  EDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.  You can get it a few weeks quicker going directly to their publishing department but I like the magazine subscription reminder thru Amazon as opposed to getting paper mail from publishers.

Both magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.  Both have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.  BusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called ""The Bottom Line"".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.  A big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).  The selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.

Inexpensive fashion, makeup tips, healthcare, nutrition, fitness, relationships, family, etc... It doesn't prefer one to the other and there are useful tips jotted all over the place that are truly useful. There are very few ads in the magazine and the ones they do have usually come with useful coupons.  It seems to market young moms ages 25-40.  I am 31 and when this magazine comes in the mail, I honestly read it front to back.  No useless stories or expensive fashion that is out of my reach.  I just hope it stays as consistent and true to the market they are reaching.  Thanks All You!!!  7/29/08 UPDATE:  I just reordered this for another 2 years.  This magazine is still great and I actually start thinking about when another issue will be hitting my mailbox which hasn't happened since I was a teen.  Top 10 Favorite Parts: 1. Sudoku, Futoshiki, Crossword and Picture Puzzles in every issue 2. Table of Contents shows a picture of the front cover with page numbers for each tag - quick to flip to what interests you. 3. Easy layout to read. There are ordered sections called You Self, Your Health, Your World, Your Home, Seasonal, and In Every Issue. 4. Normal everyday people - no stick figure models in the this mag. 5. Fashion, decorating and make-up suggestions are all normal brands at normal stores (Target, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Old Navy, LLBean, Pier 1) 6. Little fluff and most of the ads that are in there have coupons 7. Safe enough to leave on the table around kids (no kinky stuff) 8. Just enough family and kid-fun info but majority appeals to women so you don't feel so mommyish readying it 9. No gossip or celebrity picture.  I don't buy anything that pays scummy paparazzi. 10.  I can read it from beginning to end the first day and still go back to the issue multiple times thru the month for decorating, fashion and recipe ideas.  Great value  I normally don't write long reviews but this is truly a great magazine!  EDIT:  7/7/09 - BEFORE you order this magazine PLEASE look over the time it takes to get your first one in the mail.  Amazon states it takes 6 to 10 weeks from the day you purchase right at the top of the page.  All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and ""it's been a whole month!""  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.  EDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.

Both magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.  Both have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.  BusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called ""The Bottom Line"".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.  A big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).  The selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.

Takes about 2-3 months to get the first issue (which it clearly states when ordering).  There are some interesting articles, many intended for beginners.  Since the vast majority of yoga students are beginners, they are definitely hitting the target market.  But being a very advanced practitioner, I wasn't expecting too much from this magazine.  I was slightly surprised though from several of the peripheral articles.  That is, the articles not about the actual physical activity of yoga, but about the mind and lifestyle associated with.  Things like adding Feng Shui to your abode or tips for vacationing or improving wellness.  That is why I actually give it some good stars.  The one less star than perfect is because this magazine has TONS of ads.  Lots.  And many are for companies and products that many yoga students could care less about... Though some are of interest.  I don't mind some Lululemon and Gaiam ads, but flip through one issue and you see that nearly 2/3 of the magazine is ad space...  But I guess that's where the money is.  Not in the $5 to $15 per year subscriptions.  Also of note:  9 issues.  Not 12 for a year.  Just fyi.  If you know what you're getting with this periodical, then it's a good thing to have.  Just don't be shocked that the poses mentioned are pretty basic, or some of the fundamentals are covered over and over again.  It's meant for the beginner.

I don't have Cable or satelite TV so I very rarely get to sit and watch the food network, so I don't always know the cooks mentioned in this magazine. However, I love this magazine. The pictures are bright and colorful. The recipes are almost always easy to follow and generally don't require unusual ingredients. Every recipe I have tried to make out of this magazine has always turned out.

2093,2093,5,False,"04 27, 2014",A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B001LF4EVO,Robert I. Hedges,"""Food Network Magazine"" is my favorite culinary periodical. I am a fan of some of the celebrity chefs on Food Network, and this magazine is good on covering them in interviews and showcasing their recipes and cooking techniques. The magazine is very hefty and is printed on high quality glossy stock; that combined with the first class photography inside makes readers motivated to improve their cooking game and try their hand at new dishes and methods.  I'm a dedicated follower of Alton Brown, whose culinary creativity and methodologies are singularly amazing, and also love the food from Bobby Flay, Michael Symon, and Aarn Snchez (whose knowledge and use of spices and particularly peppers is without peer.) Honestly there are few of the chefs who I don't enjoy hearing from, and most issues are worth a solid cover to cover perusal. I like the visual elements of the magazine: the ""Recipe Index"" has a page number and photo of all the dishes in an issue, and the ""Star Search"" feature has pictures of the celebrities in an issue with the pages they appear on. There are many routine features that I love, but none as much as the well-illustrated recipes section. I particularly enjoy the ""You Asked"" section where the star chefs answer reader questions: sometimes these tips can prove extremely useful.  I gave the magazine five stars though there are a few things less than perfect. The magazine, like most similar publications, has a ton of advertising, though much of it is relevant and unobjectionable. Each issue has a theme: normally this theme is a welcome centering device, but sometimes it is excessive as are some of the features. A recent edition had more coverage of deviled eggs than anyone could ever want (and I like deviled eggs,) while some of the articles are of little practical use (I'm not interested in Penn Jillette's colorful kitchen, for instance, though I am sure some readers are.) Regardless of these quibbles, I still greatly enjoy ""Food Network Magazine"" and look forward to every new issue. I recommend it to cooks (of all experience levels) and fans of Food Network everywhere.",Makes Learning About Food Fun Again,1398556800,2.0,,,follower knowledge visual well-illustrated much excessive interview edition hand use star none alton cook enjoy advertising extremely feature like theme ever recommend index section could flay regardless try perfect search useful creativity symon perusal reader normally high favorite ton pepper many network hear anyone everywhere michael instance solid sure element cook brown amaze ask fan routine whose magazine interested less singularly publication star little food thing quibble combine page love celebrities new issue quality egg relevant answer technique snchez similar recent coverage method good bobby devil question worth hefty kitchen first chefs center number periodical want honestly aarn improve reader page particularly practical dish sometimes issue level motivate game fan also unobjectionable still recipe prove methodology welcome dedicate culinary inside photography five celebrity forward experience photo tip class glossy peer appear stock i'm article without cover look though device recipe make spice print greatly penn every colorful showcasing cover jillette's picture feature give

2099,2099,5,False,"11 10, 2010",A35W3JQYP0M655,B001LF4EVO,John Thomas,"I have been subscribing to The Food Network Magazine,(FNM) for almost a year now.  Down through the years I have subscribed to several cooking magazines, and for one reason or another have eventually let them drop.  Every one I know, or have subscribed too were bi monthly magazines that mostly contained some cute little departments in them that were fun to read, but mostly a whole lot of recipes.  True recipe magazines aren't a bad thing if you enjoy just holding something in your hand the old fashioned way, but if its really recipes only your after, the online world is absolutely infested with huge sites where that is all they have and do.  I just never felt I got enough beyond the recipes in the other magazines to ever make them worth keeping...  FNM is a whole different periodical.  Its more like a trade journal of the food network, and culinary industry in general.  All done in a nice easy, fun to read, colorful and entertaining style.  Its like being on the inside of the food channel, back stage where for most of us that love the food network, always wish we could be in any event.  I think its pretty much safe to say if you love the food network, or just love cooking, you will find this magazine immensely entertaining.  Its full of behind the scenes glimpses of the personalities, sets, production, and operation of all the shows we love to watch, as well as interviews, informative information, and a good dose of humor as well.  It also has a nice set up of every month departments where you can ask your questions, get reviews on new books and equipment, and get loads of tips on just about every kind if food or cooking that you can imagine.  Finally, despite what some other reviewers have expressed here as it being short on recipes, FCM still packs a good number of them into every issue, (even more starting about 7 issues ago). They also spread the recipes out as to dispensing them pretty evenly among all the different stars that have shows.  Therefore if you favor a certain personality or show, you will find something from them regularly.  Personally one thing I love about this magazine as to its take on recipes is that they don't seem to concentrate so much of sweets and desserts.  Seems like every magazine and cookbook I have ever owned deems is necessary to have a whole section devoted to just desserts.  I much prefer more in the way of recipes for real food, which FNM does a good job of delivering.  The recipes I have actually gotten around to trying from its pages have all turned out to be delicious, as you might expect.  Lastly there are two others things worth mentioning if your considering subscribing to this FNM, and doing it here on Amazon.  The first is that FNM is published 10 times a year, or 3 more times than all other cooking magazines I know.  I like the fact that it comes every month but two.  (And trust me, this is a slightly over size, thick magazine, not just a thin thumb through).  Finally, I originally subscribed to this magazine through one of those subscription service sites on the web that claims to always have the lowest prices around.  I paid $18 for my subscription, and as of this writing it is still going for that price online, while here on Amazon its currently $15.  A pretty good savings for what it is.  I not only highly recommend this fun entertaining and informative magazine, but I also recommend you buy it right here on Amazon. I certainly will be when my subscription renewal comes around. I am immensely enjoying my Food Network Magazine, and I really think you will like it too...",The Best Food Magazine..A Bargain,1289347200,,,,"know subscribed nice evenly express month reviewer sweets much interview personality hand find consider personality cook enjoy way event dispense price informative like ever dessert recommend fnm service thumb true prefer section could subscribe among actually might write world infest think spread others job time saving cute turn get delivering several network thing enough fashion dose expect claim eventually certainly magazine,(fnm take seem something journal slightly different real cookbook therefore magazine glimpse size subscription read low huge scene concentrate lastly fun stage little food safe star thing really thick keep set enjoy department one favor fact despite fcm love personally lot new issue back currently right whole pack let try beyond reason hold kind go own good renewal operation online question bi worth immensely amazon first come price trust load number periodical full almost certain thin watch magazine highly page get information publish mostly imagine issue buy bad general felt also ago production recipe still finally even humor necessary culinary inside easy book trade year drop delicious mention make show tip never short review gotten style around devote set two contained equipment old channel seem behind recipe entertain regularly ask originally monthly web pay well year always say site another industry do show every start colorful deems absolutely wish pretty"

I have been s subscriber for nearly 15 years and although I do not agree with many of their reviews, there is always something interesting to read in the magazine. The only thing that irks me a lot is their opinion that THE WALKING DEAD is the best TV show on the air since the invention of sliced bread. Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS.

It's a sort of a good mix of pop culture *plus* a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the *""interesting"" kind, meaning- you won't find out about Snooki's latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.  The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.  The only thing I don't like about the magazine is that it's starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there's a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I'm not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I'm not happy that now it's four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It's the same for books and television and other media, as well.  Regardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider ""necessary"".

Most of the recipes were kitchen friendly with ingredients and tools you would have in a decently stocked kitchen.  Something along the lines of smoked paprika might have been considered ""classy"" or even foreign.  Today, with Reader's Digest at the helm, it's a different magazine.  Gone are the days of no advertisements (subscriptions paid for the publishing and profit) and it is now filled with big glossy photos of food, kitchen and body related items that the publishers feel you cannot live without.  I, for one, can live without them.  Having spend more than 20 years in the culinary business from the bottom of the chain to operator and now educator, I would occasionally use Taste of Home for a ""comfort food selection"".  These particular recipes would be given to the newest of the new cooks to prepare and have ready for service.  Taste of Home still has decent recipes.

It was a magazine that captured the heart of North American cooks who submitted their tried-and-true recipes. Most, if not all, the recipes used ingredients found in most kitchen cupboards and were homey. The recipes were also easy to prepare.  Between the recipes was folksy blurbs telling about different cooks and their approach to cooking.  The magazine WAS a magazine that featured real home-style recipes.  The current magazine is none of the above. I purchased the November 2011 issue and expected to find some good home-style Thanksgiving recipes. Instead I found few recipes for the upcoming holiday and the ones I found would probably be more at home at a ""gourmet"" type magazine.  The Thanksgiving feature included the following recipes for the TOH menu:  Roasted Parsnip and Pear Soup Wilted Spinach Salad with Butternut Squash Cranberry Ricotta Gnocchi with Brown Butter Sauce Jalapeno Cranberry Sauce Tangerine-Glazed Turkey Spiced Pumpkin Custard Pie  While all the recipes are fine, my family would not be happy eating this for Thanksgiving as they are not all that traditional.  A typical Thanksgiving dinner for my family could include:  Relish Tray Roast Turkey and Dressing Mashed Potatoes Green Beans Cranberry Sauce Dinner Rolls Pumpkin Pie, Apple Pie, Cranberry Bread  Each year there may be a slight twists to the old favorites but the core ingredients remain the same.

This particular issue had an article on how big time companies were moving their ""headquarters"" overseas to avoid paying taxes.

With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.  What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don't mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.  Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because Im the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that its going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.  Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. Youre not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.  I usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read.
