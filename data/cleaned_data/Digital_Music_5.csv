The music to this song is as stunning as anything he's ever written. It opens with an Indian instrument called the gopichand (unknown to me) and it makes you do an about face. It's unsettling, just like its violent lyrics. Though ""The Werewolf"" (and most of the album) is percussive, when the pipe organ creeps in, the song's deathly feel is manifest.  In ""Street Angel"" and ""In a Parade"", Simon faces a social taboo with raw emotion. They're both subjects of the same homeless person. The fine melodies give service to their great rhythms. Again, percussion effects dominate here. With ""Street Angel"", the character has something to latch on to, but on ""In a Parade"" he checks into the ER with total absence of a vision. These two cuts could have made for one of the most tough-minded concept seven-inch singles.  The wonderful ""Cool Papa Bell"" is musically upbeat in the ""Graceland"" tradition of the fastest baseball player in the pre-Jackie Robinson era. The profanity in the song is subtly sung.  Simon still embraces his melodic folk roots. The two highlights are a sweet, brief instrumental entitled ""In the Garden of Edie"" , which is dedicated to his wife. The other is the closer, ""Insomniac's Lullaby"". This last song has two instruments I'd never heard of; the zoomoozophone and the chromelodeon. Maybe these instruments sound odd but every sound is layered oh so right. It's Simon's more halcyon death song than ""The Werewolf"".

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.  I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

Fisher,"This complete Ring cycle recorded in Czechoslovakia in 1968 by Austrian conductor Hans Swarowsky really has a lot going for it. I am giving it five stars for a few specific reasons -- especially the sound quality, a few individual performances, and my belief that you will have a hard time finding a Ring that sounds this good for the amazing price of $7.99.  First the positives, beyond the price. It sounds absolutely fantastic for an MP3. These are no LP transfers with record needle pops and crackles, it must be direct from the source tape or a quality remastering. It is an early, rich stereo recording, and according to what I have read, it was one of the first opera recordings where each singer got his or her own microphone. The text of the opera is therefore remarkably clear. This makes this recording a fantastic ""study"" version of the Ring, if you are interested in listening to the text and following along in the libretto. There are also some really great individual performances, especially Nadezda Kniplova as Brunnhilde and Rolf Polke as Wotan.  On the negative side, some vocal performances fall short of the best recordings of the Ring, and the orchestra is good but not always great (I heard what I felt was a clunker every now and again). Overall, this is a very good recording -- but if, say, the Solti Ring is 5 stars, then this one probably merits 3.5 or 4 as a performance. But don't get me wrong. The Solti Ring is hardly a fair comparison for most other recordings anyway.  On the technical side, bitrates are variable with averages in the 216-269 kbps range. Most tracks are in the 220s and 230s. Total download size is a whopping 1.52 GB for 14 hours and 48 minutes of music.  There are apparent mistakes on the MP3 files' metadata. It says the recordings are by the ""Grosses Symphonieorchster"". But as far as I know, Swarowsky recorded the Ring only once, and it was with the Czech Philharmonic and the Orchestra of the Prague National Theater. I am, of course, open to correction if anyone knows differently!  These performances hold their own admirably as a valid interpretation of the Ring, and you'll hardly find better-sounding MP3s. The price is also a valid consideration -- remarkable and welcome. Certainly worthwhile and recommended!","Good performances, great sound, outstanding bargain",1285286400,,fall know performance record hard negative vocal opera interpretation philharmonic find performance kniplova average recording microphone study kbps valid wotan rolf hour admirably download accord heard open remarkably hold conductor differently get crackle theater anyone certainly reason recommend direct great national symphonieorchster amaze minute better-sounding must therefore interested source size range czech read music swarowsky ring star record really technical stereo transfer course one orchestra lot quality wrong solti far beyond go sound good positive merit probably lp first libretto price singer hardly polke gross early version listening time find consideration austrian especially get fantastic whopping fair give gb prague track also felt complete anyway welcome five file sound rich side pop han text say short bitrates correction best overall czechoslovakia remastering recorded cycle along total mistake metadata know specific belief apparent needle make clunker comparison worthwhile remarkable individual always say variable brunnhilde every tape absolutely clear nadezda follow

This goes to show just how awesome the Empire series is. She does two songs for the show and both are nice. I bought Walk out on me because of its gritty Blues style. The song reminds me of Billie Holiday and so does the Elle Dallas character she plays on the show (Ive read that the Elle role was modeled after Whitney Houston, whose life was similar to Billies). The Elle character, Whitney and Billie typifies two of the many themes you see throughout the Empire series, the dual nature of dysfunction and collapse. Billie Holidays greatness came from the dysfunction of her experience just as Empire records and Elle Dallass greatness came from the dysfunction of their experience. This same dysfunction led to the collapse of Elle and Billies career and could lead to the collapse of Empire records. With Billies collapse there was death and with Elles there is rebirth.  The dual nature of dysfunction is becoming more evident in our everyday world now days.

We did think about combining both of these sets into one, but when we start to conceive boxes that are over 20 hours long...we think it's just too much at once. And at Amazon's great price, a second helping doesn't hurt too much. And time limits is what birthed this box - the Bach Guild/Vanguard catalog has a vast library of recordings of the standard repertoire - but not all of it fits neatly into the categories we've created over the past 18 months.  So the symphony stalwarts of classical music have been not included in our Big Bach Set. Without a composer-based theme, we're able to include some of the recordings not seen for decades, which is one of the most enjoyable reasons we release these boxes. In Volume 1 - we've covered works chronologically - we're bringing the Viennese connection to the front of the line. We've written about how early music and Vienna are intertwined in the history of Bach Guild, but the Vienna State Opera Orchestra paid the bills. For informational purposes, the Vienna State was simply the Vienna Philharmonic, minus the first chair players. In post-World War II Vienna, these musicians would work for pay, and work they did. Vanguard/Bach Guild made hundreds of records in about a decade, providing the catalog backbone of the label that eventually became more than just a classical music recording company. So the Vienna boys provided hours of repertoire - and we feature them in this box, providing Mozart's last two symphonies, a selection of Haydn's London symphonies, and making their digital debuts, Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 (From the New World) and Mendelssohn's last three symphonies. And one note about a perhaps long forgotten artist - Vladimir Golschmann.  On the wall of Seymour Solomon's home are two ads, both autographed, both featuring Vladimir Golschmann.  As conductor of the St. Louis Symphony, and a regular feature of New York recording sessions, he cut a figure that definitely impressed Madison Avenue. He was first featured in an ad for Calvert, holding a glass of ""The Aristocrat of Highballs"". And he was also ""The Man in the Arrow Shirt"". And a quick web search finds Arrow shirt ads, right next to reviews of his concerts.

Now, only a year later, Nine Inch Nails and their leader Trent Reznor, who for all intents and purposes is Nine Inch Nails, have returned with the nearly two hour ""Ghosts I-IV"", a set of atmospheric instrumentals. Now, if you would have told me even two years ago that the words ""prolific"" and ""Trent Reznor"" would ever, EVER be mentioned in the same sentence I would have laughed at you. But apparently after getting sober and getting the awfulness of ""With Teeth"" out of his system the man is just that. A total of thirty six tracks, ""Ghosts"" is as sprawling in ambition as ""The Fragile"", even without the accompaniment of vocals. In fact, this new, quicker working version of Trent Reznor works much better for the music than the one who would spend a good half a decade pain stakingly going over every note. Like ""Year Zero"" last year, there is an immediacy to ""Ghosts"" that previous NIN records lacked. Though the record is dense and layered, it is never overblown with needless tinkering and a million small little pops and bells and whistles that can be found on earlier NIN products. It's also nice to see Reznor in a true collaborative spirit, as ""Ghosts"" is co-written by Atticus Ross and Alessandro Cortino, NIN's current keyboard player. The difference in perspective helps give this record a feel different of any previous Nails album. And let's all be honest with each other: the weakest point to any Nine Inch Nails record has always been the lyrical skills of Reznor. Usually clumsy, occasionally inane, Reznor lets the music do the talking for him this time, which is a nice plus. So why only three stars for this record? Well, because at times ""Ghosts"" feels like a collection of ideas rather than songs. Though there is nothing awful on this record, there is also very little that is extraordinary, and it is too long for it's own good. The mood swings of the record are all complimented well, but too many song build and build and build and just stop, rather than fully taking off and entering someplace different and more interesting. In fact, the best place to listen to ""Ghosts"" is probably in your car, late at night, driving home, where it can sink into your head but you're never really paying close attention to it. But ""Ghosts"" is worth the purchase for sure. It's price, and the quality of good, if rarely great, music, and the fact that after almost twenty years Trent Reznor actually sounds like he's enjoying the process of making music. Hopefully this is a series that he will continue to work on for many years to come.",Ghosts,1208908800,,player give he's trent product nice mood laugh much nin's apparently keyboard head decade work record nails someplace sprawl like drive purchase ever quick vocal true tinker extraordinary cortino spirit song come half take usually actually let six time listen night last nothing twenty high songwritting ghost many inch sure great thirty make prolific feel different teeth later atmospheric ross feel alessandro song rarely pain stop well artistic long find music earlier inane interest nearly little stars sharp fragile idea record really enjoy one fact occasionally needless series atticus new fracture bounce return back quality place high point perspective lyrical ambition accompaniment help mention believe go sound good home hopefully probably worth talk collection let's hour price skill almost fully version zero time collaborative album co-written would spend overblown nine track swing ago also close pay production nin whistle honest work clumsy even see attention sink immediacy purpose year man million current dense leader instrumentals pop plus never build enter sentence compliment process reznor car continue word set best two work intent i-iv stakingly total without previous system though layered lack sober feature bell well year weak always tell get note difference decay three every awful awfulness late small rather

That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!!

I commented sceptically on the enthusiastic welcome given this disc by another fellow reviewer , the Santa Fe Listener, but am again ready to recant and say that five years later I am convinced that Grigolo is managing his vocal and career development very wisely. Perhaps the continued dearth of really Italianate tenors has made me more susceptible to his gifts but I am now genuinely enthused about his ability to carry the torch.  The best things about his voice apart from its intrinsic beauty are his evenness of production, the way in which he inflects the music with musically acute details and the clarity of his diction. He has studied and acquired all the little vocal refinements which allow a singer to inject the note with emotion without being too overt about it; hence he has mastered the judicious use of portamento,  the acciaccatura, the messa di voce and the despatch of fioratura - all of which may be heard to perfection in the best track here from the same role in which I have just heard him live, ""Una furtiva lagrima"".  I was surprised that he opes this recital with an aria from a heavier, spinto tenor role but he manages it without strain and even returns to a second aria from ""Un ballo in maschera""sings in track11. He does not here yet have quite the full weight of voice to do it full justice but his attention to colouring the text is exemplary. The programme includes several weightier arias alongside some standard bel canto numbers;hence early and middle period Verdi features, as does some heftier Puccini, as an indication of the direction he has gradually been taking since. In fact, there are only two Donizetti arias here;the rest are all from those two other composers.  While his voice does not have the distinctive ping of the young Pavarotti, he sounds far more pharyngeal and virile than Bocelli - and I like his chutzpah in throwing in a high C sharp at the end of the aria from ""Il corsaro"". I look forward to bigger and better - but all in good time as he is still three years off forty as I write.

The first DVD-A contains the new stereo mix of the four original album tracks plus the extended ""Dance Of The Dawn"" in High Definition. The second DVD-A contains the same mixed for 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Sound, along with a flat transfer of the original album from the master tape source. The Blu-Ray disc retains the content of both DVD-As along with a plethora of extras, including the ""alternate"" album version, the five single edits, new stereo instrumental mixes of the album tracks and extended ""Dance Of The Dawn"" in DTS-HD Master Audio, and two ""needle-drop"" vinyl transfers; from the original UK LP pressing and the US banded promo LP pressing. Whew...!  TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, the group's sixth studio album, is considered by many the most controversial of the YES canon. Coming off the mega-selling CLOSE TO THE EDGE (#3US, #4UK), which featured just three tracks, including the side-long title cut, the band was blindsided by the departure of drummer Bill Bruford. Although an extremely gifted and popular member, Bruford was tired of the personal conflicts and the constant state of friction between him, singer Jon Anderson and bassist Chris Squire. When scouted by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KING-CRIMSON/dp/B00065MDSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KING CRIMSON</a>&nbsp;honcho Robert Fripp, who was putting together a new version of the titular groundbreaking progressive group, Bruford quickly bailed. With a world tour on the horizon, the band settled on Alan White, mostly known for his work with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLASTIC-ONO-BAND/dp/B000002UT9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLASTIC ONO BAND</a>&nbsp;and on John Lennon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IMAGINE/dp/B003Y8YXFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IMAGINE</a>, who had three-days to rehearse (!) before the tour commenced (most of the content of the band's next release, the live&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YESSONGS/dp/B000002J1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YESSONGS</a>&nbsp;were recorded on said tour). During a stop in Tokyo during the tour, Jon Anderson was inspired to write a four-part epic based on a lengthy footnote within the book '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autobiography-Of-A-Yogi/dp/0876120796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autobiography Of A Yogi</a>' that described four ""shastras"" or treatises covering all aspects of religious and social life. Anderson approach guitarist Steve Howe with his idea, and when Howe agreed they began working on themes and instrumentation, conceiving the project as four side-long album tracks. Unfortunately keyboardist Rick Wakeman disagreed with the concept and musical direction, but agreed to finish the material, even though he considered it too avant-garde, bloated and padded. The songs were credited to Anderson and Howe, with music by YES. TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS  was the first YES album to utilize 24-track recording, although they had numerous issues with the equipment. Wakeman found himself often bored and spent a lot of time in a nearby pub playing darts. He also contributed to BLACK SABBATH's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SABBATH-BLOODY-SABBATH/dp/B000002KET/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH</a>&nbsp;which was being recorded in an adjacent studio. A tour followed where the group performed the entire album live, which I'm proud to say I caught twice. Afterwards, Wakeman was the next to jump ship, onto a fairly successful solo career, rejoining YES on and off throughout the remaining years. Although panned by many critics, who held the album as an example of progressive-rock excess, it was a stunning commercial success. It was the first UK album to ""ship gold,"" and topped their charts for two weeks, in the US it made #6 and also certified gold (over 500,000 copies sold). The band toured behind the album from November 1973 to April 1974. The band also broke attendance records at the UK's Rainbow Theatre, selling out five consecutive nights, a rock band first.....  The set comes in two mini vinyl replica gatefold sleeves within a slipcase, at first the cover art looks the same on both, but on closer inspection the second has a subtle difference (I'll leave it for you to discover). The disc labels reproduce the record labels found in the original 2LP set, in both the original (Discs 1 & 2) and ""tweaked"" (Discs 3 & 4) versions. The booklet features new sleeve notes by Sid Smith along with portions of new interviews with Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Alan White.  Besides rare photos and archive material the original artwork has been expanded, restored and approved by long-time YES illustrator Roger Dean. My only complaint is the lack of easily readable lyrics. Either an expanded booklet, a separate lyric booklet, or a mini-poster of the original (and beautiful) inner jacket is sorely needed.  As is you need a magnifying glass or your old LP to follow the lyrics, which are a major part of this masterwork, and enjoy the now minuscule inner artwork........  To quote Steven Wilson: ""I worked on and off for about 3 years on this new mix in my quest to do it justice. I hope it will satisfy the people who agree with me that it may just be Yes's pre-eminent masterpiece.""  As with RELAYER, another dense recording, the added surround, center and subwoofer channels open the compositions wider, helping the listener to discern parts and themes buried in the conventional two-channel mix-down. I wish they had included a surround version of the instrumental mixes found on the Blu-ray, although the listener can again discern more from the absence of vocals, a 5.1 mix would've been the icing on an already delicious platter. Mirroring their genesis, all the tracks are credited lyrically to Anderson/Howe, adding Squire to ""The Ancient / Giants Under The Sun."" The music is credited to the entire band as well as the track ""The Remembering / High The Memory."" Anderson and Howe felt TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS to be innovative and breaking new ground, whereas the critics let loose, some calling it the death-knell of progressive rock. . It's arguable that the architect of the album's sound-palate this go-round is Howe, who's playing throughout is stellar. Even though he has spoken bout his distaste of the opus, Rick Wakeman devised many unique and daring keyboard passages, providing the ""glue"" so to say, that binds of the disparate parts. One of the pluses of Steven Wilson's remix is the liberation of Chris Squire's bass, which seemed lost most of the time in the original mix. Surprisingly the MVP award goes to the new kid, drummer Alan White. To be thrown into the maelstrom of a mega-popular band's tour on three days notice while facing the prospect of contributing and recording four side-long compositions must've seemed daunting indeed! White not only acquits himself with a rock-solid steady base underlying the music, he also contributed melodies, a bridge and piano on ""Ritual."" His finest moment however is leading the band during the astounding ""Ritual"" percussion break, the rarest of rock animals, a drum/percussion solo that's not boring. The two outtakes of ""Dance Of The Dawn,"" basically live in the studio run-throughs, are terrific as well, and best exemplify the talent, genius and innate musicality of the band called YES......  All said, the remastering is stellar, the remix will depend on individual tastes. As with his remix of RELAYER, Wilson brings forth many passages, sounds and nuances buried in the original mix. Is it better? Well, while the 2003 Rhino remaster was great, hearing this prog monster in surround sound is a whole other ballgame. Wilson's remixes/re-imaginings are always well done, you never sit there and think ""gee, this sounds lousy"" unless your a dyed-in-the-original-listened-to-it-2,000-times advocate for the original recording, which is also here as a ""flat transfer from the original tape source"" as well as needle-drops from the original UK LP and US Promo LP (the latter two Blu-Ray only).  I look on these YES remixes as a complimentary additions to the original recordings. Considering the length of TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS and the breadth of extra material you would have to spend many, many hours listening to and comparing the different versions to note the exact differences. I say, take it on it's own merits, and enjoy! Fans will definitely be pleased, and those either new to the album or critical in the past will have to judge it's merits. Me? Well anyone who has read my review of FRAGILE will note that I was disappointed that TALES was not the next release after RELAYER. You'll have to excuse me, I'm dying for a second/third/fourth listen......  TRACK LIST: New Stereo Mixes: CD 1: 1. The Revealing Science Of God (Dance Of The Dawn) 20:18 2.

After testing the waters with a 2009 reunion Faith No More finally have delivered a new studio album. New material from reformed acts can be a dangerous thing. Often adding nothing to earlier work and end up usually feeling out of place when put next to earlier work, thankfully no such problems with Sol Invictus which from start to finish is a fine album.  From the laid back, moody opener of the title track Sol Invictus to album closer From The Dead Faith No More demonstrate that they still have a lot to offer in 2015 and at a time when rock is supposedly dead Faith No More prove that it is only dead to those who don't know where to look. The early signs were good with the Black Friday release of MotherF*****r which sounded like a different version of Tomahawks I.O.U to the second single the driving Superhero which was a straight up throw back to Faith No More KFAD 1994 era.  Bassist Billy Gould really shines this album with his bass driving a number of tracks such as Separation Anxiety and album stand-out Matador. If this album had been released in 1999 or early 2000 it would have been the album that the current line up of the band would have made, that fact that it came in 2015 does not distract.  Make no mistake this is a great Faith No More album, Tomahawk fans will notice similarities (in particular Cone of Shame & Motherf*****r) between that bands past release and this. That is to be expected as Patton has released 4 albums with them.

If the new songs sounded too much like Doolittle or Surfa Rosa, people would be saying they are just resting on their laurels and reliving their past (albeit without the inimitable and sublime Kim Deal).  if the music deviated too much from the classic Pixies sound (and chord structures, let's face it---some of their songs are similar), then people would be asking why this isn't just another Frank Black solo album.  I think they find a pretty healthy medium here---there are at least a few songs here that absolutely stand up next to anything on Doolittle (I love Greens and Blues, Indie Cindy, Ring the Bell, and Magdalene 318, for starters).  There are a few songs which are just so-so, but really not a lot of those (the hit-to-miss ratio is pretty good for a 12-song album).  Yes, like many others I miss Kim's bass work and awesome background vocal work, but Black Francis's vocals are great on here and nearly make up for that, and Joey Santiago's guitar work to me is almost as integral to their sound as Black Francis---his crazy solos and surf-punk stylings sound awesome on here.

But I think Rush's The Spirit of Radio is the best of the bunch. The guitar riff is like my dog suddenly jumping on me in the morning, wake up and play and be happy! A big slobbery kiss at 0:04, I try to roll over but she just jumps over to that side as well, bounding all about. Finally at 0:17 I have surrendered to her will and I am up. Look out the window, turn on the coffee, eat some breakfast, get dressed, grab the leash and treats and baggies, and then at 0:42 we hit the open road for a walk.  Begin the day with a friendly voice, a companion unobtrusive...well, I can't continue with the dog analogy because at 5 in the morning her voice is loud and obnoxious, and when we are out walking in the neighborhood she can occasionally be quite obtrusive. However, she is a very friendly companion.  The Spirit of Radio is about...drum roll...radio! The joy and beauty of music coming through the speakers, dancing around you on the airwaves, undemanding contact in your happy solitude. At 1:24, bass drum pounds and the first guitar riff returns, and another lyrical section about...the radio! Isn't it amazing! A gift beyond price. We can't see the airwaves, but we pick up on the sounds entering our ears, our bright antennae bristle with the energy, and the translation through our minds produces emotional feedback.  Of course, although one likes to believe in the freedom of music, radio is a business, and there are glittering prizes and endless compromises going on behind the scenes that shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah.  Check out that tumbling down moment at 3:36, it's the exasperation of dealing with the radio executive, the schmoozing DJ, the Biz. But Rush pick themselves up for an introspective moment: For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall. They record the music and radio helps sell their albums, and the band members makes their livings this way, so buck up and deal with it. Did they think adding a reggae groove would help? Well, it didn't. This whole discussion of radio has made them bitter and reflective, so they decide to release their emotions with a sizzling guitar solo that extends out into their listeners' brains and by the end everyone is happy. And now, a thousand words from our sponsors, followed by a 90 minute classic rock music marathon, and we will only play songs you've already heard a zillion times because if you hear anything unfamiliar it might be considered obtrusive and we'd get in trouble with the FCC.",SEP 17,1497225600,,about...drum profit face treat member produce reggae contact like compromise joy mind radio jump rock quite bright yeah return exasperation buck dress antenna about...the way speaker ears like however pop's section glitter spirit baggies freedom living song heard might try think emotion open jump walk dance time everyone dj can't get obnoxious fcc bristle suddenly executive extends pick bitter big roll sizzle drum already trouble sell amaze begin bass groove solitude pound deal happy breakfast although zillion music scene marathon eat friendly obtrusive write record consider course occasionally one play introspective business wall unfamiliar turn deal morning make walk whole iggy lyrical shatter illusion sponsor beyond help follow believe go loud sound add reflective leash energy first listener price rush's minute studio help riff would dog rush brain gift check hear integrity unobtrusive...well translation we'd finally voice see tumble lust hit band discussion solo slobbery grab day feedback prize release springsteen's guitar road side roll...radio companion album bear enter moment window continue airwave around word best endless classic intro beauty neighborhood kiss come look life run emotional thousand behind bunch end make wake stay bound analogy well decide undemanding another biz schmooze anything bruce exhilarate surrender coffee

After all, they've given us so many great collections by now that it's hard to keep track of them all. I don't know how many they've released altogether, and I sure don't have all of them myself, but I did find (somewhat to my surprise) that I've managed to accumulate 26 of them (now 27 with this addition), totaling almost 210 hours of music! That is remarkable, not only for the quantity of music but most notably for the bargains these sets have provided.  And here we have the latest, this time bringing together 16 violin concertos from 14 different composers (Mozart given extra representation with three of his violin concertos). And as we've come to expect, very capable performances throughout. The two concerto performances by David Oistrakh and with Kiril Kondrashin conducting the State Orchestra of U.S.S.R are historic recordings dating from the late 1940's but presented here in very acceptable sound quality. Joseph Silverstein's recordings of the violin concertos of Mendelssohn, Mozart, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky are notable, as are the performances by Misha Elman with Vladimir Golschmann conducting, giving us concertos by Lalo, Saint-Sans, Bach, Nardini and Vivaldi. Contrast those historic performances with the Bruch concerto and Scottish Fantasy performed by the Japanese violinist Yuzuko Horigome  There is some overlap with the Bach Guilds earlier 'Big Violin Box' and 'Big Baroque Box Vol III' (see notes below) so for those who have already acquired that set this is a point to be aware of. Still, for 99 cents a bit of duplication is not objectionable.  Also note that track information provided by Bach Guild either here on Amazon or on their own website may not always be correct - see corrections below.

After endless touring, the guys finally have recorded a new album. After a first single in September (""Shut Up and Dance""), now comes the second single, just weeks ahead of the new album's release.  ""Different Colors"" (3'17"") is the sophomore single of the upcoming album, and this is pure 'classic' WTM sound. The band sounds like they're having fun, and the song makes you want to get up and sing along, in particular when the chorus comes on: ""Say uh uh uh uh/Different colors/Uh uh uh uh/We paint each other"", ha! Who even would want to resist that? Note: the body-painting theme, so prominent in the band's early days, seems to have returned (at least in the lyrics). Bottom line: this seems to indicate more fun times are coming our way on WTM's upcoming second album for RCA, ""Talking Is Hard"", which is due for release in early December..  You haven't had the full experience of Walk the Moon if you haven't seen them in concert. Being in Cincinnati, I've seen them plenty of times over the years. Most recently, they played here in August on the ""Gospel"" tour along with Panic! At the Disco, and they blew up the roof, once again.

Kim,"It's obvious I don't have to say that Nirvana literally changed rock music in the 90's, because EVERYONE knows that did. GO ahead and dislike them if you like, but these three men created a fresh, bold new sound back in 1991. Nevermind and In Utero are the albums that put alternative rock into the mainsteam (thus we now have Grunge, Alternative Metal, Post-Grunge, etc.). Sure, I like Korn and Staind and such, but I always know that Nirvana is the one that gave them a bit of influence, at least.  Here in Nevermind, it's all so engaging. Everyone knows ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" and that it's an excellent (but maybe overrated) song, so I'm not going into detail here. ""Lithium"" and ""In Bloom"" are two of my favorites: both have that energetic and lyrical feel that's found in many later singles in the 90's. ""Come as You Are"" is as haunting as ""Heart Shaped Box"" in In Utero. ""Polly"" is an acoustic song that dwelves away from the hard-rocking energy that's constant throughout the album. ""Territorial Pissings"" is so intense that I worry that my neighbors would complain when I play it in a loud volume. Finally, ""Something in the Way"" is a stunning conclusion to the album: soft, eerie, melodic, and beautiful at the same time.  Personally, my favorite song from Nirvana is ""Heart Shaped Box"" from ""In Utero"", but the songs here will always be memorable not only to me, but to a vast majority of the human race.

Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.  Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.  ""And I need you now tonight And I need you more than ever And if you'll only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever And we'll only be making it right 'Cause we'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks I really need you tonight Forever's gonna start tonight Forever's gonna start tonight  Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I'm only falling apart Nothing I can do A total eclipse of the heart Once upon a time there was light in my life But now there's only love in the dark Nothing I can say A total eclipse of the heart""",John du Prey - Classical Review,1332979200,,know ballad howl power soul crescendo written/produced melancholia valhalla passive romance romantic like reasonable order bonnie men ever vocal jim shadow powerful proclaim heard swim need world spark viking hold apart tight fall nothing nature high dark within keg frustration take echo sung great commanded eclipse make we're gonna song state whose correctly less saddened burn rise pagan line forever's really steinman upon one love shout agitate acclaim right epic norse wrong emotive beyond we'll bleach followed suffice replay hold forever sing eric tonight backup together truly singer heighten light across alone remain time soak perhaps hopefully afternoon exquisite heart particular living woman's women-warriors give wave civil magnificent vocalist powder brilliant start hurt decrescendo siren tidal remove voice tumultuous gathering doldrums adam release experience case never ethereal presence heaven i'm around torch becomes classic troyer total complacent life content throughout welsh end distinctly there's torture fjord tyler famous assume cause dodd always say heart's gift rory every land carry moonface give expectation praise rather bryan give

Going back to 2010 when Stevie was working on her ""In Your Dreams"" album she discovered one her lost demos, ""Secret Love"", on YouTube. She reworked that track for that album. Jump ahead a few years and she discovered lots more of her lost demos on YouTube and with a few weeks this past spring, she and producer Dave Stewart headed down to Nashville to rework these tracks.  As a long time fan, I've had these demos in my collection for years, when I heard what her plan was, I was skeptical. This isn't the first time she's reworked old demos, but the results haven't always been great. Listen to her original demo for ""Smile At You"", then check out the watered down released version on Fleetwood Mac's ""Say You Will"". Would she be able to recapture the magic in these original demos, or would the suffer the same fate of ""Smile At You"" where too much time has passed and the inspiration behind the song is long forgotten. Another concern was her voice, it's aged a lot since the recording of the demos. The answer is not only do these songs come to life, but in nearly every case, outshine the demos.   Among the highlights, the album kicks off with ""Starshine"", this is a fun rocker that is a great album opener and would also be a killer opening song on stage. If you're familiar with the demo, you'll hear how she really recaptured the feel of 1980 and the recording of the ""Bella Donna"" album right down to the organ solo.  ""Mabel Normand"" is one of her more rare demos, the song tells the tale of the long forgotten actress but here Stevie compares her own life to that of Mabel. The song dates back to the ""Rock A Little"" era and like ""Thousand Days"" or ""Mirror Mirror"" it has an almost rambling feel to the lyric, that's not a bad thing.  The album's title ""24 Karat Gold"" was a demo that I could never quite get into, the version here though shines. From the opening lone bass riff, which rolls into a drum beat, the song just comes to life.  One of my favorites from the album, ""Belle Fleur"" is another of the demos that I never got into, but once again, Stevie has transformed the song into a gem. The first minute of the song here is just a chugging drum beat that hooks you just before the song has it's proper start. I also like the banjo heard throughout the song.  ""All The Beautiful Worlds"" is a great song period. It's got a haunting tone that has a very definite late 70's/early 80's feel to it. Again here Stevie's vocals sound as strong and vibrant as they did in the 80's. With Sharon and Lori providing their background vocals, the song is classic Stevie.  ""Lady"" was known for years among fans as ""Knocking On Doors"". Stevie wrote this back in the late 60's when she and Lindsey were trying to get noticed. Her voice has aged to perfection here. Just Stevie and a piano, that's all this song needs.  With ""I Don't Care"" Stevie rocks out. The music track was written by Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell and Waddy Wachtel. It's got a swampy bluesy feel, a very different sound for Stevie. Stevie has said the end of the song lyrically was made up on the spot, honestly the whole song lyrically sounds improvised, but it works.  ""Watch Chain"" written about Mick Fleetwood in the late 70's has retained much of the feel of the original demo. I've always liked this one and yet again, Stevie's vocals have somehow transported back to the 70's.  ""Hard Advice"" is the sister song to 2001's ""That Made Me Stronger"", two songs written about the same conversation. In this case a conversation Stevie had with Tom Petty. This is a beautiful track.  ""Carousel"" is a Vanessa Carlton song that Stevie did not write, however it's included here because it was one of Stevie's late mother's favorites.  ""Blue Water"" is something of holy grail song among fans, written by Stevie with Sharon Celani back in the late 70's. I never cared for the demo, but once again the song has come alive here. She's helped out on this one with Lady Antebellum.  ""Cathouse Blues"" was always something of a oddball among Stevie's demos. As with ""I Don't Care"" Stevie musically is trading new ground here, the song is given a jazzy treatment along with dixieland horns. Yes, it works.  ""The Dealer"" has long been one of my favorites, one can assume it was one of Stevie's favorites as well, as she has recorded several demos of this. This version is slowed down a bit from the 1970's demo, and some of the excitement from the original demo is missing. However if you've never heard the demo, then there is much to like here.  Closing out the album is ""She Loves Him Still"", another track she's attempted a few times. Some don't like the woodwind on this, I think it fits the song. Years have passed since she wrote this and she has moved on from whatever inspired her, but yet she sings it as if it was inspired just yesterday.   Stevie said recently that she couldn't write these songs today. She's right, she's moved on and grown since these songs were written, in some ways these are really very simple songs. In every way though these are classic Stevie songs. This is very much the most pure Stevie album we've ever gotten.  Many of these songs probably wouldn't have been hits during the time they were written and that's probably why they were left behind. Looking back on these songs now, the heartbreak that inspired them has healed and now the songs are allowed to shine.  In some ways this doesn't feel like a new album at all, it seems almost like a greatest hits album. At the same time it IS a new album filled with classic Stevie moments.",The Long Lost Stevie Album That Never Was,1412467200,,grail carousel i've newly lori yesterday ever treatment say heard lindsey belle time rocker dealer get forget lyrically many thing open oddball different song age fun stage jazzy write mabel really write inspiration beat original right holy waddy try vanessa yes album's recapture smile rock spring bit almost version would fit write hear excitement familiar track bad ahead work jump karat water easily water sound demo release shine antebellum definite door dave two record opener thousand petty killer fleur provide woodwind every actress compare hook know transform hard concern much rock like vocal transport improvised way could come shine slow listen title swampy bella sings mirror several today ramble mother's well long mick one grow love new dixieland whatever make whole haunting day pass first time sharon alive demo also still vault voice vibrant proper stevie's organ solo trading year lone case head need celani since stevie classic yet old wachtel attempt though behind tone fill always notice give lyric carlton record spot gold heartbreak close magic week world retain however piano song among known knock think lot we've tell secret conversation seem mac's bass fan advice fate sister music leave nearly little help like lot back discover outshine kick producer highlight beautiful favorite able stewart allow come fleetwood honestly watch get date background check starshine somehow start period plan recapture blue recently gem work along life throughout assume well say another strong skeptical look lady care track heal hit quite way move result banjo moment chug strong something great drum simple roll feel campbell great that's include rare miss pure care answer guitarist bluesy cathouse go sound lose youtube probably collection nick minute love album riff dream blue fan tom ground horn musically rework donna perfection never tale gotten mike nashville rework end inspire suffer past late normand era chain

It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of ""Live @ the Fillmore"" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, ""Everything Has Changed.""  I preordered Lucinda's ""West"" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, ""Are you alight?""  When people ask me that, I want to say, ""He*l no!""  But when she sings, ""All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,"" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, ""Just tell me that you're okay.""  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.  ""Unsuffer Me"" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  ""Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,"" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, ""It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.""  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.  Other cuts are also amazing.  ""Learning How to Live"" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  ""Fancy Funeral"" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in ""Come On"" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, ""Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.""  ""Words"" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.  Yes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from ""Happy Woman Blues"" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.  ""West"" takes a well deserved place at the table as one of her most compelling, moving works.

But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's ""Fall For You.""

We know, were now applying the Bach Guild brand to a series of recordings that never were released under The Bach Guild imprint, which is a first for us. However, this music spotlights another role that independent labels played in the latter part of the 20th century. Seymour Solomon (as we have mentioned endlessly) began The Bach Guild as an attempt to record all of Bachs cantatas, stating that at the time he started there were 1 and  Bach cantatas listed in the Schwann Guide to Recordings. Outside the Bach Guild imprint, Seymour and his brother Maynard explored other areas of untapped repertoire. Vanguard was created as a sister label to run alongside The Bach Guild to expand beyond Bach  first into classical, then quickly into jazz and folk music. And there we begin the Jewish music journey. The Solomon brothers created many very fine recordings celebrating Hebrew, Yiddish and Jewish culture. They looked backwards to the music of the lands where the immigrants came, and also into their current times, recording songs and works of Jewish composers like Bloch and Copland. Sadly, due to copyright restrictions, many of those fine recordings are excluded on this new box, but we have a well-stocked collection, one that is almost completely new for digital release. The music we have presented here is mainly taken from celebratory collection  and filled with goodies. Among the crown jewels of this collection are two Jewish folk song albums featuring Martha Schlamme. We released her practically unknown Christmas album two years ago, now we finally get into the 2nd Avenue spirit, and present the two albums she made for Vanguard in the early 1960s. Also available for the first time are the Yiddish and Hebrew folksong recordings of Netania Davrath. Robert deCormier and his orchestra play a large role, as he did a large number of arrangements for these folk song albums, and they are arrangements strongly in the 1950s movie soundtrack tradition  perhaps a bit heavier than todays tastes, but brimming with imagination and power. Same to be said for his orchestral recordings  and those of the Karmon Israeli Dancers and Orchestra. Theres not much intimate, reflective music here in this collection, and certainly not on these orchestral recordings. Jan Peerce made several recordings for Vanguard, and here he performs a seder  so please be warned, there is spoken word included in this collection. In the post-Vanguard Omega catalog we discovered some superb klezmer, and weve included that as well. But now a moment to consider what we weren't able to put inthis is one of the few Big Boxes where there was a tremdendous amount of material that we couldn't include, due to mechanical copyright restrictions (we don't sell any copyrighted music  or else we couldn't sell these boxes for .99). Obvious omissions include (or exclude, really) Mischa Elmans fine Hebrew Melodies album, Herschel Bernardis live cabaret act, and the excellent Jewish Music in America recital with bass Leon Lishner.

As one of the bands finest and most   beloved masterworks, Muswell Hillbillies was greeted with critical acclaim but started   out as a fair accomplishment on the charts upon its official release, then its success   soon caught on.

""Black and Blue"" was a transitional record for the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. Mick Taylor, widely considered their best ever guitarist and a driving force behind their peak creative period, had left the band shortly after recording ""It's Only Rock 'n' Roll"" in 1974, and the next few months were spent searching for a new guitarist to fill what was a major musical void for the group. Candidates included Harvey Mandel (who actually plays on several tracks on ""B&B"") and even Eric Clapton, but the role wound up going to former Faces member Ron Wood, who joined the band in time for their 1975 tour.  ""Black and Blue"" is one of their most experimental records as well, though that's not necessarily for the better in some cases. Funk and reggae were becoming major movements at the time, and Mick was especially swept up in it. Several of the album's tracks boast his fixation with the genres, but they unfortunately drag the album down in most instances. The opening number ""Hot Stuff,"" is built around a pleasant enough riff by Mandel and has a pretty catchy rhythm including some fine piano work, but lyrically it's the same chorus repeated over and over again followed by a sequence of Mick spouting out Jaggerisms in an embarassing faux Jamaican accent. This schtick is revisiting a few times throughout the record, most noticably the dreadful ""Cherry Oh Baby"" and the odd reggae / punk hybrid ""Hey Negrita.""  The album's better tracks are worthy of recognition. ""Hand of Fate"" is a solid, gritty Stones rocker, as well as the most genuinely traditional Stones sounding track on the entire album. Mick delivers a punchy vocal and the band is well oiled and rocking. ""Memory Motel"" and the hit single ""Fool to Cry"" are both uncharacteristic, keyboard drenched power ballads that work better than they should considering their sappiness; the former has some great contributions from Keith on the bridge while the latter has Mick making great use of his falsetto. Finally, ""Melody"" is a playful, jazz infused number reminiscent of the previous album's ""Short and Curly.""

Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a splendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot. His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60's, 70's and 80's. Yes, Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original.  During the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit ""Fingertips - Pt 2"" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! ""Little Stevie Wonder"" was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. During the 1960's Wonder would go on to have nearly two dozen charted singles including the rollicking ""I Was Made To Love Her"", ""Uptight (Everything's Alright)"" and the beautiful love song ""My Cherie Amour"" in 1969.  For all of the success he enjoyed in the 1960's Stevie Wonder would go on to even bigger and better things during the 1970's.  Stevie was definitely on a roll and five of his singles would make all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  In the fall of 1976 Stevie Wonder released his masterpiece, the 2 LP set ""Songs In The Key Of Life"".  The album was an immediate smash debuting at #1 the week of October 16, 1976. It spent 14 weeks at the top of the charts and an impressive 35 weeks in the Top Ten.  The project yielded a total of 4 Top 40 singles two of which went all the way to #1.  As far as I am concerned ""I Wish"" is one of the two or three best singles Stevie Wonder ever released.  The tune earned Stevie a Grammy for the Best R&B Male Vocal performance of 1976.

Bilby,"Kate Pierson has finally released her own solo cd after being in one of the best out there party bands over the past 35 years, The B'52s and I'm loving this music. To describe what this collection is all about, well it certainly not a paint by numbers pop album.  Its so full of energy, a cosmic connection , its one of the biggest surprises I've listened to in a long time. Unconventional, wordy, arty, a vocal singing celebration that just had to come out.  Harmony's and melodies and choruses bust out everywhere  I'd heard a few cuts released over the past month or so, I knew this was gonna be special, but as a whole, this is neat little pop gem exe produced by Sia and there is wonderful touches and sounds throughout, never over produced, love the electronica splashes everywhere, sure a little B-52s dance pulses in there as well but man this is burst of non stop energy, people of all ages need to hear this. My favorites on Guitars & Microphones.. the title cut is a blast of Kate's imagination and her own world she's grown up in, great song, would make a great video & radio track,  ""Throw down the roses"" starts it off and is another gem of words and music that's pure female empowerment, a highlight track... ""Time wave Zero"", end of days comes for us, and the solar system is imploding but hold on to the one you love and go out dancing! This is such a highlight of music and sounds, ""Matrix"" is another gem with a spacey vibe and awesome wordplay and music jam that never quits. ""Bottoms Up"" gives a nice slice of alt/rock to mix up the styles on this cd, using Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi and Kate knows how to find the talents to surround herself with. ""Bring your arms"" finds Kate dealing with the issues of saving baby turtles with the talents of Sia's writing  and productions skills and Kate's trippy/ hippy love shines through on this one. ""Crush me with your love"" and ""Wolves"", dealing with some personal issues of love and happiness that wouldn't have worked as well on a B-52s collection but on this solo collection, they standout,  again mixing up the styles makes ""GUITARS AND MICROPHONES"" stand out with repeated listens.  The first single I heard from ""Guitars and Microphones"", ""Mister Sister"" is a controversial song that took some heat from the transgender communities but it fits into this collection, ""debbie delicious"", whatever? Its a clever song about looking in the mirror and change in a positive way.  Guitars and Microphones ends with ""Pulls you under"", a heartfelt torch  stunner, Kate still has such a bright, powerful voice that's full of the most colorful wordplay, This is a fun record to pick up, once you give it a few listens, your hooked!  Kate Pierson and company must be so proud of this one. Love the bright colorful cd cover by Monica Coleman, Kate's partner and responsible for the big push that got this all made. Don't forget to check out the words to these songs, though the songs breeze like a runaway train,  there is much to think about between the lines, ""Bottoms Up"" speaks of drug addiction and the closer ""Pulls you under"" is a heartbreaking look at death and letting go, can't say enough about this awesome collection of tunes, just buy it!",...

1297,64392,4,,False,"08 15, 2010",A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B003BSCYYI,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Andre S. Grindle,"It's been about five years since Monica last bought us any new music with her previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Makings-Of-Me/dp/B000HA4WES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Makings Of Me</a>&nbsp;and no matter how you cut it the period about five years before that proved the turn of the millenium just wasn't her decade personally. Well she found a new love in her life and has taken some time off to raise her now two children so here we officially have the birth of Monica:the grown woman. The interesting part of this is,and the reason I will deduct a star from this album is that Monica has versatile vocal style that is more than a little suited to broader,funkier music. On the uptempo songs on this album,including the title song and songs such as ""Mirror"" Monica is producing herself with a very very generic commercial hip-hop sound that interesting enough forces her to sing at a pace a lot faster than normal to accomodate the brittle beats and because of the emphasis on beat rather than rhythm Monica's instrument is smothered by the need to speed up her singing and her special vocal qualities aren't as evident as they should be. Particularly difficult to listen to are the abrasive and by-the-numbers posturing rap on the title song which,even for someone like myself whose open minded to hip-hop kind of emphasizes a lot of the negative modern clishe's of the genre and isn't very welcoming musically. The rest of the album,however is a different story. Her interpretation of Evelyn King's somewhat unheralded ""If You Were My Man"" from the mid 80's get's an appropriate musical backup as Monica more fully explores her range. It's fitting that she chose a song by another former teen soul singer who not only helped pave the way for people like her but who managed to keep up with the times successfully even if her commercial fortunes often abandoned her. Even on the uptempo songs that lack in rhythmic intricacy the lyrics on this album are always arresting and compelling. On the midtempo ballad material such as the wonderful ""Once In A Lifetime"",""Superman"",""Love All Over Me"" and the closer ""Believing In Me"" the music takes on a slicker flavor that favors Monica's style a lot better than the overproduction on some of the faster tunes. On the concluding song her lyrics actually take on the topical stance of the modern 30 something and the general rebirth of the ""me"" generation wherein,for better or worse the selflessness involved in romantic relationships has again given way to a  ""me first"" attitude. Even though Monica means what she's saying,the reservation in her vocally delivery on the song isn't lost on me anyway. This is probably the best kind of album Monica could release at this particular time as contemporary R&B,stuck in a strong holding patter for the last decade or so is starting to adapt different elements into itself in order to keep itself fresh. If she expands the slicker elements of her music continually on her next album or two rather than keeps maintaining links to overly bomastic modern hip-hop productions she will definately be onto something.",Monica Believing In Herself,1281830400,,"unheralded ballad midtempo lyric reservation soul negative vocal relationship contemporary bomastic manage interpretation force album&nbsp;<a onto decade star genre somewhat raise way album,including sing like romantic arrest order woman which,even selflessness mind get's pace could songs need someone is,and actually rhythmic open listen normal title time last abandon conclude saying,the next child maintain suit mirror modern bad album,however enough posture versatile link flavor generation take something overly elements take different musical mean song whose teen monica's well range involve find music interest attitude fortune little faster birth vocally wherein,for tune help grow personally appropriate love part uptempo lot new beat turn delivery definately beat monica hip-hop rebirth cut generic lifetime"",""superman"",""love patter reason material hold kind lose speed adapt sing overproduction probably backup pave emphasize first lack commercial singer expand making successfully smother fully time album rhythm by-the-numbers particular favor particularly continually rap mid general r&b,stuck deduct stance anyway accomodate even former close period data-hook=""product-link-linked officially matter evelyn five musically rest class=""a-link-normal monica:the year prove chose release production man difficult sound buy intricacy fresh believing explore special welcome broader,funkier topical style since best two often story millenium instrument previous evident though life take keep wonderful king's people fit well abrasive always give another compelling me</a>&nbsp;and strong start produce emphasis quality keep slicker clishe's brittle rather"

Unlike numerous DC cohorts, Carpenter can actually sing.  No auto-tune here!  Sabrina Carpenter's the real deal.  The songs on this album are age-appropriate & provide a little something for all ages.  Tracks /notes:  1. Eyes Wide Open - easily the most radio-friendly track on here, hence there's more production [but not to the point Carpenter's voice is unrecognizable] compared to other songs on the album.  Still makes for a fun, catchy opener!  2. Can't Blame a Girl for Trying - has a breezy vibe to it (a la Colbie Callait)  3. The Middle of Starting Over - a G-rated version (melody-wise) of ""Trouble"" by Natalia Kilks, a singer who's definitely NOT for the kiddos(:  4. We'll Be The Stars - a very inspiring little pop tune!  5. Two Young Hearts - interesting melody; definitely allows Carpenter's vocals to take center stage.  Sounds like ""Two More Lonely People"" by Miley Cyrus.  6. Your Love's Like - more heavily produced (like the title track); very pop-sounding (again, like the title track)  7. Too Young - sounds a little like Taylor Swift's ""Back To December"".  Very pretty!  8. Seamless - picking up a country-pop vibe on this one; could picture Carrie Underwood recording this track  9. Right Now - another breezy, light Colbie Caillat-esq. tune.  10. Darling I'm a Mess - a cute little indie pop-sounding track.  11. White Flag - NOT a cover of the Dido song ""White Flag"".  Once more, an all-out campy pop tune.  12. Best Thing I Got  My only hope for this girl is, once she has ""aged out of"" DC /the House of Mouse is done with her, Carpenter won't spiral out of control (a la Lindsay, Miley, etc.) as she graduates into adult life because that would be such a waste of talent and a sad sight to see...",Sabrina's debut =impressive!,1454716800,,age track record breezy campy tune house pop-sounding sad melody-wise vocal pop maybe love's quite blame kilks sing dc who's like flag wide vocal adult mess kiddos song unrecognizable could carpenter darling actually caillat-esq age open channel's young lindsay dido title miley cohort group impress can't cute ms thing hearing girl's take definitely something trouble eye note lonely real song indie age all-out middle interest unlike ok fun star little stage hope auto-tune upon swift's picture one carpenter's back tween girl deal callait ability right waste radio-friendly hence point compare age-appropriate try vibe we'll sound cyrus sabrina target singer colbie light version produce seamless album la get underwood would melody mouse white track etc production still voice provide country-pop see audience easily pick heavily talent numerous december taylor catchy i'm sight carrie devote slighly best two g-rated opener cover hearts life inspire girl make center sabrina's there's allow graduate people disney natalia another do spiral start pretty control

So having read the hype up to this release I have to say that this is not exactly what I was expecting. With cultures current obsession with dystopian futuristic machine vs. man science fiction movies/books/themes going on it is no surprise to find one of the most prolific and adventurous progressive bands of our era delving into similar subject material. But, while themes of oppression, governmental control, revolution and war were expected, I never expected this to be a modern day version of Romeo & Juliet  sort of. In reality, it is all of those things and much more. This 2 hour concept double CD (4LP) production plays out like a play  truly an epic story of love, betrayal and redemption this was clearly written with the intent to take on the road as a big rock opera/theatrical production. Lyrically conceived and written by Petrucci, the story takes place some 200 years in the future where the reigning powers have allowed the NOMACS to suppress musical expression in favor of electronic noise (sound familiar?) In a manner similar to Rushs 2112, The Chosen One rises from the oppressed with the offer of the gift of music to humanity  the music to serve as the vehicle to spur revolution and the restoration of humanity. Yeah, its much more complicated than that but no spoilers here. The fun of an album like this is to be able to explore the characters, scenes and backdrop for oneself - far be it from me to spoil anybodys virgin listening experience.  Musically, this is truly different from where the band has gone before. Sure, theyve done the epic story telling tracks before (The Count of Tuscany just one example), but those songs really could stand alone. The Astonishing is an entire theatrical performance (akin to Pink Floyds The Wall) and plays out exactly in that fashion, each song dependent on the preceding track for support and context both lyrically and musically. Sound effects are used to create a cinematic vibe and there are some choral and symphonic elements but they never seem to overwhelm what the band is trying to accomplish. Its cool how the narration of the story is actually worked into the body of the songs so we don't get corny spoken parts interrupting the flow of music. The way they reference themselves in When Your Time Comes is brilliant. And in general, the genius with much of the diversity here is that if you take the work as a whole it actually pays tribute to many different forms of music (rock, jazz, classical, etc.) and in doing so specifically supports the legacy of Dream Theater and in general all forms of musical expression.  So what about the music that supports this epic story? Well, there are a few things that really surprised me. With the exception of the overture type songs that we hear at the beginning of Act I and Act II (not new to Dream Theater), it has been a long time since I heard these guys emphasize the melody and really serve the song in this regard. Some of these songs are a bit mellow (especially Act I), so don't expect huge technical riffing and endless soloing. That is definitely de-emphasized here to the point that I almost didn't believe what I was hearing at first (only because it was such a departure for DT), but with repeated listens these melodies are strikingly beautiful. Even Mangini takes a back seat to the song  his normally mathematical machinations supplanted by supporting rhythms injected with the occasional flamboyancies. Interestingly, much of this music reminds me of the Images and Words/Awake era in that regard, as well as Scenes From A Memory. The piano plays a huge role, especially in Act I. More surprising though is that LaBrie handles the vocals of (in addition to the narrator) ALL EIGHT of the key characters! Those familiar with Ayreon  Arjen Lucassen is the master of 2 CD concept releases  will recall his thing was to give each character in his stories a different voice in the form of an individual singer. Folks, James LaBrie does all of the voices here, which is extremely challenging. And while I would have loved to have heard some guest vocalists on a release like this, LaBrie makes it work. He is truly brilliant on this record. Look, Ive been a sceptic of his voice in the past, at times when his voice was less than stellar. But his performance here is THE focal point of The Astonishing  and to me that is astonishing in and of itself since the history of this band has always been that the vocals kind of take a back seat to the instrumental wizardry. Not so here. Although I will say that while Act I feels a bit more melody driven, Act II brings some of the heaviness, instrumental wizardry and soloing that fans will want. My final surprise with this release musically is that the NOMACS don't play a bigger role here. Their ""music"" only occupies 5 short tracks on the entire 2CD set. I really thought there might be more warring between traditional music and robotic music, but as it turns out the NOMACS are a very small part of the story here as this is really a story about humanity vs. humanity  the machines are controlled by the behavior of the humans, and the ultimate outcome dictated by human actions.  So where are the negatives? Well, more vocalists would have been more fun in my opinion but I applaud LaBries performance here  his best in nearly 2 decades. I don't like the long lag between tracks which makes no sense if this is actually to play out like a musical. The digipak presentation is very average, the insert booklet (which is bound to the inside of the digipak) very hard to read. And while I realize the deluxe packages and vinyl packages will provide more in the area of presentation I still cant help but think the label could have done a better job with a release of this magnitude. And so the deluxe editions (ridiculously delayed due to manufacturing issues until later this spring despite the money grab) should shine in this regard and provide even more depth into the story, but Ive yet to hear about any kind of 5.1 formats. I suspect that will come with a BD/DVD live presentation most likely after the tour has concluded. For me, I cant wait to hear the vinyl version. Although it was well advertised ahead of time that the deluxe box version was not going to be available until March, I was disappointed that the vinyl box set has been delayed since as it was originally slated for release today.  In summary, The Astonishing is a different beast, one that might frighten some fans away while simultaneously entice others to explore. But one thing is for sure  this is Dream Theater through and through, and I for one am really glad to see them not only revisit their more melodic roots but also bring something this inspiring, positive and this hugely theatrical to the stage.  3/17/16 - The vinyl version consists of 4 LPs housed in an impressive thick cardboard case containing Act I and Act II - each act a double gatefold 2LP  the impressive fold-out map one side/poster on other, and the FLAC download card. The 180gm black LPs (mine nice and flat) are contained within non anti-static, printed sleeves (a character on each side) and the lyrics themselves are printed on the inside of the gate-folds. I have to say, for the most part the packaging is primo but I do not understand why the lyrics are printed in the same small white font as the CD version and they don't fill the entire inner double gate-fold, so it looks awkward and its hard to read the lyrics. This is quite disappointing, to say the least. The artwork on the outside of the box does stand out, though, so thats a plus.  So how does this version sound? Well, with the criticisms about the overly compressed CD version being mostly valid, some fans will be glad to know that the vinyl version does really impart to these songs a more open and vibrant quality, although the difference between the CD and vinyl is not quite as noticeable on this release as that on, say the new Iron Maiden album where the vinyl sounds worlds better than the CD. The bass end does gain traction on the vinyl, but it still seems a bit suppressed (bass drum and guitar that is). What really stands out here are the vocals and some of the nuances in the music (like crowd and background noises) that really jump out of the speakers on the vinyl and really were background in the CD mix. And, the vinyl master sounds really great at high volumes (no distortion) and its here that the bass lines start to assert their power. Overall, I prefer this version, and Im not an audiophile snob as I realize that digital to analog has its pitfalls. In general, I still prefer D to A vinyl to overly compressed CD/mp3 quality most of the time (unless its HD 96/24 digital). Still, until we hear the live performances (which steal the show sound-wise from what Ive read in reviews so far) I think it is fair to say that the vinyl version, which sounds more dynamic and less compressed than the mp3/CD versions, does this composition more justice but still seems a bit lacking in the low frequency punch. Rotating 4 LPs through 8 sides is a lot of work for some so I think this will mostly appeal to those truly looking for the total listening experience to The Astonishing. To me the vinyl experience is a step up from the CD/mp3 version (these are clear/crisp sounding records), but for some the cost may be too steep to justify.","""The Truth Will Deliver Us Home...""",1454025600,,injected power steal go performance realize speak stand understand glad movies/books/themes anti-static heard electronic spoiler traditional actually composition akin overture tuscany presentation advertise mellow time focal insert get lyrically many theater thing expect flow sure different later song outcome surprise ive artwork read lps governmental suppress fun stage im write really decade despite part appeal guest obsession interrupt oppress point release far try volume revolution believe kind explore symphonic type spring machination big hour bit singer version step almost remind version melodic repeat theme complicate would ayreon revisit booklet hear anybodys familiar track oneself ahead futuristic jump band context listen release sound chosen experience rush font plus mangini maiden set overall support endless suppress applaud interestingly noise compress expect criticisms ultimate example do lag frequency may slat departure small surprise count give know bound performance virgin away lyric stellar hard black awkward clearly manufacture much thought rock words/awake character record like positive humanity vocal riff audiophile labries could come turn character shine noticeable might concept cost open normally sleeves modern sceptic betrayal expression hear due wait within analog effect definitely today element musical money fiction genius supplant good long theatrical tour frighten thick digipak technical machine dystopian favor one depth love role wall new future memory whole impressive astonish restoration material likely bd/dvd vehicle emphasize first line band help time history package gift issue etc cd general also floyds still accomplish voice see vibrant brilliant inside side/poster choral grab backdrop year fashion progressive human road story vocalists inner side war case arjen rhythm serve melody since map yet story clear/crisp though take spoil inspire originally diversity always deluxe exactly dt support narration justify labrie precede nice crowd yeah action gain work world traction extremely fold-out control conceive driven recall download prefer piano cardboard average song think others reality justice job punch create occupies war area least folk ridiculously hype pink voice take legacy regard big seem act consist form bass fan intent eight less although box music huge scene play petrucci dynamic nearly thing romeo behavior offer entire lot go image distortion back challenge flac robotic quality place sense similar beautiful low vibe juliet able impart james allow gate-fold used side come culture alone dictate cant steep dream assert cinematic mostly power background part white magnitude rotate theyve format provide oppression contain start form rise man corny occasional classical begin redemption best look mathematical snob entice sound body opera/theatrical flamboyancies solo well individual expect say overly difference final heaviness march look unless control stand non simultaneously narrator look track master fill strikingly find quite packaging double hugely gatefold way delay manner speaker valid love delve science conclude human guy specifically high hd pitfall beast addition something drum disappoint reign prolific feel great mine root iron surprising record bring lucassen play dependent summary thats subject epic ii live go exception sound worked adventurous tell truly outside card machine nomacs pay digital want suspect cool listen sort sound-wise nuance especially album house melody fair edition instrumental key production even reference noise primo musically day mix opinion tribute guitar current seat vinyl never bring de-emphasized short lack review disappoint contain support total seem end make negative handle flat print wizardry jazz available past show label gate-folds spur overwhelm era

She just started out.  But my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe. So safe that it bored me. I think I thought it was ""cute"" the first time I heard it but I still haven't seen the video and I don't care. I don't think I'll ever care for that song EVER.  And that's fine with me.  But this single...I heard it a few times and was like ""I like it. I really do.""  It's much more...her. I think. Still don't ""know"" the girl! But it just seems a bit less predictable. Sure, this love thing is tried and true to death, but this song is catchier to me, the production a LOT nicer (like a floating, ""this can't be real"" kinda feel) and it shows more vocal power. I will say at the end though, Jordin literally shrieks a note and it's just too loud. That could've been left out but if you don't mind belting, then this song is good pop music.  The vibe, playful and youthful (the eldest, Chris is only 18 after all).  And even though some of you are sick to DEATH of him (me excluded), Chris does a good vocal job here too. After hearing the SMASH, ""With You"" and a few of his older tracks, I can tell that even though they had no hand in the writing of this track, that at least Chris feels his part. Surely, Jordin does too.  I wish her luck in the future although I heard her album wasn't that great. Guess I didn't miss much!  3.9 stars (compared to the measly 2.25 i awarded the first single, Tattoo).  End note: I like Jordin. She's a sweety, got's a good set of pipes and she's damn pretty. However, I did have many gripes with her actually winning because although she was more marketable than Melinda (who got ROBBED!!!!!!), she didn't have the pipes like her nor quite like Lakisha.

They are a side project that is a spinoff of the Dixie Chicks. The story is that the sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire had an album's worth of material for a new Dixie Chicks album. The only problem was that the lead singer Natalie Maines wasn't exactly ready to go back into the studio. So, rather than let the songs sit around and collect dust, the sisters took it upon themselves to record an album, and the end result is the self-titled debut of the Court Yard Hounds.  This album, unlike their previous albums with the Dixie Chicks, leans more toward an alt-country/folk sound. A better way to describe this album is to imagine Shawn Colvin singing Sheryl Crow's songs. Emily writes and sings lead on every song except the ballad ""Gracefully"" which is sung and composed by Martie. It's a breakup song about a woman who wants to leave a man due to his dependency on alcohol. Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers stops by to duet on ""See You In The Spring"". The foot stomper ""Ain't No Son"" is an upbeat but sad song in which a father disowns his homosexual son. The album's closing track ""Fear Of Wasted Time"" deals with Emily singing about being a mother as well as a touring musician. However, the two best tracks on this album are the songs ""I Miss You"" and ""Then Again"". Overall, it's a great album from start to finish and this marks yet another album in country music that delivered the goods in the first quarter in 2010.",A fantastic debut from the Court Yard Hounds.,1273190400,,ballad track dust sad jakob self-titled closing wasted foot good country way martie fear colvin woman project however write song dependency stop deal musician wallflower yard breakup toward group get want sings emily due problem sung great composed real song alt-country/folk well music unlike sheryl finish record debut upon robison spinoff new back court lean let maguire mother material take quick singing worth maine album's let's spring first ready singer dixie studio shawn result time ain't natalie miss album hound mark imagine track chick tour see start leave lead duet except man sound sit side father album upbeat around describe disowns best overall two collect yet story stomper previous dylan son end homosexual alcohol gracefully sister deliver go quarter well crow's exactly another every rather

Until now.  ""The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-84"" more than rectifies this issue. The sound throughout these seven records is uniformly fantastic and each one leaps out of the speakers with impressive clarity and volume. It's cliched, but it really does feel like you are listening to some of these records for the first time, especially ""Greetings,"" ""Wild and Innocent,"" and ""The River,"" all of which suffered from either being too flat (the former two) or harsh and tinny (""The River""). There are parts of songs I never noticed before, particularly on more ponderous tracks like ""New York City Serenade"" and ""Drive All Night.""

The live version of this song was very awesome.  Sure, Kelly Hanson is not Lou Gramm.  But neither is Lou Gramm anymore.  Kelly Hanson is better in my opinion.  And like everyone I am entitled to my opinion.  This rendition of the song sounds like what the song would have sounded like had Kelly Hanson gone back via a time machine to those days when this song was first recorded.  It has the common restrained sound of the Columbia Records (or similar labels) of 1970s under the control of the likes of engineer who mastered the original Journey albums with Steve Perry.  Like Steve Perry of the 1970s, Kelly Hanson's voice sounds like it should for studio master recordings.  Studio is never meant to sound like live.  Some people seem to want what they had in Lou Gramm.  He's still there in the original recordings.  I was never of the mind that a song can only be recorded by one person and one person alone.  Sure, I love Lou Gramm same as anyone else.  He recorded the soundtrack of my early high school years.  But it is very nice to hear Kelly Hanson sing these songs.  And to know that when I am going to sit next to someone at the modern concerts they may possibly have heard Kelly sing these songs and hear the voice that they recognize.  A voice that sounds amazing when unrestrained and allowed to soar at concerts.  And I for one, among many, many, many others love it when the voice that will sing at the concerts is the voice you hear in the concert commercials.  Bravo Foreigner for keeping the band alive.  Bravo Kelly Hanson for doing a fine job with vocals. And bravo once again to Lou Gramm for giving us vocals to songs that we want to hear over and over again until we die.

I've always loved what Lenny Kravitz does; with his blend of soulful vocals, funky style and rock-edged beats, he is totally unique and has carved out a niche for himself that to my knowledge, only he occupies. The hits over the years have been are always brilliant - ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"", ""It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over"", ""Fly Away"", et al - but I've always felt that the real heart & soul of the man was to be found on his album cuts.  The last album of his I bought was 2001's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lenny/dp/B000LYM580/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lenny</a>&nbsp;(2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baptism/dp/B0001XAMC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baptism</a>&nbsp;passed me by completely) and though it was the single ""Dig In"" that made me buy it (after I heard it playing in a clothes store) it was tunes like ""If I Could Fall In Love"", ""Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)"", ""Stillness Of Heart"", ""Believe In Me"", ""A Million Miles Away"" and ""Let's Get High"" (which is not a song about drugs, by the way), that made me fall in love with the album, though some of these were also subsequently released as singles.  I don't hear any stand out hit singles along the lines of the ones I mentioned at the top but the album is no less enjoyable for it. I was nodding my head, tapping my feet and humming along right from the first play. These are all fantastic tunes with great vocal performances, solid beats and lots of wailing guitar. Favourites include ""Love Revolution"", ""Love Love Love"", ""I'll Be Waiting"" (heavenly orchestral), ""Will You Marry Me"" (totally funky, totally James Brown), ""A Long And Sad Goodbye"" (a plea in pain to a father; I can totally identify), ""This Moment Is All There Is"" (a heart-melting, hypnotic ballad), ""A New Door"" (another beautiful ballad) and ""I Want To Go Home"" (a great sing-along tune and a great way to close the album).  The album is produced and arranged by Kravitz and largely written and performed by him too, with help primarily from Craig Ross on electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin & handclaps, from a bassist whose name I couldn't make out, and from a long list of background vocalists and orchestra members. I'd name them all but I can barely see the writing on the inner-sleeve notes - the only flaw this album has, as far as I'm concerned. Simply beautiful. Rock on, Lenny, rock on.

The rapper and part time producer, who has been buzzing since his mixtape cascade began in 2010, seems to have his mind in the right place for Under Pressure, his studio debut. Executive produced by No ID and released by Def Jam and Visionary Music Group, Under Pressure boasts busy, luscious beats and a matured Logic confronting his rough past with a bright outlook on life. Logic starts the album with this positive tone and then delves into family stories and gets ambitious in the ""Soul Food"" two-parter. He covers a variety of topics throughout (girls, crime, movies, crew love, karma, etc.), but the most prominent and reoccurring of them include Logic's transition from a troubled, aimless childhood to mind- blowing music stardom and how it affects him and his family. Under Pressure's production as a whole captures several emotions and vibes, and it definitely has No ID's ambient beat making influence. A diverse array of producers including Visionary's 6ix and Logic himself supply rich electronic instruments and quick repeating hoots on more than one song. Logic proves himself a flavorful emcee, rapping at different speeds and cadences with a varying rhyme structure and awesome energy. He demonstrates multiple dimensions of creativity on tracks like ""Nikki,"" about a specific type of chemical dependency, and the title track ""Under Pressure,"" where he raps in the first person as his sister then father. The regular version of the album contains no guests but features Childish Gambino and Big Sean on two deluxe version bonus cuts. In the 12th track, ""Till The End,"" Logic recaps his rocky experiences in the music business and life in general but stays committed to keeping an optimistic attitude going forward. It is a fitting close to the album, where Logic shares his feelings and conveys again his project's chief mood.

I'm now about halfway through it, and the highlight so far is a fabulous performance of Gluck's ""Orfeo e Euridice."" Maureen Forrester, the greatest contralto of her generation, is downright awesome as Orfeo. I don't think she ever sang any better than this. Teresa Stich-Randall is fine, as ever, as Euridice, and the young Charles Mackerras wields a supportive and sensitive baton as he conducts Bach Guild's standby Vienna State Opera Orchestra. This performance alone is more than worth your 99 cents. Check out the reviews of the earlier CD release here, where it's selling from 3rd parties for $39.99:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gluck-Orfeo-Euridice/dp/B0000023D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gluck: Orfeo & Euridice</a>. Now admittedly, Gluck's Orfeo is not a baroque choral work, but I'm not complaining! Another favorite is the Pergolesi Stabat Mater--I started with this because I like the soprano, Stich-Randall, and mezzo Elizabeth Hngen. The recording also features Anton Heiller on organ and Mario Rossi conducting the VSOO. It's gorgeous! I've also enjoyed the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi could really write for voices as well as he could write for fiddles) and John Blow's impassioned ""Ode on the Death of Henry Purcell"". Blow had been Purcell's teacher and sponsor and so this work is especially personal. Also lovely is Charpentier's Magnificat--a graceful and melodius setting. I haven't hit a bad performance yet, and I'm looking forward to exploring further.

The same guy who played organ in the Spencer Davis Group?""  You automatically get a road map of Winwood's new 80's direction.  It's a direction of synthesizers dominating his sounds, and soloing with unique keyboard phrases that defines this era of his career.  Arc Of A Diver is the beginning of  Winwood where he redefines himself.  The album's mix is below par.  The instrumentations that are put together also fail to adhered some kinda of unity, but this is excused because Steve Winwood played all the instruments.  Winwood also engineered and mixed the whole album.  In my opinion when it comes to artists that play all their instruments on their albums I put Arc Of A Diver in the top 5.  Their are some good uptempo danceable songs like ""Second Hand Women"", and ""Night Train.""  ""Slowdown Sundown"" is more classic Winwood ballad.

At first I thought it would be a case of ""I just like one song by this group,"" but when I listened to their song ""Warriors,"" I knew I would like this band.  I'm normally not a fan of modern rock, but Imagine Dragons is quickly proving to be the exception, and their album ""Night Visions"" has really grown on me.

The former is a thunderous and raw song, but strangely hopeful despite the dystopian, post-apocalyptic theme of it.  ""On Top of the World"" is quite different, a livelier and upbeat number that wouldn't be out of place in a Dreamworks movie.

Other favorites on this album include the pop-flavored ""Tip Toe,"" the powerful ""Demons,"" and the more subdued but still thoughtful and pleasant ""Amsterdam.""

1963,54823,3,,False,"08 10, 2008",A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B001ESDIQ0,,E.J. Rupert,"Lil Wayne - Tha Carter III (Cash Money, 2008)  Mainstream hip-hop fans vs. underground hip-hop fans: can't we all just get along? I mean, is it cool to dig both Lil Wayne AND Little Brother? (Incidentially, Wayne did make a guest appearance on Little Brother's last album, suggesting that his appeal stretches beyond the Billboard charts.) Well, although I'm more of a fan of underground, indie hip-hop, I'll give credit to where it's due. Lil Wayne is a pretty nice rapper and he was even nice in 1998 when he was on Big Tymers' ""Millionaire Dream"". And although he hit a dry spell (namely during 2001-2003 when the Cash Money trend was dying and people were leaving the label), he reengerized and came with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tha-Carter/dp/B00027JYPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tha Carter</a>. That album wasn't all that great except for the song, ""Ain't That a B***h"", which was lyrically sharp. That set the stage for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tha-Carter-II/dp/B000BLI4UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tha Carter II</a>, which found Weezy F. Baby finding his niche. Then came all the mixtapes and guest appearances on every song, occasionally making songs by nobodies sound better (i.e., Playaz Circle's ""Duffle Bag Boy"" and Shop Boyz' ""Party Like a Rockstar"" remix). With so much critical acclaim, of course there would be so much hype for the much-delayed Carter III.  There are a couple of hot tracks on here like ""3 Peat"", the inspired ""Tie My Hands"" and the David Banner-produced ""La La"". But the best song is the innovative ""Dr. Carter"", where Wayne plays a surgeon operating on wack MC's. Swizz Beatz (with a beat that is very uncharacteristic of him) takes a David Axelrod sample (""The Smile"") and when the music intensifies, Wayne follows suit with his rhymes. The nurse then tells him of each patient's condition. If only all of Wayne's songs were this clever.  In fact, if Wayne could spend his time making actual songs, the album would be better. A lot of times, we find him just spitting off the dome, saying nonsensical stuff and lazily getting through a song, making tracks like Kanye West's ""Let the Beat Build"" good only because of the beat itself. Other times, he makes songs that scream, ""My next single"", like the subpar ""Mrs. Officer"" and the ringtone-friendly ""Lollipop"" (which was a single). Also, the last track, ""Dontgetit"", finds Wayne talking out his you-know-what about society today and why he hates Al Sharpton. Leave that conscious rap for Talib Kweli.  There are many times last year when Lil Wayne spit a rewindable lyric and you'll have no choice but to compare the songs on this album to those moments. Has he used up his best material already? It's hard to say. But Tha Carter III is still one of the better mainstream hip-hop albums of the year.

After all, its been 16 years waiting for Detox which he eventually confessed on the Pharmacy that he didn't like it and scrapped it. I don't know about you but the leaked tracks and the ones he released sounded amazing. Just search Dr. Dre detox unreleased on YouTube and you will find those joints with Jay Z, Eminem, TI and Game. Dope! Pure Genius!  Now, I purchased this on iTunes like everyone because at the time they said it was exclusive to Apple and there was no word on the cd launch. I couldn't wait or take any chances so I bought it the night of the streaming. When I first heard it I thought it was just not sounding right from my laptop so I copied it to my mp3 player and cd and took it to ride along to with my homeboy the same night. We were both so disappointed! What is up with this new sound and how does the beats, lifestyle and pure genius from the NWA days INSPIRE you to make this?  Dre has spent the last 16 years perfecting Detox and didn't release it because he felt it was leaked, didn't live up and all that yet he can finish an album in a few weeks and release it thinking we will all love it after a ""few listens"" or hoping it ""will grow on us"" or ""keep an open mind"" as some reviewers are saying on amazon. No it doesn't work like that Dre and to my fellow fans we deserve better and we were owed a better album and he has to be accountable for this.

I didn't expect a Chronic follow up or a Chronic sound, I expected a fantastic final album from the best Rap Producer of all time. Dre disappointed many fans and don't tell me I need to give it a chance and a few spins to grow on me. Is that what a Dre album has come to or what we should settle for?

2005,71277,4,138.0,True,"08 9, 2011",ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B005CV7CNA,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},T. Fisher,"I have been turning more toward solo piano music lately, and this collection is a welcome bargain that features mainly very solid performances.  The artists are generally excellent performers, but not the most famous names -- with one major exception, as Hungary's Jeno Jando features most prominently in the set, with 29 tracks. I consider him an international A-list pianist -- not that I'm an expert, but Jando is certainly the real deal.  French pianist Evelyne Dubourg, who has recorded quite a bit on the Tudor label, is the second most featured artist, on 15 tracks, and performs very well. I also found the playing on the six tracks by Peter Rsel very engaging.  There are a few problems, however. For one, track No. 7, which is supposed to be the 2nd movement of Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto Op. 16, is in fact a repeat of track No. 1, the famous bit from Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. (Update: I understand this has now been corrected -- check the samples to make sure.)  There are also a few technical glitches, like a distracting ""click"" on the fade out on track 11 (Robert Schumann's ""Trumerei""), at 3:03. Track 69, the 2nd movement of Schubert's Piano Sonata in Am, has some serious noise issues, especially at about 2:40. A little more care in production could have caught mistakes like these.  Also, it's a shame that on orchestral pieces (excerpts from piano concertos and the like), only the names of the orchestras are listed. It is customary to credit the soloist as well, and not doing so is, well, impolite.  Finally, buyers of previous sets from Cobra Entertainment will face a high repetition rate. I have only purchased two of their sets previously --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Must-Have-Chillout-Classics/dp/B0051QU0M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99 Must-Have Chillout Classics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Must-Have-Mozart-Masterpieces/dp/B0051U6XZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99 Must-Have Mozart Masterpieces</a>&nbsp;-- and already this collection gives me 36 tracks that are outright repeats of performances from those other sets. (The large majority of the repeats are from the ""Chillout"" set.) While I realize that content providers make their living by repackaging and reselling content, this kind of repeat rate after so few purchases appears to bode poorly for the future.  That all being said, is this set worth the introductory price of $1.99? You betcha, and then some. This is great music and overall, highly recommended. Plenty of ""greatest hits"" that everyone will recognize, but also many well-performed gems that are a little more off the beaten path. A well-programmed collection.

For this CD  Cher sings 9 songs  penned by 9 male songwriter's and 1 by  female songwriter Janis Ian ( Stars)  the  album was  produced by Jimmy Webb. This album is  recorded, produced, and sung by Cher  just  beautifully. Her version of ""These  Days"" by Jackson Browne is amazing. Every song on this CD fits perfectly. This is Cher as a mature, serious singer with  the ability to do these songs as they should be. ""Just this one time"" is the best thing Cher has ever recorded the range of her singing this song is down right perfection.  We all  know  Cher  is a great actress and i think  this comes out in her singing this songs with such emotion and feeling. If you read the reviews you will see all Cher's fans love this CD. We need Cher to do a complete album with songs recorded where great song  writer's give her the chance to sing the songs her way.

All in all, while this isn't the worst Christmas album I've ever heard, it's certainly not all that good.  The vocals are all over the place--by the third song, I was hoping for a new vocalist to take over.  They seem to have been done rather quickly, with few if any retakes, and to be honest, I don't feel that the lead vocalist has the vocal qualities to maintain interest for more than ten or fifteen minutes, much less an entire album.  The music behind him is competent, of course, but nothing at all special--it, too, sounds like it was done rather quickly.  Christmas albums are often like that--groups don't spend nearly as much time rehearsing or recording them.  The bottom line is that for every standard on here, I have four of five versions that are much better than these.  For the new songs, there was nothing that made me take notice, nothing that I felt I really wanted to hear again.

Durham,"Contrary to just about everyone else saying ""Master of Puppets"" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt ""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is ""Fade to Black"", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  ""Trapped Under Ice"" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  ""Escape"" is hte only song that could be classified as ""filler material"", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is ""Creeping Death"", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental ""Call of Ktulu"" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, ""Ride the Lightning"" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.","""Flash before my eyes, now it's time to die...""",1030060800,,lars drum give want second seven track lyric master black staple chill much chair recognize double assault sonic fire ever complaint start say section deal song burton's could hear courtesy classified shine talent think ride mean next title everyone time toll get favorite puppet frozen craft great solid test kirk song feel bass trap acoustic dealing contains cliff's await biblical whats put thing really bell hte that's help one personally death creeping showcase electric popular leave material haunting follow fine james nuclear opus become collection pun first contrary minute time intend reference call especially album riff rhythm aftermath metallica metal hear hammett bad instrumental ktulu felt also pound bandmembers even cliff band hetfield five else filler day fan's ice guitar escape execution metallica's short album special classical suicide lightning best chorus member's concert cover ulrich's suffocate fade fight warfare well always extreme do another essential final every starting pulse

Cross,"""Saturate Before Using"", ""Late For The Sky"" and this album (and I suppose ""Runnin' On Empty"" too although I've yet to hear it - I can't imagine it would be bad, though) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan. EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production, lyrics, musicianship, singing...etc. This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio (and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that). This paid off in spades, however, as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60's! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another (very cool). The lyrics, as always, are extremely quotable, deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan. Unlike Dylan, though, the lyrics are, like title of the album, ""For Everyman"". As opposed to ""Saturate Before Using"" and ""Late For The Sky"", ""For Everyman"" is the more consistent album - there aren't any ""bad"" songs (not that the other two had bad songs, a bunch just weren't as good as the highlights).

This album here is one of the weakest albums I have heard from Jackyl. No, I am not one of those fans who say the first album was the only good album, far from it, but this album here to me failed to produce those stand out songs that are worthy of being inducted into Jackyls live set, or best of considerations. I consider their last album, ""When moonshine and dynamite collide"" to have much better stand out tracks than this one here.  To try and prove I'm not just giving this album a low rating because i'm not much into Jackyl, than i'll include previous review ratings.  Jackyl (1992)  - ***** (5) Push Comes to Shove - ****  (4) Cut The Crap  - ****  (4) Relentless  - ****  (4) When Moonshine and..- ****  (4) Stayin' Alive  - ***  (3.5)  So, I'm not someone who gives Jackyl low scores... even some of those albums fans have rated much lower, but I enjoyed quite a few of the tracks. However this album failed to produce much at all that stood out and would be a memorable enough song to consider Jackyl adding to live shows and best of's..  1. Best In Show  - Not a great song. ** 2. Encore  - I get where they're going with this, but it could have been better instead of feeling generic. ** 3. Screwdriver  - Probably the best song on the album, but not worthy of much more than 3 stars. *** 4. Horns Up  - Are they trying anymore? ** 5. Golden Spookytooth  - Easily forgettable. 6. Cover Of The Rolling Stone - ** 7. Walk My Mile  - ** 8. Favorite Sin  - ** 9. Better Than Chicken  - Weird, but kinda catchy, but still weird. *** 10. Don't Lay Down On Me  - ** 11. Eleven  - ** Some of the songs I even felt like Jessie wasn't singing in key, and it made it hard to listen to anymore of those songs. Bonus Track 12. It's Tricky  - They could have done a much better job of covering this than they have. **  Overall score. ** (2.5) the lowest score I have given a Jackyl album so far. Like I said, some songs sounded like Jessie was singing out of key. A few songs sounded like they where forced out, aka Fillers, and the best of the songs was just enjoying listening to Jackly sing their signature backing vocals loudly to make even some of the weirdest lyrics sound cool. But where is the super stand out songs? This album feels like it is missing the big single, and the 2 extra awesome rocking tracks, and instead give a few left overs and a sore attempt at recreating ""Secret of the bottle"".  Sorry, but this album to me is the worst effort from Jackyl so far... well, worst overall album unless you discard the live versions and cover songs from ""Stayin' Alive"" then that would be the worst effort... but this one here only contained one cover song, and it didn't sound like they nailed it enough to make it their very own.  But, a swing and miss here won't make me say the band have struck out, I'm sure they will come out swinging and hit harder on the next album.

I have several in my household, ranging from A Charlie Brown Christmas to a Bobby Sherman Christmas. I also have Mitch Miller's famous one, along with Phil Spector's Christmas Album. And I can safely say that this album can stand with those easily.  Bob Dylan's Christmas in the Heart is one of the best Christmas albums I've ever heard.  There is a tendency by people to mock this album even before hearing it. Bob Dylan making a Christmas album? Even as a Dylan fan, I was surprised at first, then delighted. This is a really good and heartfelt album.  It has excellent arrangements of Christmas classics, and it has a few tunes that I've never heard before (like The Christmas Blues).  The arrangement of Must Be Santa is rocking and phenonemal, to say the least.  Dylan even adds some hysterical lyrics at the end, and it totally works. On Dylan's last album, Together Through Life, the arrangements were a little loose and relaxed.  Sometimes that worked, other times it didn't. Here, Dylan's band is tight as they have ever been, and it really helps the music immensely. Sure, Dylan's voice is, to quote a song of his, like a ""bullfrog croakin'"", but it doesn't bother me that much.  In fact, on some of the ballads here, his ragged voice works wonders, like on some of the ballads on Modern Times.  The best examples of that are The First Noel, Silver Bells, and Hark the Herald Angels Sing.  I also love the tenderness of Winter Wonderland and The First Noel here, and the charm of Here Comes Santa Claus as well.  This album has turned out to be one of Dylan's most polarising albums EVER, and I'm really not entirely sure why.  Some of the reactions are downright bizarre at times.  Maybe it's because Dylan is truly sincere here, paying tribute to Christmas songs he heard when he was a child, and that there is no condenscension towards the audience here.  No self conscious smugness.  Just a great record brilliantly performed.  Many people were polarised by Dylan's Christian period as well (which was much underrated in my opinion). Normally, I would recommend this album to Dylan completists, but I recommend it to everyone now. I'm not going to be an idiot contrarian by saying it's Dylan's best album ever (it isn't), but I like it as much as Together Through Life (his other 2009 album), and I have played it quite a lot since I bought it back in November 2009.

So when this album came out, in all it's velvet splendor-it sported a velvet cover, but no single to back it up.  After 45 years, I finally downloaded and listened to it, and there were some songs that could have been singles, although they departed from the 'formula' because they went in a slightly 'country' direction, an idea from one of the non brother members of the band.  Country and symphony, who knew?  The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release/  They would come back stronger in the 70's, but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins.  The only song that may be familiar is First of May, but the music and lyrics are top notch.  The boys were finding their own voices and style.  But when you consider all the good music coming out in '69-Abbey Road, The who, the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts, this one, probably also because of it's cost' was ignored.

Luther Ingram was an R&B singer/songwriter from Jackson, TN. Ingram was best known for the early '70s hit ""(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"".  Ingram made his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed with KoKo Records in the late 1960's. His first hit ""My Honey And Me"" peaked at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts, even though Koko was only a small label, owned by his manager and record producer, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.  ""(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right"" is a song written by Stax Records songwriters Homer Banks, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson and first released by Bobby ""Blue"" Bland. The song is about an adulterous love affair, told from the point of view of either the mistress or the cheating spouse, depending on the gender of the performer. Luther Ingram recorded his version of the tune in 1972. It would become a Top Ten smash peaking at #3 in August of that year.

Since his move, Landon has established Healing Piano of Sedona which offers a unique sound healing experience to create mental, physical and emotional well-being. Landon is a Steinway Artist who has toured internationally and has released seventeen albums, eleven of which are solo piano (one is a best of). He has been using the techniques of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for spiritual development since 1980. Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously, passionately, stress- and disease-free.  The thirteen tracks on ""Healing Hearts"" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well-being. I have to admit that in the past, I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music, but he is improvising and performing so much now that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and complete and the emotional content is rich and sincere. Landon has performed house concerts in my series every year for the past seven years and while his music has always been exceptionally good, now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty. Nothing is held back, coming from the purest source of creativity. Im blown away by the music on ""Healing Hearts"" and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014.  Most of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity. In fact, Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace and I can see why! A couple of pieces are a bit livelier, but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background. However, be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment, the day, or life in general - at least for a while.  All of the tracks are exceptional, but Ill mention a few favorites. Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful, tender and very warm. Gorgeous! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful. I love the title track, which is more minor and a bit darker, but so poignant and compelling. Now or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently but firmly. Sacred is almost hymn-like. The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member who passed away recently. Dark and sometimes painfully sad, there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit that can flow from one artist to another. Unstoppable begins quietly and simply, gradually building energy, strength and power. Unstoppable, indeed!

No, think Inception-Lite, then add in some electronic beats. By Inception-Lite, I mean the music between soundtracks is kind of interchangeable, but there's clearly a more quality winner here. In fact, much of the soundtrack barrows from the Hans Zimmer school of thinking, not just the certain horn structure that was so infamously from Inception (The Game has Changed), but the strings, how the strings are arranged, the moods given off, etc. Granted, I know the soundtrack was composed before Inception ever came out, but the whole thing sounds very Zimmer-Esque.  Why is this? Well, the soundtrack may be ""by"" Daft Punk, but Joseph Trapanese did much of the orchestrations, with only the guidance of Daft Punk. Daft themselves did the electronic work. As a result, the work sounds very much like a modern soundtrack. But since Zimmer holds the example of the modern soundtrack currently in my mind, it sounds very derivitive of that for me. Not that this is a bad thing per say, but the entire score does hold an ever-present feeling of familiarity. It's mixed up by the electronic elements of course, which sound something straight out of a future nightclub, complete with weird DJ stuff, drumbeats and other tricks of the Daft Punk trade. Still, it doesn't sound amazing enough to stand on its own.  Another thing I must bring about is the theme. You know, the one introduced in the first track as a grandiose piece, comes back for a couple tracks at the beginning, then starting back with ""Arrival,"" dominates the rest of the proceedings. It's a rather simple horn piece, and it's used to great effect, but if feels like it also uses it as a crutch much too often. Introduction moment. Bring in the theme. Action moment. Bring in the theme. Emotional moment. Bring in the theme. Triumphant moment. Bring in the theme. End credits. Bring in the theme, remixed by Daft Punk. You see my point? It's a great and memorable theme, but it's a bit too simple to be as used as often as it is.  Overall, Tron Legacy the soundtrack is not bad. It's a solid effort, but suffers from the stark feeling of familiarity wherever you go. Did it really take them two years to compose this? Still it's a must-have for soundtrack fans, and if it draws in non-soundtrack fans, then I'm fine with that too.

This album, ""Dystopia"" sounds like it could fit in between ""Rust in Peace"" and ""Countdown to Extinction""  and to lesser extents ""Peace Sells"" and ""So Far"" at times with the way that it sounds but there is so much musical complexity and excellent songwriting and musicianship here. Dave Mustaine's voice also is wonderful on here; I prefer it to any other album he's released I think. He layers it but has a powerful, rough delivery and sometimes has harmonies mixed in lower which sounds cool. The songs themselves are each amazing in their own right and there's even an instrumental that is up there with Metallica's best ones (Orion, Call of Ktulu)). Megadeth definitely breaks barriers as far as guitar work is concerned here. This is some of Dave Mustaine's best guitar work and composition to date in my opinion. I know hype often disappoints but if you are a Megadeth fan or even a metal fan, I think you will love this album. It is a masterpiece and I am glad that I got the version that allows you to order a vinyl copy. I'm also glad that Dave could put something like this out for the younger kids and show them what true metal is (I think Slayer did a great job with keeping things going too with their new one even with a new guitarist and drummer).

Reuniting in the studio for the first time since their 1997 release, Album of the Year, the San Fransisco based experimental rockers have responsibly recorded an album that die hard fans can declare worthy of the near two-decade-long sabbatical. Sol Invictus picks right up where Album of the Year left off. Having listened to their 1997 effort a bunch of times leading up to the new release, I can say with absolute certainty that Sol Invictus sounds exactly like what I'd have expected from the band in 1999, let alone 2015. In short; they truly meant it when they said they were recording a Faith No More album that sounds like Faith No More.  Mike Patton's vocals are amazing as always and his classic delivery has lost nothing over the years. All of his side projects have kept him in top shape and Sol Invictus benefits greatly from that fact. Roddy Bottum's keyboards gives the album the right amount of ambience and ethereal quality. Billy Gould and Mike Bordin's familiar backbone will jump right out at you and Jon Hudson's guitar performance is probably one of his best offerings on this album.  It's difficult to pin point all the great elements of each song, as I've always approached Faith No More's music as a full-album experience. At least since 1992s Angel Dust. Superhero and Mother, the two lead singles, are hard-driving rock delights, but Cone of Shame and From The Dead really shine a light on Patton's operatic vocal abilities. Matador is a highlight, especially for fans of Bottum's synth playing. Black Friday features Patton's sung-in-spoken word vocals that we've all come to know and love. As an album in its entirety, it comes close to Faith No More's finest work to date. I hope we don't have to wait another eighteen years for a new album, but if it's as good as this one, I'll wait patiently.",Right where they left off!

Like Elliot Smith, Kevin Parker writes songs that feel lonely. Isolated. Also like Elliot Smith, Parker's songs come from a place deep down inside of himself. The outside world is of no concern to Kevin Parker. The world in his head is where he writes from. But unlike Elliot Smith, I don't believe Kevin Parker is sad about being alone. Kevin Parker isn't a tortured soul. He's just an old soul. And from that technicolor landscape deep in Kevin Parker's head is where the excellent new album Lonerism comes from. A place where John Lennon joined Blue Cheer and commited himself to acid head trip jams and Sid and Marty Krofft directed episodes of Little House on the Prairie. Tie-dyed tees and bean bag chairs. Schwinn Stingrays and key parties. Parker isn't old enough to have experienced the 70s, so he's re-creating them one album at a time. This time out he's perfected them.  `Be Above It' starts the album out with a looped voice repeating ""Gotta be above it"" continuously, along with a looped drum part before Parker comes and turns this song into an anthem of sorts. A PSA straight from Perth, Australia. At first listen it's odd, but after you hear it 2 or 3 times it becomes this almost beautiful mantra. `Endors Toi' has that windswept stoicism that permeated Tame Impala's excellent Innerspeaker. `Apocalypse Dreams' sounds like a lost Lennon track. A mix of `A Day In The Life' and Plastic Ono Band idealism with a pinch of THC for good measure. `Mind Mischief' has a great rock `n roll groove by way of Marc Bolan. Then once you get midway into this excellent album you are hit with three amazing acid-tinged pop tracks. `Music To Walk Home By', `Why Won't They Talk To Me' and `Feels Like We Only Go Backwards' are some of the catchiest pop songs you will likely hear this year. Parker shows what a true pop music revivalist he is at heart. `Keep On Lying' is in a class of it's own. It's a long, strange meditation on Parker's own headspace. Who's he lying to? Us? Himself? It doesn't matter cause I dig his lies. Every single one of them. The fact that Kevin Parker's voice reminds me of a younger, reincarnated John Lennon only adds to the love I'm feeling for Tame Impala right now. Parker breaks out the riff strut of `Elephant' to pull us out of our LSD-daze, if just for a moment. It's about as rocking as it gets in Tame Impala country. Much like the Innerspeaker track `Island Walking'(sadly not included on the vinyl version), `Elephant' grabs ahold with a monster guitar riff that lives up to the song's namesake. Much like `Runways, Houses, City, Clouds' on Innerspeaker, `Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control' is the epic, existential moment on an already epic record. I'll spare you a long explanation of what it means, cause I don't know.  In one word: transcendence.  Tame Impala have given us a gift in Lonerism. Perth, Australia has given us a gift in Kevin Parker. Lonerism seems to be a state of mind. A state of mind where it's okay to be alone. A place where you're comfortable with the ghosts of the past and the visions of a place that has never really existed come together to make a technicolor dream you needn't wake from.

Having said that, ""Southeastern"" was still astonishing to me. A favorite roots rocker suddenly became one of my favorite songwriters of all time.

So any lengthy review isn't needed for this new additional set of music.  If you like the tunes found on the original set (which are different from the versions on this new set) you'll find even more to like across these three discs and the DVD.  Suffice to say these performances (with a few songs appearing more than once) are superb--Morrison and his hot band are on cracking form.  Morrison knew how to sing a lyric--his tone, his inflection, the small spaces he leaves between words or phrases--all accent his emotional range over these songs.  And listen to the bass/drums foundation that seamlessly propel this  music.  The strings rounding off some of the sharper edges.  The horns when they get pumping.  And that piano!  Like many of you I also ordered Vol. 1 because the sound (using the original tapes) has been improved for that 'you are there'  feel.  The DVD is an equal visual treasure of Morrison on stage during this period.  And speaking of Vol. 1--the new set is a tri-fold cardboard package with a pocket for each disc.  There's a few color  photos of Morrison (mostly) and the band on stage.  And again there's no booklet.  In a nutshell--this may be the best (and best recorded) example of live Van Morrison and his Caledonia Soul Orchestra with few (if any) less impressive moments.  When people talk about Morrison as  a performer this set (and Vol. 1) is all the proof needed.  And if for some reason this era of Morrison's music is new to you--buy with complete confidence.  The packaging is a five panel fold-out  cardboard style for the discs, with snap-in trays (with photos underneath)  for each disc, with a  panel with a  pocket for the 10 page booklet that has a two paragraph explanation of the music, track list for each disc, a list of band members, and a few photographs.

I also warm to her covers of two tracks associated with Patsy Cline.  ""Walkin' After Midnight"" has been covered by so many singers from Wanda Jackson to Kellie Pickler to Loretta Lynn.  In Cyndi's hands it has a pulsing beat with Cyndi massaging the melody playfully, ""I walk for miles along the highway, that's just my way of saying 'I love you.'""  ""I Fall to Pieces"" has been recorded by so many including ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith, Linda Ronstadt, and yes, Loretta Lynn.  Cyndi goes a little deeper into her register to milk the sadness out of the vocals, ""You want me to act like we've never kissed; You want me to forget, pretend we've never met; And I've tried and I've tried, though I haven't yet.""

Here we have Chevelle, on their eighth studio album, still on a major label and yet not shedding one single ounce of integrity.  In fact, ""The North Corridor"" may be their heaviest and densest album to date. Re-teaming with Joe Barresi, who also produced the band's previous two albums, Chevelle have crafted a tightly-wound ten song set that plays to their strengths as an even tighter live act. The album busts open with ""Door To Door Cannibals,"" the sort of song Page Hamilton should really be pounding out at this point in his career. Thick guitar riffs careen over the ever-reliable rhythm section while frontman Pete Loeffler stabs and howls his way through what is essentially an anti-single. Likewise, the other nine tracks aren't the sort of thing you're bound to hear alongside the current crop of over-produced rock bands. On ""Young Wicked,"" the main Loeffler seems to be echoing golden-era Maynard James Keenan as he snarls and fights against the gravity of the music. While there's nothing here that screams ""hit single,"" ""Joyride (The Omen)"" comes close in its fierce catchiness. Like most of the album it's punchy and to the point, fierce and intensely focused.  As always, Barresi's production does the band sweet, sweet justice. Dean Bernardini's thunderous basslines drive many of the songs, while drummer Sam Loeffler is, as always, the key ingredient to the band. Few modern rock drummers can match his air-tight and infectious delivery, and it locks in perfectly with Pete's hooky guitar riffs. While it's true that Chevelle still sound very much like Chevelle, it's amazing how they can keep hammering away at their own brand and still churn out gold like this. Few bands of this ilk have mastered the art of maintaining their identity without repeating themselves, but ""The North Corridor"" not only continues to push the band along on its journey, but pays tribute to the young music-loving kids that started the whole thing to begin with as well. ""The North Corridor"" is a sound so big and overwhelming that, frankly, it's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.","As Always, Wonder What's Next...",1468800000,,give joe bound dean shed infectious over-produced away hard power barresi churn gold much door radio fierce drive rock hallway genre focus way echo riff scream like career riff space true trio section define start tightly-wound song thunderous frankly eighth think bernardini's open young joyride hot justice howl cannibal last turn maintain nothing modern share helmet many thing re-teaming within drummer journey seem take craft crop big air-tight force act skateboarder heaviest amaze song master begin ever-reliable basslines maynard date wicked rock music chevelle play consistency stage thick brand really repeat tool gravity omen one fact fight push page lot anti-single delivery back ilk strength whole golden-era point hamilton live sweet drummer sam single james lock likewise quickly stab perfectly become island come punchy major continue corridor pay ten studio unto hooky band dense careen sort produce frontman album rhythm would nine dog hear track identity also close key integrity keenan match still pound production ounce even hit band art year intensely tribute guitar sound north loeffler current kid churn main album music-loving barresi's set band's two bust catchiness yet ingredient evolve along hammer tighter previous without hit-single snarl there's overwhelm alongside throw essentially well always label awful may keep pete pete's

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.  While a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE / CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.  This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

The song writing is also really good, the more folky songs like ""Yon Two Crows"" and ""Haul Away"" have definite British references but so do some of the more rocky songs like ""Corned Beef City"" and even the down home country blues ""After the Bean Stalk"" refers to pantomimes! Mark and co-producer Guy Fletcher do a great job in achieving amazing sounds on all the different styles of music on this record, helped by the excellent band featuring amongst others Richard Bennett on guitars, Jim Cox on keyboards and Ian Thomas on drums.  One real bonus for me is the presence of Kim Wilson's wonderful blues harmonica on so many of the tracks and this is definitely Mark's most bluesy album. He fully demonstrates his skill as a very versatile blues guitarist, both electric and acoustic and with or without slide, and like all the best blues guitarists he can show real emotion through his playing. However, his voice is just as effective and is totally individual (with just a nod to Dylan) and on many of the slower songs like ""Go, Love"" his vocals are heart-breakingly sad.  This is a very consistent album and with so much variety that it means it is very hard to pick one track as your favourite.

A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk.

The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.    The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer ""Sparkling In The Sand"". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going.

LUSH LIFE is one out of the three Ronstadt forays into the world of jazz standards and WWII-era pop numbers. Like its companions WHAT'S NEW and FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS, it captures the multi-faceted soprano buoyed by Nelson Riddle's big band stylings. Riddle, the former Frank Sinatra arranger, employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson, Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey. Ronstadt's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic. At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet, but Ronstadt sings such faves as ""When I Fall In Love,"" ""Skylark,"" ""Sophisticated Lady,"" ""Falling In Love Again,"" ""Lush Life"" and ""You Took Advantage Of Me"" with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle's overly ambitious arrangements.",Lush Life - Excellent,997488000,,fall pop lush like romantic arranger bellson song multi-faceted arrangement luminary ronstadt world nelson time riddle charm orchestration grolnick perform get fall wwii-era sings enough journey reason big sentimental ronstadt's linda range companion little one asher orchestra love new foray number stylings sweet take interpretation grace collection aid overshadow sassy what's faves employ standard former sinatra playful band advantage ambitious buoy capture delightful skylark classic along peter life frank sophisticated jazz overly three louie lady soprano riddle's

If you liked ""The Division Bell"", and particularly, the instrumentals on that album (""Marooned"" and ""Cluster One"") then you'll probably like this even more.  You don't get a lot of David Gilmour vocals here, but you do get a lot of his signature guitar playing, and that's where this album really shines.  This isn't a perfect album. 9 of the 18 tracks are less than 2 minutes and seem like mere sketches of something that could have been great if they had been developed into full songs with vocals.  The best songs here are the longer ones.  ""It's What We Do"", ""Sum"", and ""Talkin' Hawkin'"" are highlights, and ""Louder Than Words"" (the only song with vocals) is a nice way to end the album.  As for the bonus material on the blu-ray disc, it's not particularly interesting, or something I'd likely revisit a lot.  A lot of black and white footage of PF jamming in the studio, interspersed with old photos.  No behind the scenes documentary or interviews with Gilmour or Mason about the making of the album.  Although there is one song on the audio section called ""Nervana"" which is really good and really rocks out.  I'm not sure why this wasn't put on the album.  So overall, a very good Floyd album, though definitely not a classic.

2967,109368,5,2.0,False,"05 24, 2015",AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00TQTE8UE,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Anonymous Andy,"When Faith No More disbanded in 1998, its members all pretty much hated each other. That sort of contempt seethes out of just about every single note played on the band's then-swan song, 1997's ""Album Of The Year"" (an effort that arguably benefited from all the inner turmoil). At the time of their breakup, the tide was truly turning, as bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit were beginning their short-lived domination of rock music and the alternative scene seemingly had no use for such a quirky band (Primus, another oddball act from the same era, experienced a similar problem). As the years went by, it became harder and harder to imagine we'd ever hear from Faith No More again. Thankfully, their legacy remained intact and as the legend grew with each passing year and desire for new music continued to swell, the band re-emerged (sans Jim Martin) in 2009 for a string of reunion shows, albeit without promise of new music being recorded. So when it was announced last year that the band would finally be releasing new music, it seemed that said album would be an instant lock for 2015's Album Of The Year.  Well, the year isn't even half over, but with ""Sol Invictus,"" Faith No More have certainly crafted what will inevitably be one of the most exciting rock albums released this year. 18 years between albums has done little to squash the drive and creativity that is a hallmark of the Faith No More name. Not only does ""Sol Invictus"" stand head and shoulders with the finest rock music being produced today, it also sits comfortably alongside the band's already legendary repertoire. With Jon Hudson once again taking over on guitar from the elusive Jim Martin, the guys have somehow managed to re-ignite that spark the eluded them oh-so many years ago. ""Sol Invictus"" is crunchy, energetic, bold and adventurous.  First and foremost, it's nice to hear Mike Patton singing again in this context. While the years have proven him to be a versatile artist who can't be nailed to one genre, Faith No More is his true home. And while he supposedly recorded his parts at home and in his pajamas, he sounds just as inspired to be here as the rest of the guys. The juggernaut rhythm section of Mike Bordin and Billy Gould throbs and pummels its way through the 10 sweet but brief tracks that make up the album, allowing room for Hudson to exercise some truly thrilling guitar heroics (echoing some classic moments from the Martin era without aping that style) and keyboardist Roddy Bottum to add just the right touch of class or weirdness, wherever either is needed.  The album opens with the title track, which finds carnival barker Mike Patton dipping into the water with ease before the band plows into ""Superhero,"" a glorious rocker that sounds like ""The Real Thing"" on steroids. ""Sunny Side Up,"" another track that plays to Patton's strengths, recalls the casual, almost sarcastic delivery that made ""Angel Dust"" such an odd and engrossing listen back in the day. By the time we reach ""Separation Anxiety,"" the band has had enough time to stretch its legs and really find its groove. Another rocker, this track allows each member of the band to shine, though Hudson finally earns his moment in the spotlight. A somewhat divisive track, ""M*****F*****"" finds Bottum on top, taking over lead vocals for one of the album's weirdest diversions. When this song was released as a tease last year, it didn't really set the world on fire. In the context of the rest of the album and with enough room to grow, it becomes one of the band's most intriguing tracks.  All told, ""Sol Invictus"" clocks in at just under 40 minutes. It's an efficient and thrilling knockout of an album. Few bands come back from the dead and make music that is relevant to the times while fitting into their past, but Faith No More have knocked this one out of the park (and then some). In a world where everyone from Pixies and The Replacements to Coal Chamber is putting out new music after so many years of silence and against all odds, Faith No More have become superheroes of a certain type. ""Sol Invictus"" will not only quench your thirst for new Faith No More, but it will also rock your face off in unapologetic fashion. Proving once again that there is no age limit in rock n' roll, Faith No More have more than rewarded our faith in them.",Album Of The Year,1432425600,,dust sarcastic manage brief legend ever say jim release legendary aping room tease time rocker quench last many thing certainly oddball benefit juggernaut song knock seem divisive clock really jon park right passing odd energetic home type album's patton almost would hear track primus ago casual finally water become diversion band context carnival repertoire crunchy release show either earns set record without alongside alternative year tell do note every glorious desire thrill bold much eluded effort drive rock open echo like pixy pajamas vocal then-swan martin section come hallmark take shine recall creativity listen title everyone can't turmoil contempt experience name limit craft problem sans today thirst wherever lock one remain new make intact string engross bizkit sweet become first turn certain band barker time rhythm imagine top also prove limp year fashion inner side scene reach put album moment throb sunny patton's style invictus classic though gould supposedly allow plow bordin sits allow hated nice instant foremost play use head artist genre fire seethe comfortably true half m*****f exercise re-emerged grow billy bottum korn enough anxiety versatile member legacy faith hard chamber act steroids shoulder groove spotlight go sol music re-ignite play little dead face back relevant intriguing similar single finest nail squash produce part odds hudson separation we'd somehow find quirky make reward begin seemingly oh-so short-lived roddy superhero weird well another angel stand age member track heroic continue ease find somewhat arguably way dip coal add guys world moment breakup knockout spark domination roll disband already minute real albeit stretch grow swell touch need delivery elusive strength efficient unapologetic replacement pummels sound inevitably sing adventurous truly keyboardist weirdness sort album excite promise prove reunion even rest lead day guitar class tide mike become band's superheroes inspire fit past leg thankfully announce silence era pretty

Lyrics: The reason why I stand The answer lies in you You hung to make me strong Though my praise was few When I fall and bring your name down  But I have found in you A heart that pleads forgiveness Replacing all these thoughts Of painful memories But I know That your response will always be  I'll take you back always And even when your fight is over now Even when your fight is over now I'll take you back always And even when the pain is coming through Even when the pain is coming through I'll take you back  You satisfy this cry Of what I'm looking for And I take all I can And lay it down Before the throne of endless grace, now That radiates what's true  I'm in the only place That erases all these faults That have overtaken me But I know That your response will always be I can only speak With a grateful heart As I'm pierced by this gift Of your love  I will always bring an offering I can never thank you enough  You'll take me back always And even when my fight is over now Even when my fight is over now You'll take me back always And even when my pain is coming through Even when my pain is coming through You'll take me back always  Even when my fight is over now You'll take me back always Even when my pain is coming through You'll take me back","Great, as usual for Jeremy Camp",1435017600,,fall know lyric painful hung i'll thought memory lie true one pierce name enough take great camp throne song pain find really replace love j.c.'s back overtaken place answer speak reason grateful good satisfy cry offering number full album heart what's gift response great even thank lay make never bring forgiveness i'm endless come though fight radiates jeremy always another strong era look fault praise pleads grace stand
