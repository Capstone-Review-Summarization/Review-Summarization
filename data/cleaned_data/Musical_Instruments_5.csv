I've been playing bass since the days when all we could get were flat-wound strings in the early 60's. Back then, the strings were mostly pretty dead and lifeless sounding, with poor sustain, and uneven tones.  I was happy to switch to round-wounds when they became available.  Thing certainly have changed.  These Chromes sound really good, and different in some important ways.  They have a nice added fullness in the midrange (relative to round-wounds) that I really love, and have missed with round-wounds, but the nice thing is, they do NOT sound dead like the flats of old.  Been there, done that.  The notes are all even, the sustain is as good as it was with round-wounds.  I have about 14 basses in my collection.  There will always be a place for round-wounds on some of my basses for some kinds of tunes...everyone should have some variety, but I'm quite happy to convert at least some of them to these chromes.  It's nice to have quiet slides back on some of my basses...like the old days in that respect. Oh, and my fingers sure thank me after several hours of playing complex licks. Smooth as butter!  BTW, I went with the lighter gauge (40-95) of the Chromes.  Don't be fooled by this...they sound plenty fat and full at the low-end, are easier on the fingers, and require less tension on the neck than the heavier gauges.

37,162947,5,False,"08 13, 2014",ADH0O8UVJOT10,B00I6JGPHY,StormJH1,"I was on the lookout for a very compact, portable, all-in-one practice amp solution for noodling in my office or any other small room around the house I wanted to play guitar in.  As a very amateur - though somewhat experienced - guitar player and wannabe gearhead, I've owned a number of solid state, tube, and modeling combo amps and switched them in and out as my needs and tastes changed.  If you are realistic about the types of sounds that an affordable amplifier of this size can make, then I truly believe the Blackstar ID Core10 is one of the more complete practice amp solutions imaginable.  Let's get a few things out of the way.  First, the size...this thing is SMALL.  Stand a ruler up on your desk.  The Core10 is slightly shorter than that ruler, and maybe an inch wider.  It weighs all of 9 pounds and comes with a detachable shoulder strap/carrying handle.  Chances are that your guitar weighs 7 to 10 pounds, so if you can carry it, you can carry the Core10 as well.  It's also pretty uniformly ""square"" in shape, so you could slide it onto a shelf or into the corner of a closet and hide it quite easily.  The phrases ""bedroom amp"" and ""practice amp"" get thrown around interchangeably with no uniform meaning.  For comparison, I have a Fender Super Champ X2 in my basement.  It's a $350 15 watt tube/hybrid modeling amp with a 10 inch speaker, and it probably weighs around 20 pounds.  The Blackstare ID Core10 has two 3"" speakers that are 5 watts each (total of 10 watts of power).  There really is no practical way that you could consider the Core10 a ""performance"" amp.  My Super Champ X2 is probably about the smallest size amp you would consider even for a smaller venue (unless you mic it up), and even then, you would probably opt for a tube amp or something with a bigger speaker.  So if people log on here and post 1- or 2-star reviews complaining about the lack of low end - just keep in mind: they bought the wrong amp for their purposes.  But the most important question about the Core10 is ""How does it sound?!""  I'm thoroughly amazed by the quality and variety of sounds that this little solid state modeling amp puts out.  For something that costs 100 dollars, keep in mind that not even 15 years ago, amateur players like me would freely pay 2 or 3 times that price for a multi-effects processor, which would be about the same width as my Core10.  They would then hook that up to whatever crummy solid state amp they could afford (Mine was a Crate GX10...yuck), and you'd have one complicated, relatively expensive, and still poor-sounding gear.  The $100 Core10 assembles amp/speaker modeling, effects, and speakers all into the same box, and it sounds worlds better than that big red POD you were proud of in the late 90's.  The limitations of a set of 3"" speakers are obvious, but the sound very ""full"" without necessarily being deep.  But the Core10 seems to avoid two key annoyances that plague most solid state amps with 8"" or smaller speakers: (1) Unwanted rattling; and (2) Speaker breakup/distortion.  In fact, as much as I love my Vox Pathfinder 15 (a now discontinued solid state amp revered for it's affordable tube-like sound), the Core10 seems able to be pushed closer to its limits without degrading sound quality.  The secret may be in the ""stereo"" nature of having two small speakers side by side.  This is particularly noticeable with the addition of reverb, delay, or chorus.  The Core10 has 6 ""voices"", which are kind of like different amp models: Clean Warm, Clean Bright, Crunch, Super Crunch, OD1, and OD2.  I had a Strat and Les Paul-style guitar alternately plugged into the Core10, and it handled both quite well.  On some settings, the Strat can get a bit bright, but the guitar's tone knob can help that.  None of the settings were muddy and unusable, though, and it really does simulate a ""cranked"" larger tube amp sound at lower volumes.  One controversial feature may be the ""ISF"" control, which stands in lieu of a traditional tone knob.  The ISF does affect equalization, but not in the traditional way.  At ""0"" it has more of a Fender/US sound, and blends all the way to ""Marshall""/UK at ""10"".  At first, I was quite alarmed that there was no way to tame the high end with a simple roll-off control.  But, realistically, the 3"" speakers probably don't push enough air for the difference in low end/high end on a simple tone control to even register.  You will find that the different voice presets have sweet spots that may also vary based on your guitar.  Add/subtract gain and volume, and you'll get close enough to where you want to be.  The ""Clean"" settings do a convincing Fender tube amp at low volume.  Crunch is bright with some tube-like breakup (similar to a Vox), and the three higher gain settings could be part Marshall, ""Brown Sound"", Soldano, depending on your opinion.  It all sounds surprisingly good.  While the EQ could have been handled better, the effects suite is brilliantly conceived.  I can't tell you many modeling amps costing many times more than this one force you to use one or two effects at a time (and usually in the combinations that they pick).  On the Core10, reverb (which is always on for many players) has its own control button, which can be run separately with modulation (chorus, tremolo, etc.) and delay.  You really have everything you need in this one little box to approximate just about any guitar sound you can reasonably think of.  No, it wouldn't sound as good as a 30-pound tube amp, but that was never the point.  Some final notes: the amp is powered by an external power supply, which is a round plug cable into a box, and out into a wall plug.

However, I should give this NO stars for goofing around too much: this is the sixth revision of the Humipak, according to my luthier. The previous revision was total disaster. I bought one, and could not reinstall the bag of humidifying resin on the spine (like a report cover spine.) And I was not alone in this, even the luthier said he couldn't and he's a strong guy and I'm a senior citizen woman. So it wasn't just me. So IF YOU HAD the previous rev with the spine you slid  (maybe, maybe not) across the bag, this is NOT like that anymore.  The new revision has saddlebags attached by a ribbon handle. You slip the humipak inside the bags, no closure and stuff it inside your soundhole. (It barely fits in mine, I have a classical guitar. (An acoustic steel guitar will fit it better, they tend to have larger soundholes.)  There is a third bag for the headstock area of your guitar case.  Does it work? Yeah it works. I know it works because I ran a test to see if it works (once an engineer, always an engineer.)  And it works better than the sponge-type containers that you moisten (daily) and put in the soundhole. Those do not diffuse the water evenly into the guitar body. I know this because my guitar got overly dry EVEN WITH constant use of that device. I ended up taking it in for repair and rehumidification and meanwhile, the second guitar at home was given this new humidifier  (because you need a spare, you can see why: the one is at the shop and you're playing the other.)

While the Humiditrak is not a super sensitive device, I'm told it's within 3% and it tracked an immediate increase in humidity. The sponge device stayed at a much lower level of humidification. The guitar got up to 45% humidity and then started to drop again when I turned off the humidifier in the room, so now I know:  1. Use the Humidipak 2. Humidify the room you keep the guitar in, and play in constantly. I use a cool mist humidifer.

I've played the piano for over 45 years and have played everything from a spinet to a grand. My complaints about the Alesis are the touch, which felt too hard and plasticky, almost like the toy keyboards you give a child, and the lack of sustain. Those were the deal breakers for me - the odd touch and lack of sustain. I have owned several keyboards - two Ensoniqs and one Yamaha P200. While the Yamaha P255, is considerably more than this Alesis, I placed my order and know I will love it. My only other complaint, and this would not have been a deal breaker, but you cannot individually control the volume of the voices. For instance, I like to layer piano with strings, with piano being louder than the strings. On every keyboard I've played, this was a feature that was adjustable. On the Alesis, it's not. It's one volume for all voices.  I think this keyboard would be fine for someone just starting out, but for someone whose played for years, I just don't think it's a good fit - at least it wasn't for me.","I really, really wanted to love it",1505001600,2.0,"{'Configuration:': ' Digital Piano Only', 'Style:': ' Hammer-Action Keys'}",,give know breaker hard play i've keyboard reboxed feature like order complaint piano song someone fine think individually least high hope several voice instance unbox considerably whose ensoniqs place sustain one complaint touch love back deal odd plasticky own good setting child fit lack cannot almost yamaha would everything felt year sent volume adjustable play grand two keyboard layer louder breaker alesis spinet every toy start string control

82,92802,4,True,"06 27, 2014",A5O4ZXR93UBKG,B0010K6TXQ,Mark,"This is a June 2014 review.  Me: I am an avid audiophile. I know what good speakers driven by a class A vacuum tube amp can produce. That's the gold standard for this review.  I went into it on a budget and with eyes wide open, didn't have $500 or more to spend on an amp, especially an amp that would promise ridiculous wattage and not deliver.  This replaced an expensive name brand home theater amp that was supposed to be a 750 watt unit but really only delivered a tiny fraction of that per channel.  I believe from the other reviews complaining about fan noise and such that I might have got a new and improved model of this amp...  I have a Pyle 40 and another 15 watt per channel stereo amp that cost peanuts and have stood the test of time.  First - my purpose was to drive a couple good speakers from the 70's rated at 160 REAL watts continuous and 500 peak, to comfortable room filling volume - both for musical use and as a public address system on occasion at our business. I wanted clean sound and a lot of it, but for me a clean REAL 100 watts per channel would be plenty.  Next - this pup's a commercial unit - so it has NO RCA connectors. You'll need an adapter cable to hook up to a source. Either phono or XLR to RCA.  Next - there's only really one input and no mixing. So for one source, one set of speakers, you're good. Otherwise you'll need a mixer or some similar device to select inputs.  The results: I got a clean two channel stereo output feeding it with a clean input.  I'm using 8 ohm speakers with success, and I can't relate experience on 4 ohm - but I'd probably not try running 4 ohm speakers with this thing based on my sense of what it is, and the other reviews.  As for power output, 1000 Chinese watts is equal to a claim of 500x2 watts at 4 ohms is equal to 250x2 at 8 ohms, says the ad.  Reality: with speakers rated at 8 ohms, and half rated power, the thing will probably be longer lived.  Sound wise, at full clean output (clipping light on the amp flickers maybe once in 10 seconds) it sounds and feels like a good clean 75-100 watts should with those speakers.  In years gone by I've driven them with 500 watt per channel vacuum tube amplifiers, and the feel is about right for 75-100 watts.  Provided you don't plan to use the 4 ohm speakers, provided you don't plan to hook it up and let it rip full power regardless of the distortion, provided you don't plan to treat it like a crazed teenager - and provided it doesn't commit suicide all by itself - it works fine.  The amp I got is clean sounding, the fans only come on at higher power levels, are they are inaudible against any reasonable musical material except for something with periods of dead silence. Even then, not all that bad. Those listening to the system have said ""what fan?""  Out of the box, no hum, no surprises. Do plan to turn it down before turning it on or off.  Upshot: Good as anything I've heard since the early 90's, if your intention is to run real speakers at decent volume with enough headroom to sound right.  If taking your chances for under $100 in the hopes of hitting the jackpot appeals to you, you have come to the right place.  Oh, and it has no UL approval or any other approvals I can see.

Fritz,"The Focusrite iTrack Studio Lightning Complete Recording Package for iPad, Mac and PC wasn't quite complete and should have been more impressive than it was. True, there are things to like. The audio recording quality is quite good, it comes with a decent condenser microphone, there are inputs and separate channels for your mic and musical instrument and the preamp is well built and appears to be durable. There is a 48-volt supply (switchable) included for condenser microphones and you can elect to monitor the audio in real time as it is recorded.  The Focusrite iTrack Studio includes a microphone holder that can be attached to any standard microphone stand. The holder has a European adapter screwed in and that adapter must be removed in order to use the holder with U.S. stands. The instructions sheet fails to mention this.  The Focusrite iTrack Studio is not powered from your Mac, PC or iPad. Thats good news especially for the iPad because it cuts down on battery drain. The instructions state that an Apple power supply must be used to power the Focusrite iTrack Studio. That is entirely correct. The Focusrite iTrack Studio does not come with a USB supply (although it should) and the USB power cable won't fit into a traditional USB power supply. (So the Mac USB power supply port isn't really using a USB port after all. Who knew!)  The manual suggest that the Airplane mode be used with the iPad  meaning that the Focusrite iTrack Studio cant be used with FaceTime or other iOS Internet media apps. Sure enough, FaceTime failed to recognize the device even though it was connected to my iPad Air. Instead FaceTime reverted to the internal iPad microphone and speaker. Thats a pity as the Airplane Mode wasn't necessary for iPad Air. The iPad Air had no trouble keeping up with the Focusrite iTrack Studio and its app even without Airplane mode.  Registration (to get the software) didn't exactly follow the directions in the instructions. However, the Focusrite web site walks you through the process. Registration requires both the device serial number (located on the bottom of the iTrack Solo) and the Bundle Number (printed on a separate sheet and included in the box.)  It was the software that was my biggest disappointment with the Focusrite iTrack Studio. There is no CD or DVD enclosed with the iTrack Studio. Everything must be downloaded from the Focusrite web site or from the Apple App Stores (iPad and OS X.)  I had no problem downloading and installing the Tape App for iPad. However, Focusrite claims to offer a Mac (OS X) application entitled, iTrack Solo  Mac. The Focusrite web site makes reference to the software, but there is no way on the site that I could find to download the iTrack software for the Mac. There is no download link and the Apple App Store (Mac) doesnt have it either. How can you called the device Focusrite iTrack Studio Lightning Complete Recording Package for iPad, Mac and PC  and then offer no software for the Mac.

However, there's a HUGE problem with it- it prevents the connection of an external power supply or battery to the phone, so your recording time will be limited to the available charge on your phone.  If you're trying to use Facebook Live or other livestreaming Apps, which use a lot of phone power, your battery will die before the concert or event ends!  I used it to record a concert last weekend, and I started getting Low Battery warnings on the phone after about 1 hour, so I had to unplug the MV88 and plug in a battery instead, so the end of the concert was recorded in mono (and with lots of crowd noise that the MV88 had eliminated).  It seems that this would be relatively easy for Shure to fix- either by adding a tiny jack for power on the microphone body, or by offering a Lightning extender adapter with an external power input.

Finally made the decision due to trying to control dynamics and even out attack when amp master is cranked. Running the SP as first in my effects chain in front of a Blues Junior NOS, using a Strat w/Texas Specials. I did not expect the tonal aspects of this pedal. As a clean boost, this pedal makes my amp sparkle. Beautiful full, super clean tone with just the right amount of breakup for pick attack.  Very solid and well built little unit with very good loocks. When you crank either knob, the noise floor is amplified; I think this is more of an issue with equipment noise, not the SP. The manual specifically points this out, so if you hear people complain about noise, it might not be a fair assessment. Important to know that it's very easy to dial in the noise by adjusting the knobs. I've been able to get the tone I want with no noise at all.  Compressor evens out dynamics and adds sustain. I prefer the mid-compression toggle selection. Haven't played with the internal dip switches that affect attack. Not interested in this level of refinement right now. Enjoy playing with the volume and blend knobs -- so many great tones.  Not usually into pedal aesthetics, but this is a sexy piece of kit. The LED shines through the translucent knobs and looks like eye candy. Only issue is that it's so thin it can tend to tip to either side with the weight of cables. Haven't been able to velcro it down yet. Only play in bedroom and cannot give feedback on stage worthiness.  This is definitely going to be an always-on pedal. So glad I bought this.

Walczak,"As a person who's been playing for over 30 years and has an even dozen Strats currently in the arsenal, I can say this is a decent product for the money.  As others have suggested, the saddles alone are worth the price and the bridge plate and the quality of the chrome plating are decent as well.  If I have any niggle at all, it's the block.  Ok, let me say here that it -IS- a definite improvement over the blocks that came on the Mexican Strats in the 90's and early 00's...that same half-sized block that comes on many Squiers.  If your Strat currently has one of these, you will notice an immediate improvement in tone and sustain.  Like others have said, I too feel that next to pickups, upgrading a Strat trem is probably the best investment you can make in your axe.  Aside from the block obviously being heavier, the bridge plate itself is also thicker and the saddles and screws are very high quality...all of this contributes to better tone and better sustain.  That said however, this just isn't a steel block either.  If you're looking for truly significant upgrade to your Strat, along with this bridge, you may wish to spend the extra $20 to get a GFS steel block, if not an extra $70 for a Callaham (still not sure what they do differently other than ""cold rolled steel"" but the Callaham blocks ARE worth every penny!).  That said, while I haven't tried one of these bridges with a Callaham yet (beyond the stock bridge on my '96), I do have two of these bridges with the GFS blocks...they bolted right up without any problem.  The heavier zinc blocks make pretty decent paper weights :-)  While somewhat subjective, I will also say that these make wonderful replacements for older Mexican Strats as well.  Ok...I'll admit it...I have a chrome fetish and I just do NOT care for that ""relic/road worn"" look where everything is all rusted out.  I've forked out quite a bit of money for my instruments over the years and I like to keep them looking as good as possible...and it just ain't cool if the chrome don't shine!  If you're like me and really want your axe to look good, that $20 is well worth the elbow grease of trying to bring back old saddles and rusted plates.  Since I have seen a comment or two regarding this, please be aware that these are designed as replacements for Fender MEXICAN STANDARD Strats....they may or may not fit other Strats without modification.  Particularly if you're looking to upgrade a Squier, you'll want to measure your string and screw spacing VERY carefully BEFORE ordering, to make sure this bridge will actually fit.  Some Squiers do use the Mexican spacing (such as the MIM Squier Series) but many do not...while most are still metric, some do have a different screw spacing and some of the older Squiers from the mid-80's (like the Japanese E-series) even use vintage American spacing.  Don't assume that just because it's metric, that it will actually fit the axe if it's something other than an MIM Standard.  So over-all, this really is a decent upgrade for an older Strat and well worth the money, however I'm knocking one star off my review because of those zinc blocks...if they were to charge a couple dollars extra and include a steel block, they'd be a MUCH better value.",Great for the money...,1402444800,3.0,,,japanese heavy measure callaham chrome admit much person cold i've use quite star saddle investment somewhat dollar fork regard notice strat who's come like say value however extra fetish mexican pickup significant shine knock actually blocks...they product contribute vintage suggest others squiers order penny next elbow mim differently get high upgrade instrument many arsenal screw grease problem sure something please strats....they different steel feel immediate money trem obviously gfs e-series well weight bolt ok sustain charge see really metric one series quality back aside dozen currently improvement right american replacement string let try beyond good subjective probably worth worn they'd couple truly fit strats come price bit want cool alone early ain't thicker spend relic/road particularly over-all comment plat standard everything carefully paper also ok...i'll not...while decent still bridge plat possible...and even block niggle upgrade roll blocks...if it...i include year aware modification space quality...all make fender bridge either design definite bring play stock i'm since best two block axe yet along old try without look zinc screw wonderful squier rust half-sized assume tone well plate say every may older look keep wish care pretty review

You turn it on and it automatically pairs when you open the app. There is no going into settings to find it and pair everytime, at least with my iPhone.  The app is very easy to use and has a unique simple design.  The roadie itself feels of somewhat cheap plastic, and it is very light, but it has been holding up for me so far.

Since my purchase, I have used this mic for one live show and one home recording. I have an array of other brand name mics that are either the same price or valued at nomore that $100 or so bux. This mic out preformed all except the alesis and audix mics I got. It was equal to their sound however, the weight of this thing makes it feel very heavy duty. The switch on this one is also alittle above average compared to the other mics, as this one looks like it might last alittle longer. Samson and Behringer make pretty affordable mic packs that come in sets of 3 for around $60 to $70 bux, but I can tell you from personal experience that they won't last you longer than a year, especially if you gig every week or so. Recording with this mic was crystal clear and highs and lows were more then sufficently heard. This mic is hotter then a Shure mic and made just as well but - when compared to a Shure, I think this mic has a voice of its own. Highly recommend it - for the cost you won't find a better mic. If you want a better mic, you'd probably have to look in the $100 range and up. For running sound, you can't beat it - for recording, it holds it own.  UPDATE: 05/26/2014  After almost four years with this mic, its still sounds fantastic. I have dropped quite a few times and it still works like a champ. When I run sound almost everyone notices the difference in the clarity and volume of this mic compared to the other mics I have. I will add that you will find a better mic then this but it won't be under $100 bucks or even $150. It makes no sense for a gigging musician to waste that amount of money.

I then shake out the excess water and   blow on each hole for 30 seconds or so, to be sure all the water is out of the reeds.  Dry overnight and play   the next day.  I'm not what you would call a hard rocking blower, so I don't tend to put too much stress on my  reeds. Even though I play at least once every day. I must say the Bluesmaster has the sweetest sound, ease of playing and bending, plus a clean design that   doesn't put stress on my lips or tongue and never have a bad taste.  I highly recommend these to beginners.   Take good care of these little beauties and they won't let you down.  My thanks to Suzuki for making such a fine  instrument.

363,221403,5,True,"06 2, 2015",ADH0O8UVJOT10,B00BPQARTM,StormJH1,"I purchased the Jensen Jet Falcon 10"" (8 ohm) speaker to see if I could upgrade the sound of my Fender Super Champ X2, which is a $350 hybrid tube/modeling amp.  The stock speaker in that amp is a Fender Special Design 10"", and it is by no means ""bad"" at low volumes, but I had story after story about people replacing it and being happy with the change.  However, it seems like the popular replacement speaker for that amp (and many American-voiced 10"" combos) is the Eminence Ragin' Cajun, a super-efficient, LOUD, behemoth with a gigantic ceramic magnet.  What I was looking for was a more nuanced improvement to the stock speaker in the SCX2.  I did want or need the additional volume to play at home, but a slightly fuller tone, less harsh treble, and increased resistance to breakup/rattling were important to me.  After months of research, enter the Jensen Jet Falcon 10"".  The Jet Series is Jensens effort to preserve elements of their classic vintage tones (Jensen speakers were typical of Fender amps in the 1960's), but providing a slightly modern twist with some additional low end response and warmer overall voicing.  This appeals to me also because I have a great love for guitar pedals, so my SCX2 may be asked to cop a Fender tone one day, and then belt out a gainy Marshall riff the next.  THE GOOD: Overall, I have to say that this is an excellent speaker.  If you already liked the tone of your Fender-style amplifier, the Jet Falcon is a fairly ""safe"" upgrade in terms of cost and staying true to the original tone of the amp.  Immediately upon installing this speaker, I noticed a fuller low end - not necessarily in the sub-bass frequencies, but in the lower mids.  I think this is a good thing unless your goal is to try and turn your Fender into a Mesa Boogie with a speaker change, which probably will not be successful.  Jensen also promotes the speaker as having a slightly rounded off high end, and I really like that aspect of it as a Strat & Tele player.  To be clear, the sparkling Fender high end is still there, but the high end is slightly warmer and more musical than the stock speaker.  The Jet Falcon also responds very well to gain - it was loving my overdrive and distortion pedals, and this will probably only improve as the speaker breaks in further.  Installation was a breeze - 4 screws in the exact same placement as my stock speaker and replaced the +/- connections by hand without having to modify anything.  It probably took 20 minutes (or less) to make the switch, and I have very little knowledge of how amps work.  THE BAD: As happy as I was with the tones I described above, one thing alarmed me a little bit and almost caused me to give the speaker a 4-star review...I believe it is quieter than the stock speaker.  Now, for me, this is arguably a positive thing.  Tube and hybrid amps have a better quality tone at moderate or high volumes than they due at insanely low settings.  But many who make the effort to replace the speaker in their amp are hoping for more power, which is why the Ragin' Cajun is so popular in this amp, and I could see them being disappointed with this speaker.  As it is with me, the SCX2 already had more volume than I reasonably could need, not to mention both a ""Line Out"" jack and an extension cabinet output jack, so the Jet Falcon remains plenty powerful for my needs.  Oh, and yes, the Jet Falcon does feature a magical green cone.  Worth mentioning since something like 95% of the speaker cones out there are some version of black or gray.  I think the color is cool and I can't see it through the grill of my amp anyway.  But buyer beware if cone color is a ""dealbreaker"" for you...  The Jensen Jet Falcon is reasonably priced and delivers on classic American-voiced tones, with perhaps just a bit warmth and low end response behind it.  Do not buy this speaker if you hate everything about your Fender or similar amplifier, or if your goal is to be as loud as possible.  Do consider this speaker if you are interested in an affordable quality replacement or upgrade for your 10"" combo or cabinet.","Great upgrade for a slightly more ""modern"" Fender tone",1433203200,7.0,,,player extension power jack champ powerful try buyer upgrade many thing gigantic alarm gainy placement connection oh happy eminence really nuanced resistance sparkle turn original preserve possible exact increase volume yes believe home fuller jensen mesa bit almost version everything bad response treble jet sound volume gray round combo cone special overall combo without beware tele modify provide affordable may replace give knowledge black effort like cop positive cabinet ohm could vintage jensen cost can't modern due screw overdrive element color musical ask well enter cone replace upon one magnet love term behemoth installation instal worth grill hate purchase described buy also still anyway see reasonably mention need appeal since classic story magical breeze behind tube american-voiced tone harsh goal notice low clear voice frequency cajun price additional hand gain work belt hybrid however true amp need mids think successful next aspect important replacement seem change slightly quiet mean ragin output amp respond less fairly little liked series distortion quality improvement super-efficient similar low sub-bass good consider take design perhaps stay tone amplifier plenty fender make hop break typical marshall setting well research say dealbreaker look unless arguably remain speaker strat feature immediately warm twist warmth tube/modeling fender-style delivers high cause something great disappointed already speaker minute pedal interested line safe moderate play replace green popular review...i loud necessarily promote probably super want cool month switch improve riff breakup/rattling boogie loving day guitar insanely stock mention excellent end people ceramic falcon anything

The cello, from a reputable company, came with terrible sounding strings which needed immediate replacements.  Since I wanted to compare my two cellos by equalizing the strings and using the same bow, it made sense to order Helicore strings (FYI my primary cello came with the Helicore).  As stated in other reviews for this product, the strings made a huge improvement in tone and projection on my second cello.  The ""o.k."" cello became a decent one simply by changing the strings.  I was amazed to find that the Helicore strings made that much difference.  Now, I'm really sold on the Helicore strings.  I believe it's worth spending $100 on this set.  I highly recommend it.  Perhaps, you may be wondering how the comparison of the cellos went.  My primary cello (newer but better material) easily won, but my second cello is not too far behind now.  Update (9/15/2013):  Since my earlier post above, I've purchased third cello, and as in the past, I've ordered a new set of Helicore and replaced the strings that came with the cello.  I, of course, played the cello with the original strings first, but they were not good enough for me.  The new set of Helicore made amazing difference once again.  The Helicore strings on the first and second cellos are still performing wonderfully.  I love Helicore, but I am planning to test out a different set of strings next time.  I will write a review, comparing the set with Hlicore.

If you want that, and a normal strat 25.5 inch scale, buy a Strat.  This is for smaller hands, or a smaller person, or a youngster, or someone like I who had broken his left hand.  MIne came set up very well, but I lowered the action, adjusted intonation, which, though some reviewers disagree, was a total breeze.  I changed the strings to 10's which naturally on a short scale guitar, helped the tone.  If you can handle 11's, they would probably be even better.  If you are just starting, stick with the 9's on there.  String spacing is a little close for me, but not unhandelable.  Just remember is is scaled down in all measurements, not just scale length.  I have found it such a good guitar that I invested in new pickups that have this thing singing.  Everyone has their own taste.  There are reasons to get this guitar and there are reasons to upgrade it if you want.  All in all, for $99 you would be hard pressed to find anything better.

I dislike the thumbdrive feature because that technology is outdated. Had bluetooth been included I would have a total love for it.  This is not appreciably louder than the smaller B205D or SRM150, but has truer sound. The extra inch of the speaker is an improvement. In small venues this can also be transformed into a small PA. That can even be expanded by adding additional units (or B205Ds or Mackie SRM150s) using the daisy chain capabilities. Those come from the XLR male 'Through' connection on the back into the combo XLR/1/4"" Main In connection. You can use an XLR to 1/4"" cable to connect the Through to the Main In. You then can control the volumes of each unit through their master volume knobs.  A single one of these works in small venues as a PA (although if it's a small bar, coffeehouse or restaurant I recommend at least two daisy-chained.) For venues that I mainly play - retirement and nursing homes - the audiences are attentive and a single one of these will work for up to fifty residents.  For larger venues these are great monitors that can be connected to a PA by connecting the Through port to the PA's mic or instrument inputs (you can select either on the back of the unit). You can also use this for a single instrument and two mics, for for three mics, then mix and pipe them into a PA (or use this as a small PA). It will also accommodate condenser mics because you can turn on phantom power.  There are no effects, nor is there an effects loop. You can use effects between your mics and instruments and the three inputs on the front, but if you are then sending the mix to a PA there is no way to separate them once they are in the PA's input channel.

461,102903,5,False,"02 17, 2011",A36D1H2EY9J3B5,B001L8KE06,JColez,"***UPDATE: Glad that several like my review, so if you want this amp you better find it, because Fender discontinued it (apparently) for the newer version.  It's no longer on their product list.  This little amp may be costing them money elsewhere!***  I may buy this amps big brother.  Sorry for the interuption, please read on:  I'll spare you my guitar playing resume (30+ years), and get right to it. So, I purchased the Super Champ XD outside of Amazon, but am so impressed with it, I don't mind supporting the other excellent Super Champ XD reviews herein.  After a few weeks of viewing piles of reviews on various effect/amplication items and actually field-testing many amps and interests..  I happened back on my trusty old Fender series of amps. I sat down and played the Mustang 2 first and then the SCXD.  The Mustang 2 was neat, but more for a beginning home-player wanting a full solid state amp with a-bizillion gizmos.  The SCXD is more of a player's amp (for the musician who wants tube-driven warmth with ""modeling"" or ""voicing"" built-ins, manueverability, and ease of use. The expression ""modeling"", or ""voicing"", simply means that this amp has built-in pre-set distortion settings and effects (16 distortions and several effects combinations - chorus, delay, tremelo, Fender spring reverb, and Vibratone - which is a phase-like effect).  And, they are adjustable (gain, and intensity).  As such, you have two different knobs; one which controls your distortions, and the other which controls your effects (there is an intensity knob for the effects too).  The 16 distortions range from very light to crunch, so it's not completely accurate to say that some are all that ""distorted"", but you get the idea.  To add each distortion setting, and effect setting may be tuned to your liking with gain, treble, bass and intensity knobs.  So, this amp is pretty customizable for what it is.  No, it's not a fully customized pedal/effects board.  However, you will admire the versatility of this set-up, and all the many tones it produces.  Plus 15 watts of tube power is a lot!  (Guessing here - similar to a 60 watt solid state amp in power output).  The pre-set distortions are all usable for varying tastes of music.  For hard rock and lead, I use setting 8 (plexi-Marshall) and 3 (Fender, driven tweed) each used with full gain, and higher treble and bass settings.  Go ahead, and add some delay/reverb, or plain delay for soloing..  This setting is great either way.  Or, for a blusey vibe, I'll use setting 2,6, and 7, with/without some temelo..  there are so many ideas and tones you can get out of this amp. The hard-rock distortion is very good and toothy (setting 8).  It's my opinion that setting 8 is an excellent general setting (w/without delay, or verb).  Just adjust your tone and pick-ups with this setting, and you'd be happy, but you've got plenty of others to choose from too.  I also really like to work the tubes on this thing..  Many times, I crank up the volume to a 5-7 level, and the gain all the way up!!  This little thing sings, cries, and rocks.. nice and loud!  All tube amps need volume to do their magic - so, it's no different on this amp..  Testing it in a store on level 2, or 3 is great, but go ahead, turn it up to level 5-7 to get this thing into groove..  If the store will let you do it go ahead and try it (use setting 8 on the voicing knob, and pick out a Les Paul to work this horse).  Or, you got to, take it home for a little while.  The fit and finish are usual Fender-look, and quality.  Everything feels good as you adjust and play with the amp.  I also like that this amp is small/midsized and will stow away without taking up too much space, but, at the same time, deliver fairly rich base response and fat tone (notable with Fender tube amps).  This amp is about the size of an average microwave oven (more boxy though).  The SCXD offers versatility and big sound in a compact package; it is absolutely perfect for home-space playing without all cords/gear/mess that larger amps/stacks/pedals/cords give you.  Could you gig with it?  Hell yeah, but depends on your set-up and other things. The speaker inside the SCXD gives good bass and lush/fat tone; but also will render the crunchy/crispy metal tone too..  This speaker sounds pretty fantastic people..; many have suggested, you've got to break-in a speaker, my stock speaker is getting more edgy after about 100 hours and sounds really good - I doubt I'll ever replace it. I also dig the old-school power-on indicator light.  It glows and looks old-school-cool.  Overall -  I would replace this amp at a higher cost if it were stolen from me.. .  It's like adding 20 pretty good pedals to your small tube amp without all the cords, adapters, mess etc..  Therefore, it's a great home-use amp (plug and play).  Purists argue that modeling/voicing amps (also known as hybrids) are not full-tube sound which is partly true, but you'll never hear a difference.  So, I disagree in context as to how tube sound works to begin with.  As for the SCXD, the sound on both channels is still moving through vaccume tubes, it's just that, the overdrive is processed from transistors, instead of extra tubes which are in ""full-tube amps, therefore making the OD gain in the SCXD solid-state.  This is no different than pros using solid-state pedals to run throuh their ""full tube"" amps (clean or dirty channel)..  It's all snobbery to me..  Don't be fooled, the SCXD sounds tube-wonderful for the price (and the SCXD clean channel; for you purists, is full tube anyway).  Alright.. we move on.. Fender sought out to try and please everybody who is an avid home-playing musician and they'll win-over most with the SCXD (not everyone, but most).  They included settings, tones, and effects which would cover just about everything in general.  Plus, you get the much of the character, feel/sound of a a fully tube-driven Fender.  When I finally tripped into this amp, there were folks who stopped by to ask me which one I was playing out of.  The store was set up with Marshall, Egnater, Tiny Terror, Vox etc.. and, I played them all, and for the money, the SCXD is what I bought - it just sounded the best and I got tubes too! Is it stage worthy?  Absolutely, but please be realistic; you'd have to mic it for large events or club playing. (so, it depends on the stage and intended use - YES, for uses in churches and less sized areas).  There are other amps which have a lot more included effects, but most are solid state, and don't offer the warmth, resonance, and bass response of tube sound.  OK, this amp doesn't have everything, but it has the many commonly used distortions and effects.  The Fender Mustang series, Peavey Vipyr and the VOX + series offer piles more effects, but they don't sound like the SCXD.  The Peavey Tube Vypyr is the only exception here, but I've not heard it live and it's $449..  So, not really price-comparable..  Still, the XD kicks effen a**.  For me, less effects and a better distorition-sound was what I wanted for my money, and I got it with the SCXD.  If you compare the Fender Vibro Champ to this one, beware that it's only 5 watts, and an 8 inch speaker.  The SCXD has a 10 incher, another channel, and 15 watts..  It's plenty loud enough to small-gig (clean or dirty), at an average 300 person church without a mic (in my opinion).  Negatives? none really; are there a few things I'd consider? Well... before I mention any kinda-cons, I paid $243 for this amp (on sale), and it's very hard to argue against it for that little money.  ***Now you can find this amp for $199.00...I must admit, that the preset distortions try really hard, but I can't find my exact sweet spot within them (However, it's fairly close on setting 8 - I wish there were a bit more saturation within this setting).  There are many settings which are very good sounding for most styles/tastes (country, rock-a-billy, blues, jazz, rock, hard-rock, metal, crunch).  As for the SCXD, I would say that in it's size, weight, features, and SOUND-class, there is nothing that will really compare.  No, this is NOT a Fender Super Sonic, or a Hot Rod Deville 212 - both have larger cabinets, with larger speakers and full tube-driven gain (no solid state voicing).  So, with the SCXD, you won't get stage-big, and full tube sound (comparitively) but, what you will get, is big-enough-for-your-house tube sound, with piles of add-ons at a great price.  This is a fantastic amp for intermediate/avid home players, studio guys, or grab and go musicians..  No clutter, no mess - lightweight etc.  Some people upgrade the tubes and speakers..  Perhaps, I'll look into that, or not.  So, if you have reasonable expectations, this amp will really surprise you.  If you're really picky; have space; muscle; and have the coin, spend a lot more and check out the Super Sonic, Hot Rod Deville 212, Blackstar HT, Engl Screamer (which is incredible), or the Mesa Boogie 5 X 50, and a few others I could mention.  These offerings have it all, big tube amp sound with excellent clean, and gain personalities.  Especially the Engl Screamer, Fender Super Sonic or Blackstar HT20, or 40.. Saving my money..  Until then, this will work really really well for most anyone and is at least half the cost of the Blackstar HT 20 (which is a full tube amp, with no voicing, or effects).. You won't be displeased with this purchase - there is an army of folks on the Fender blogs who would likly support my review.  Read-up for yourself.  Please find an excellent You Tube demo of this amp; this guitarist is terrific and goes through the voicings (but doesn't use the effects much).[...]  Now you can find this amp on Ebay for $100-150.  The clean channel alone works great for pedal usage and is very loud!.  Also works great with external cabinets (check ohms before doing this!).",Best small-midsized tube amp on the market - BUY THIS.,1297900800,27.0,,,stage-big alright pick-ups gizmos power go deville vox paul hell personality i've blog offering champ home-space modeling/voicing reasonable built-in ever glad dig player tweed musician heard home-player actually worthy try time edgy boxy get upgrade many thing happen sound-class intermediate/avid make different surprise happy range read stage idea really read-up turn pedal/effects control right exact field-testing let notable large yes muscle comparitively home egnater rock mesa spring effen bit high peavey clutter tube-driven preset version engl brother sale would metal hear mic everything response lightweight model ahead work finally treble context toothy break-in sound idea demo volume either plus pile win-over commonly ohms overall set two support throuh without beware board go knob mustang verb displease may pedal small wish review give effect/amplication tune home-playing away hard move realistic crunch much admit base person rock none dirty sonic save like mess extra level tube-wonderful could character take product usual suggest cost size everyone can't nothing sings add-on several expression within tremelo le effect overdrive voicing club pre-set state money well size rock-a-billy avid ok finish set-up one interuption package stop fool big-enough-for-your-house reverb cost compare sweet give picky blackstar guess accurate amazon first item effect weight cord they'll time purchase watt spend various distort buy etc general also old-school-cool still area anyway spare inside grab year plain amps/stacks/pedals/cords incredible rich stow crunchy/crispy choose terror external playing intensity doubt old though run a-bizillion purist newer tube admire small-gig adjust ask tone pay use delay/reverb cabinet price-comparable elsewhere voice expectation old-school support solid-state nice produce resonance spot play i'll magic channel week use yeah gain work longer country power-on temelo however driven offer hour true event amp sat average simply w/without compact need know half blusey others hot least want folk pro anyone enough i'd take big discontinue render fender-look mean want output bass groove must transistors amps combination less music fairly little thing offer series lot distortion back quality feature tube kinda-cons argue kick similar vibe good consider set use add od fit xd alone purchase mind perhaps get terrific snobbery tone check gig close usage herein hybrid manueverability resume plenty blue adapter fender buy likly adjustable begin stolen interest distortion best move feel/sound look sound marshall setting solo well say delay another difference process ht want look disagree full-tube incher glow apparently lush/fat find ease scxd usable way speaker small/midsized vibratone space vaccume styles/tastes sorry player's customizable add depend everybody guys perfect home-use warmth completely oven trusty impressed church fat inch pick please solid great feel cords/gear/mess speaker distorition-sound clean begin pedal therefore taste vypyr knobs watt include play replace army guitarist live built-ins loud sound exception crank large outside list plexi-marshall sound super update neat price want light full studio ebay fully intend test trip especially horse fantastic vibro saturation vipyr seek church cry customize rod boogie lead musician opinion deliver guitar screamer view never indicator plug with/without review microwave stock like chorus channel phase-like vary instead cover mention excellent partly negative tiny versatility people jazz get coin hard-rock us absolutely store pretty

I have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the DP-008EX on its own terms, pointing out features and issues important to me (mostly workflow-related) as someone who grew up home-recording with analog equipment.  (If you want all the details of the full functionality I'd recommend downloading the manual from TASCAM or a dealer site that offers it.)  Speaking of the manual I found it to be essential, at least at first. There are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy (or better yet downloading a second copy) is a good idea. This is picky but I found the larger size of the DP-03 manual easier to read and handle than the smaller DP-008EX.  I've used software-based DAWs for years and, while I enjoy MIDI recording, mixing, and editing with them, basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when I used analog equipment. I have a one-room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and, aside from PC noise, I miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old MK-II cassette 4-track:  Instant power on, press record/pause, ready-set-go.  Granted, I don't miss the `wall of hiss' that plagued those recordings but I had fun capturing a lot of musical moments.  Using a hardware control surface with my DAW didn't solve the problem - I just find the reality of booting Windows, dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment - especially when recording acoustic instruments.  I hoped the DP-008EX would provide some of that older experience - with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup.  The bottom line for me is: It does and it doesn't.  First some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions:  Size-wise, the difference between Porta and Pocket studios is roughly 11 1/2 x 2 x 8 inches versus 8 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 5 inches. TASCAM doesn't provide a case or cover for the DP-008EX but a larger eReader or tablet case should do fine and I'd recommend one if you plan on portable use - the plastic appears fairly durable but it's still plastic.  The knobs on the DP-008EX are smaller in diameter, lower, and have rounded tops compared to those on the DP-03. However, I find their slightly `rubbery' matte finish just as easy to grip. I also find the smaller, circular pushbuttons on the DP-008EX don't protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar-shaped buttons on the DP-003 and are less comfortable to use.  The data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the DP-008EX which I prefer - the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus.  You'll need the dedicated PS-P520 5v power supply for the DP-008EX; the 12v PS-1225L for the DP-03 can't be shared. (The plug won't fit so you can't fry it - and don't even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously).  On the other hand, the Teac RC-3F footswitch is sharable - you'll need a mini plug to phone adaptor - but I think it's indispensable if you're working alone.  Speaking of power, a strong plus for both recorders (and for me a deal-breaker were it not present) is phantom mic power so you're not limited to the built-in stereo condensers. They're not bad for rough work but, unlike mic stand-mounted portables, it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals. I can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good-sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar (acoustic or electric amp), violin, or percussion I want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics.  I like the resistance of the faders on the DP-03, but I can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the DP-008EX. There's no CD burner either on the smaller unit but with USB 2.0 transfer capability, that's not an issue for me.  Having similar XLR, phono and RCA jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste. I'm not  bothered by it because I have space to run the cables but it's worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you.  The LED screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues:  The flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be - especially since the menu is used so much. A slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble:  I do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at 25 degrees and doesn't interfere with jack access - it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use. TASCAM should consider a similar accessory.  The software is largely the same for both units, aside from additional mastering `tools' (essentially packaged presets), and here lies my major criticism: I feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality (i.e. levels, EQ, arming tracks) with dedicated knobs and buttons, and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what I see is an inflexible, constraining menu  system.  If there were some way to customize the menu navigation (the equivalent of software hot-keys) it's possible the frequent repetition of non-functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do.  The best evidence of an unbalanced design I see is the dedicated Phantom power button on both units whose purpose is - to display the ""Phantom"" screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off! That crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software-based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder.  When space for knobs and buttons is severely limited I can understand the design thinking and trade-offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu. But the DP-008EX is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi-tracker, a Fostex X-15, effectively doubled-up the functionality of two tracks to cover four.  So I have to question whether the trade-offs TASCAM made here in fact diminish the user experience.  With connectivity and software-based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving, I believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the DP-008EX will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience. I think TASCAM would be well-served taking that into account.  I've always liked the design of TASCAM gear; it just looks and feels well-made, and that's still in large part true of the DP-008EX. But I can't help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old MK-II cassette 4-track would satisfy a lot of people out there (and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off!).",Good Quality But Some Awkward Design Choices Like Its Predecessor,1368403200,19.0,{'style:': ' DP-008EX'},,condenser think power jack taste i've consider hiss capture simplicity understand built-in treatment stand-mounted diminish lie select supply inch market edge fine equivalent room doubled-up dealer software get point many slant press tremendous read responsiveness fun recorder electronics deal-breaker position resistance part turn hot-keys setup usb degree audio possible cassette stuff pull large good-sounding believe easy home explore limited ready-set-go diameter home-recording bit violin neck screen miss flexibility would mic track bad protrude response connectivity mics small work mini easily lead idea portastudio experience round main either plus pocket two mk-ii capability system inevitable noise force site circular hardware essential they're may portable criticism phone plastic much porta drive recording enjoy button recorder multi-tracker like i.e vocal estate four character take improve product question tablet bar-shaped can't studio well-served pocketstudio track daw share instrument analog button generation inflexible problem rubbery trouble musical accessory tascam acoustic deal layout mix good acquire size rca hope finish obvious one wall term slant access make account electric point toxic presets distraction compare incorporate likely picky exist worth access first menu solve adaptor lead well-made help time issue cd felt also general constrain decent master still workflow-related see physical user bottom indirectly year phono case one-room believe moment wheel since patch yet old run interfere midi comparison there's basic pushbuttons use always data low selection non-functional second recording instant cable portable menu navigation compromise additional hand use work indispensable recommend offer however hybrid true prefer piano amp need trade-off think package reality next grow unit least important spontaneous upper i'd pc phantom take slightly largely device edit boot whose less find severely fairly repetition like lot image quality back aside rough record/pause similar manual durable good seriously consider satisfy use fit design major whether alone fry terrific present mostly level close top workflow provide size-wise plan recapture step kept versus identical make teac adjustable ereader i'm xlr daw best work equipment roughly along software-based woodworking well unbalanced get difference strong effectively hop look bother control stand look directly read download find gear ask way appear space surface handy grant someone arm moment press rapidly wear footswitch chop creative feel simple feel real unit handle description unlike line faders knobs stereo sharable that's fact conflict tool issue windows functionality compare matte large probably comfortable workout lack transfer crystallize digital copy want full studio frequent jack display position especially accessible speaking challenge even dedicate easy guitar fostex plague purpose integrate eq never plug mount describe customize hack tactile cover mention battery evidence burner make flat detail people essentially minimal old anything percussion grip feature

489,215486,5,False,"05 2, 2012",A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B003V8BE6M,Mike Tarrani,"Many modern snare drums come with snare cord to attach the snare wires to the butt and throw-off (A.K.A. strainer).  However, when upgrading wires some drummers are tempted to use cord for the new set, which may not be necessary. If your strainer and butt have clamps for the cord instead of holes to thread the cord, then I recommend using grosgrain. More about that later.  If you do need cord, this or Ludwig's orange cord are the best two I have tried. If you are installing Puresound wires, which come with stiff, blue cords I recommend tossing them and opting for either this or the Ludwig cords (see this review for why:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PureSound-Blue-Cable-Strings-4-pcs/dp/B004DGI40K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PureSound Blue Cable Strings (4 pcs)</a>.  As I said above, cord is needed on vintage snare drums with strainers like the Ludwig P83 and Leedy 3-Point, but for nearly all modern snare drums ribbon is the best way of attaching snare wires to strainers and butts.  I recommend grosgrain ribbon. In most cases the simple (and inexpensive) replacement of the cord (or plastic snare wire straps) with grosgrain ribbon will result in an immediately noticeable improvement in snare response.  Most plastic snare straps are 3/8"" wide, but I typically buy 5/8"" wide grosgrain ribbon because it perfectly fits almost every modern snare drum throwoff and butt. The thinner, 3/8"" ribbon can cock when threading it through the strainer and butt clamps, skewing your wires. You can purchase this item, in a variety of colors, from Walmart and any fabric store.  If you must use cord, do a search for ""How to Properly Thread Snare Cord"", which should lead you to an illustrated page of instructions at Snare Drum Addict.",High quality cord - but do you need it?,1335916800,8.0,,,"drum case plastic fabric butt use way like immediately wide say thread however recommend puresound come need properly noticeable pcs)</a vintage search throw-off leedy butt grosgrain modern replacement many drummer wire drum simple later opt cable color must a.k.a toss cord tempt thread nearly throwoff strainer page new need improvement illustrate instal strainer instruction perfectly cock cord almost variety skew walmart result purchase why:&nbsp;<a fit blue ludwig item buy inexpensive response thinner see necessary data-hook=""product-link-linked upgrade attach lead addict class=""a-link-normal typically ludwig's either best set two orange hole instead try strap attach stiff wire snare use ribbon every may clamp store string review"

The RE-20 is the venerated holy grail of broadcasting. Creamy radio audio, retro 60s charm.  This mic gives a lot of freedom of movement. With my old Shure Beta 57a mic, I had to be right up on it to sound great. The sweet spot was the size of a plumb. That ended up making my back and neck tense doing a long live show. With the RE-20, the sweet spot is the size of a basketball. I can move all over and sound great. Will extend my life span! (Good for us cranky, creaky old guys. I turn 49 this week.) You can also talk more naturally with an RE-20, it doesn't require conscious or subconscious ""mic technique"" that other mics require to sound really good.  This mic is built like a tank. The RE-20 comes with a 3-year factory warranty. What else in the WORLD comes with a 3-year factory warranty these days??  Available in any color you like, as long as it's green. To be more specific: somewhere between Vietnam-era US military camouflage green and old-school hospital room green.  I skipped the fancy accessories, like the expensive RE-20 specific shock mount ($125) and the RE-20 specific pop filter. A standard condenser mic shock mount and boom arm works fine. And while this mic, more than most, will work fine without a windscreen, a standard cheap foam windscreen stretched over the end makes it sound even better. No need to get the dorky little RE-20 specific pop filter.  Used correctly and with a good pre-amp, the RE-20 is a sword of truth cutting through the murky swamp of media lies and statist COINTELPRO sheeple-bleeting horizontal enforcement of injustice.

But you better have it sitting on a speaker and that speaker turned up pretty darn loud if you want this unit to really do any flashy light show. And even then, don't expect a STROBE affect, because this IS NOT a real strobe light..  if you want a Strobe light in the purest sense. Now, if you want flashing lights activated by sound, this is what your looking for. But a real strobe light leaves trails when you move across a room.. Or wave your hand.. That's old school Strobe, and even those had an adjustment knob to control the speed. This light will not do that. Update to my original review 1 Aug 2016: I came back an added 2 Stars to my original review. And here's why. Although not a true strobe, this light will put off a good light show if you have very loud music playing. Depending on where the unit is placed. I keep it in my guitar (music room)  If the sensitivity knob is turned wide open, and the music is good and loud, especially with a lot of bass, which this is really triggered by, it does give off a pretty good light show. And it is very bright. You still will have to experiment with colors, as there is no way to determine what setting you are on, other than just pushing the button until you get the color pattern you like best. But the louder the music, the more this will perform. Another use for this which is actually pretty cool, is using this behind a large Flat screen TV. Based on the color and sensitivities settings, behind a 55- 65 inch TV, this really adds a lot of special effects to a movie. In particular Sci-Fi movies and such.","Not a true Strobe, but does give a good light show",1459382400,3.0,{'Size:': ' 12 LED 60 Watt RGB Strobe Light'},,give review perform finger move reviewer sensitivity hand find bright use pattern button way strobe darn like come wide depend activated true movie actually sci-fi guess room open next anybody's unit turn get video affect expect press inch sensitivity effect color speaker minimally color real true bass movie well although place box flash music word star put really that's push show here's lot back control original add sense determine leave loud good set speed instruction large tap rgb sit first flashy update light want light lead across school cool screen add especially trigger sequence particular top wave experiment still even adjustment tv guitar sound trail show special play best old louder come life pure behind flat setting knob well push use aug show another base look keep pretty control

Lying the instrument face up on my lap works better, but I still prefer two hands, and it's quite easy to position the capo right where I like it - not flush against a fret but about 1/4"" away - the pressure is still fine and it gives my fretting hand more clearance in 'open' position. I tend to use capos for flatpicking and fingerpicking - and I'll wrap my thumb around to grab the low E string as well, so the extra clearance equals comfort.  Unfortunately this particular capo arrived without the tension screw - and being a review item I can't return it. But I happened to have the same capo in a different color so I did a functional swap. I also have the similar model Planet Waves uke capo - same design but a smaller screw.  The thread radius on the tension screw is nice and gradual and, combined with the rubber coated neck support half, means essentially no fear of gauging the neck with excessive pressure. The main arm rubber is arched - probably about a 12"" radius - but the rubber itself is soft enough to provide even pressure on my OM-1's flat 16"" radius neck. Granted, if you play exceptionally hard (I do not) you may prefer a flatter capo.  The bronze color? Well, the best I can say is it matches the honey-aged tint of my mahogany Martin - but I prefer brass or black.  Bottom Line: Like they say on the highway, easy-off, easy-on.

The AMPLIFi TT is no exception to that legacy. What Line 6 has done with this product is create a very compact amp modeling/effects head, and packed it into a very compact ""play anywhere"" device. You can keep it on your desk, nightstand, or end table, plug your headphones and guitar into it anywhere in your house or office for personal jam sessions or practice without bothering anybody. Or you can plug your studio monitors, computer, and pedal board into it and create a full on studio, all centered around this little box. Do keep in mind that the TT comes with no speakers of any kind - it is basically only a head - but for a couple hundred dollars more, you can buy some very nice studio monitors or an amplifier speaker to plug it into. Or you can just use headphones.  There is an iPhone and Android app that syncs via bluetooth with the TT. It has 100 preset models/effects by default, each of which can be edited and saved via the app on your phone or directly on the face of the TT. You can also search the cloud for other sounds that you can download for free and use in your own ""My Tones"" library.  The AMPLIFi TT is compatible with the FBV Shortboard MkII foot controller and the FBV Express MkII foot controllers. The only downside to this is that there is not very good documentation for exactly how to edit and save tones with your footboard onto the AMPLIFi TT. The manual for my Shortboard MkII doesn't call out the TT specifically, so I'm having to infer certain processes from instructions on how to use the Shortboard with the POD or other Line 6 products. That's a minor annoyance, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.  All in all, I love this product.

Speaking of the headphone port, it actually is designed as a USB sound card, and it will not only work as a monitoring output for the mic, but also will act as a regular audio device.

Before that, it wasn't capable of using the more common dynamic microphones like the SM57 and SM58 without having to really turn its preamp knob to nearly the highest setting, causing a lot of background noise.  I solved this by adding a Cloudlifter CL-1 preamp between the mic and Fast Track Pro, and I've been happy with it ever since.  I have latency issues sometimes, but restarting the sound drivers or power cycling the Fast Track Pro have solved them every time.  I like the results I get when using ASIO4All, versus the included software.  I feel like I have less trouble getting it to work at a lower latency.  It's been a while since I tested both ASIO drivers so I can't give many details.  This interface includes a feature to listen to your input before it passes through the PC, and that helps get past the latency problems of hearing yourself while recording, if you know how to use it.  It's a dirty hack, but it's good enough for me.  If you want to use a dynamic microphone but don't feel like getting another preamp, look somewhere else.  The real pro of this thing seems to be that it works well with a large variety of hardware and software configurations, so that's the reason I made sure to get this specific model.

It is a bit expensive but it works well with so many instruments. It is polyphonic, so multiple notes can be played. It does sound very good.

Well after 40+ years of playing 335's, Tele's, Strat's and, Les Pauls which I have enjoyed very much my mind started taking me back to that Fender Jazzmaster I saw when I was a kid. I started reading reviews, watching video reviews and, checking into what was available. I found that Squire makes this model for a Very reasonable price! I have looked at Squire guitars B4 and, truly I was not impressed but, this one seemed different, Well I ordered it and, I am glad that I did. When this instrument arrived I had my concerns if it would be a keeper or not. Most of the guitars I recieve usually need a decent amount of setup but, all I did with this one was ( lower the action very little, check the intonation ) and, I was enjoying playing a fine instrument! Really can't say if I was lucky or Squire has upped their quality but, my opinion of Squire has been changed. Now granted this instrument is pretty much top of the Squire line and, that could make all the difference but, I've got a keeper. Beautiful sunburst finish and, no flaws can I find anywhere. Several other reviews talked about buzzing, loose bridge screws, strings moving on the bridge saddles and, not staying in tune. I have not had a problem with any of these issues. I am not a heavy handed player, I use thin picks and, light guage strings, maybe that's why I've had no problems.

Also its a 'Vintage Style', not a mid 80's mosquito tone killing device. Not a huge range here. No swooshing jet sounds. Just good 'ol wobble.

The satin finish on the body is what really sets it apart from the glossy versions, in my opinion. It gives the guitar such a better look. The neck feels great. And I mean great. Very smooth feeling when you're playing and running your hand down the length of it. The pickups are ok, I think they are meant to be changed anyway. They do sound great with the right amp though.  The inlays look dope, no complaints there. The head stock is nice too. The knobs are fine, the tone knob gives some variety for your sound, and the volume knob is simply that. No coil tap ability but that's fine. The strings go through the body, as can be seen in the pictures. It's a nice touch, and it does increase sustain. Obviously this is not something to rival the very expensive ones. But with the right upgrades, it has a really good chance to do so. I will definitely be keeping this one.  UPDATE: It has been about 9 months now that I have had this guitar. I still love it. Ended up changing the strings to 11s (Ernie Ball Power Slinky). For metal those strings just work better in my opinion. None of the guitar parts have come loose or apart. The inlays still look good as new. I was a little worried when I first got it that the headstock would break. This is because it is set at a slight angle compared to say a Strat-style guitar. I've traveled around with it in a hard case and softer gig bag, and so far no problems. However, I do treat my guitars as if they are my babies so that plays a big part. I still have no complaints about this guitar. The only thing I would change are the pickups but I get the sound I want by adjusting the amp settings, so it's not a big issue for me.

708,190522,5,False,"11 28, 2015",AWIG50VOI5VUV,B0149J41ZM,AZ gadget guy,I am not new to resonator guitars.  Here goes:  The quality and finish on the body and neck are excellent.  Tuners are fine.  Frets are fine.  Everything is fine.  If you want to play standard guitar.  Sound wise its got the clang to play blues.  BUT it ain't no slide guitar out of the box. The action at least on mine was nice for standard guitar but tooo low for slide.  For one the saddle is radiused to match the fretboard.  Nice for standard guitar but for slide in my opinion I like a flat saddle. (Like you will find on Nationals etc.)  That way the high E string is not below your B and G string.  When the strings are all flat your slide rides on them all the same.  Now you can indeed play slide on it I'm just saying it could be better.  As it sits right now it buzzes all over the place. And the string heights off the 12 fret need to be a 1/16 or tad higher.  Is this an easy fix for a novice?  No way.  In fact most shops have never seen a resonator so in most cases you are going to have to live with it.  You cant take a reso to just any shop.  1. One thing on this guitar they use flat head screws not phillips head on everything.  One slip of a screwdriver by a fumbley tech and you got a nice scratch.  2. Making a reso saddle with proper string heights is a daunting task not like a regular guitar.  3. Gretsch uses a thin saddle whereas your standard reso saddles are a 32nd or so thicker so chalk the idea of just cutting out the stock saddle and working a new one.  If you try you will break the China stuff to junk.  4. The easiest is to order a new biscuit and saddle from Stew Mac and modify it to the heights you need.  Too long to go into detail here on that. But once you get a flat saddle and better string heights this baby rocks as a slide guitar. 5. I will offer a Rube Goldberg solution.  The ebony top of the Gretsch saddle breaks off easily.  Find a piece of ebony or maple and super glue and clamp that onto the top of the maple and go from there.  If you just made all the strings the height of the D and G strings flat you will have a nice set up for slide playing.  You don't need ebony.  National uses just an all maple saddle.  Again this is for the average bear.  You need slot files and a string spacing rule and of course knowledge.  (The photo is of a new saddle I put in mine)  Other than all that this guitar is great for the money.  Its heavy as a tank but its two to three hundred dollars cheaper than its competitors.  I have tried some of the China knock offs and in comparison they are not good for quality fit and finish.  I have not owned the National knock off yet but I have heard they can be hit and miss but for the most part fine but again a few dollars more.

737,121595,5,True,"05 28, 2014",A2MLPTYFG1BKDA,B004SL34IM,Chris G.,"The Irish whistle arrived a day before the first expected delivery date without incident.  It is a musical instrument in the true sense of the words.  Even though it has only six tone holes, like the Native American flute (which requires no embouchure), the Irish whistle plays more like the soprano recorder, even though the recorder has more tone holes. Like the soprano recorder, the Irish whistle requires a fair amount of embouchure to play it correctly. If you can play the recorder, youll be able to transition with relative ease into the Irish whistle.  There are a few caveats, among them: The Irish whistle has a limited number of notes in which to play. They are the natural C, D, E, G, A, B, C# (Db). F# (Gb).  Surprisingly, the fingering for the Irish whistle and the recorder is the same for the natural notes: A, B, (lower D), E and G. You clear the condensation from the Irish whistle the same way you do for the recorder. The soprano recorder cleaning brush is a little too big for the Irish whistle. As to rate it: for how it plays and for what I paid, I give the Feadog Irish Whistle five out of five stars.

I thought about buying a new one, but the ratings on the new version, by a different company are not a good sign. I never used it other than to record directly from it, so quality of head phones never mattered to me. But I did not want to take a chance.  Anyway, this looked like something I might be looking for. It turned out to be exactly what I wanted. Even small adjustments can change your sound. So this is not just limited to those who like to play their guitar with a crow bar. You can go as heavy as you like, or to just enough distortion for a more bluesy sound.

Regarding effects, it has been like moving from the city to a zen monastery. I just need my bass and an amp (and sometimes not even an amp if going DI!). Rather than buy separate pedals for compression, etc. I decided the MS-60B would be an excellent compromise. Using one pedal doesn't hurt the whole minimalist vibe I've been digging within the bass guitar world. Heck, forget the multieffects - this thing has amp simulators, too! How cool is that? One pedal! No rack!  Well, it is too cool to be true.  I can say without hesitancy that there isn't one effect in this pedal I enjoy. Not one. The amp sims I can take or leave, too. It was a letdown. I should have known better, to be honest.  If you're looking to use this live then I can't recommend it. It will suck the tone out of your rig. I can see how some might find it fun to play around with, though, even though the interface is clunky as all get-out. There is no dedicated power switch so if you want to adjust any of the effects you need to pick it up off the floor (so you can see the tiny screen) and power up with a plug placed into the input jack. That's a standard way to power a pedal but with a multieffects pedal you should have a dedicated power option. This assumes that you are using it battery-operated, of course. You can plug it in with an optional wall-wart but then what is the point of a pedal if you have to plug it in to a power source?  It looks like I'll be buying a compression and tuner pedal separately.

It can cover a gamut of tones, from ""new"" tape head to ""vintage"" to ""old"". It also offers low and high pass filters and additional modulation. The tap tempo is a must for the style of music I play (praise and worship) and this tap tempo is very spot on - some that I have tried in the past don't always seem to follow what you tap in, but this pedal really does. What I like about this delay the most is that you can get a really nice wash of tone underneath your playing. I couple this with a reverb (walrus descent, HOF mini, Earthquaker Devices Dispatch Master - not all at once) and it sounds absolutely amazing. Stacking it with a digital delay with a slower tempo after it really adds to the wash. But this pedal is not just for washed out ambient sounds. It sounds incredible with overdrive in front of it as well. So, for lead lines it really sounds great. It also has the option to subdivide your tempo - getting the dotted eight is a nice touch although I use it primarily for the quarter note delay. It does not run in stereo which is not a big deal for me. I run all my gear mono anyway. But if I wanted to run stereo, I would just split the signal with a reverb, so it doesn't really matter.  All in all this is a great delay pedal. Like I said, the best tape delay I have ever heard. Every other tape delay pales in comparison (with the exception of real tape but who can afford that).

At a glance, the Luna appears to be well manufactured.  I could find no flaws in the overall construction.  I will say it is a very attractive ukulele.  The tuning machines work well, though I did find a little play in one of them.  However, I don't consider that to be a big issue.  I played all the frets on all the strings and found no dead frets or buzzing.  Checking the action over the 12th fret with a string hight gauge, I found the action to be nominal (.090"" from top of fret to bottom of strings).  I found the intonation at the 12th to be a little sharp on a couple strings, but it was slight and probably wouldn't be a problem for anyone but the most fussy.  SO the cosmetics, construction and basic mechanics of the instrument are pretty good.  What I noticed when comparing this uke to my Cordoba is the different sound they make.  The Cordoba is brighter and the individual notes are more clear than the Luna when strumming chords.  The Luna sounds muddy to me when I play chords alongside the Cordoba.  I played the two instruments for my son and he said the Luna has more bass.  I also noticed the Luna has more volume than the Cordoba--it's louder.  Plucking individual strings on the Luna was more pleasant than strumming chords, but I'm more into strumming than I am a picker, so sound quality during strumming is important to me.  I'm not certain how I feel about the Luna at this point.  I'm going to play it for a while and see whether it grows on me.  If you're looking for a uke that has more bass, this might work for you.  I don't think it's a bad instrument, but it might best serve those who lean towards that tonal flavor.  I gave it 4 stars because the sound of the instrument didn't knock my socks off.

I put them through their paces and was unable to find ANYTHING negative to say about them except I don't know if I like the green trim....and believeme, I looked. Okay, let me say the reason why I don't like the green trim is because it initially made me not take it seriously...ha! The joke was on me. So, after reading the quick start guide, and I will tell you, this is the best and biggest quick start quide I have seen in a while. It was clear and easy to read and follow. After wiring up the speakers, I connected it to my netbook, computer, ipad, and cell phone. I played a range of music from classical to punk to rap. I threw everything I had at it! The sound that comes out of these CR4 is EXCEPTIONAL....and LOUD! They are so well balanced, that I really didn't have to play around with the tracks. I didn't have to, but I did, and it really makes a difference, especially with music files that might not be that great. That's the only time I got sound that was not that great, but that is the fault of the track. Give it something great, and you will  be amazed. Give it something ok, and it will still sound good, but give it something weak, and well, garbage in, garbage out. The bass is very strong, not over powering or fake sounding, but really perfect and clear. The guide states a range of 75Hz-20kHz (I mention this because the Amazon description states 70Hz). 50 watts of power may not seem like a lot, but you will rock the house with these monitors. The powered monitor weighs in at 7.1lbs and the other is 4.6 lbs. Dimensions are 8.8x6.1x7.3inches....bookshelf sized.....but NOT bookshelf quality! These are solid.

When the levels are at zero there is some slight bleeding, but the options included in this mixer are great for the price. If you are just starting out with advanced audio setups this is the mixer I'd suggest. The EFX processor isn't the greatest, but they're effects none the less. You can output lines separating using Send1 and Send2 (Red and Orange Knobs), however Send2 also uses the EFX, so if you're going to use them it only have one separate output from the Main. Another nice feature is being able to hear your muted lines. When you mute a line it actually switches it to ALT 3-4, so you can listen for reasons to unmute. If you have the money for a higher grade mixer from Mackie or Allen&Heath they will have much better quality and will last longer. The only reason I'd stick with this is if you're just starting out.

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation.  For the money you are getting a moderately good sounding yet somewhat fragile wireless microphone system that will work well for casual use.  Included is a transmitter, receiver, handheld microphone, lavalier microphone, 2 earphones (one of which has an inline microphone) and a short connecting cable that is used to connect the receiver to your camcorder/mic input. The transmitter has a plastic clip on its back and that makes it possible to clip it to a pocket. The Receiver has a Hot/Cold Shoe mount with a tripod mount thread as well. If your camera does not have a hot/cold shoe, you can always get a stabilizing handheld camera grip which generally will have a cold shoe mount as well as a nice platform to attach your camera/camcorder.  The microphones are not directional so will pick up nearby sound quite readily. You need to take that into consideration.  The Transmitter and Receiver each use 2-AAA batteries for power and there is no option to use external power. Battery life is about 3.5 hours for the transmitter and 4 hours for the receiver. It's always a good idea to have extra, fully charged batteries on hand ready to go if needed.  The low-cut filter on the Transmitter and Receiver works as expected.  Range is quite variable depending on the room or space that you are in and the number or type of obstacles in between the transmitter and receiver.

After six months, the sound is a bit less bright and the sustain is somewhat damped.  This probably is a result of dirt and some perspiration associated with playing.  Since I have not played professionally in many years, I do not change strings as often and such accumulation of contaminents is more likely.  My favorite strings (Ernie Ball Slinky Cobalt Strings) have remained brighter with much less diminished sustain even though they have been played more over the same time period.  Also, the cobalit strings were noticably louder when first installed and have remained louder over the same period.  This volume difference provides the cobalts with an increased sensitivity.  In fact, I really cannot notice any material deterioration of the cobalt strings.  While a choice of strings is very personal for an accomplished guitarist, I believe others would generally find results of this comparison similar to mine.  Accordingly, I have rated the D'Addario strings with 4 stars because they are quite good, but I have to give the Ernie Ball cobalt strings 5 stars in comparison.

I was considering buying a wedge monitor to hear myself better, but after researching this and the other Rolls gadgets, along with the ART and Behringer ones, decided to buy this one. I'm thrilled that I did. Wasn't sure about the extra cost for the added line input, but thought it would come in handy for a click track or anything else I might want to do in the future. I got to try my setup at rehearsal and the results were awesome. I was able to sing my parts with so much more confidence and accuracy just from having my own voice right in my ear. I paired these up with a pair of MEElectronics M6-CL-MEE Sport Noise-Isolating In-Ear Headphones with Memory Wire (Clear) from Amazon for $20 (also VERY happy with those, highly recommend!)  In my setup I run my Sure SM58 into a TC Helicon doubler pedal and then into the PM351 (with a really short xlr jumper cable I also got on Amazon). From there it goes into the board. For rehearsal, I did not use a monitor send back into the PM351 but will try that at my next gig. I plug a mini-jack headphone extension cable into the PM351 and plug the in-ear monitors into the extension to give myself room to get funky. The ear buds have nice memory wire and run over the ears and down your back. They have a little clip that I clip on the back of my shirt collar. Wireless in-ear monitors are awesome on TV and for rock stars, but after careful consideration, I realized that 90% of my gigs have stages so small that I barely get to giggle around much at all. Having a thin cable running to the PM351 is no worse than my bass guitar's cable. And they both run to my pedal board in front of me so it's not a hassle at all. I have all my effects velcro'd down on my pedal board for ease of set up. (It will also run on 9 volts from my One Spot)  The PM351 is very load and I had to turn it way down. I also only used one ear bud since we don't mic everything in rehearsal. Just having my own voice in my one ear at just the right volume was a huge help with my singing and i know the gigs will be that much better just from that. The TC Helicon (I love!) helps thicken up my backup vocals and sometimes I use the Octave Up setting that can be hard to sing with without hearing yourself clearly. With this setup I can nail the right note and octave and hear exactly what is coming out of the TC Helicon. This is all WAY better and cheaper than lugging around a wedge monitor. Our drummer is also going to get the exact same setup I have!

The unit's plastic construction isn't a problem for me - I don't gig. Works fine with no noted PSU noise (no hum/buzz/60Hz...) from my pedalboard power supply.  I've been fiddling with it for a few months, and it just doesn't have a sweet spot. I don't like it enough that I ever want it on.  You can get short-delay doubling, but the control the delay-time knob gives you is not fine enough to get it just right. You can max it out to full delay and it sounds not so much like a large hall as it does a cheap pedal. That and I'd like about twice the maximum delay out of this thing. C'mon, charge $5 more and make it more useful.  When I engage this thing, whatever clarity and bite I had seems to disappear - not just due to reverb muddying things up; that I expect - but the original and delayed sounds just don't seem to retain the clarity I want.  I'm assuming the insides of this pedal are something like the ""bucket-brigade line"" delay pedals that started to come out in the early 80s. This pedal reproduces the feel of those - including the not-so-great fidelity. (Happily, I can't hear clock signals, nor aliasing, so we've come a little way forward in 30 years).  I'm guessing there are not many people pining for the sound of the old Electro-Harmonix delay lines - what you're likely coming to this pedal for is one of two things: 1. a cheap, crisp digital delay - and this pedal is NOT that on either count. 2. a tape echo (like an Echoplex), but in a more convenient solid-state form. This pedal tries a little bit to be that, but it doesn't have the fine control you need to work it as you would an Echoplex, and the knobs are tiny and down on the floor.

Have 4 e838s and have been looking to buy 2 more but can't since the e838/840 are now discontinued. - Then I came across the C195.  It was sold as a B-stock for $29, so I bought 2 figuring it was cheap enough to take a chance. - I just did a comparison between the e838 and C195.  Have them both connected to a Presonus Studiolive 16.0.2, set for the same gain & eq setting (which I usually use for the e838s during live events - I do live sound for events as a side job for fun).  Obviously the C195 requires 48V, which is not a problem with the Studiolive. - The C195 sounds much clearer, yet it also sounds fuller on the low frequency.  It was much louder than the e838, so I had to bring its fader down, as well as decrease the low EQ by 1 notch.  Here's what I had on the Studiolive in order to get the same volume level and almost the same sound on both mics (you can refer to the Presonus Studiolive 16.0.2's console picture to get an idea): - Sennheiser e838: fader at U, Mic/Line Gain at 2 o'clock (+3 notch from middle), Low Freq 155, Low Gain -4 - CAD C195: fader at U, Mic/Line Gain at 11 o'clock (-1 notch from middle), Low Freq 155, Low Gain -6 At the above settings, I still prefer the clear presence of the C195 over the e838 (and I have been happy with the e838 for over 6-month use & over 10 live events). - Also important: the e838 gave more handling noise than the C195 (I rubbed my hand on them while holding).  I could not really hear any handling noise from the C195.  It seems CAD really knows how make quiet mic, as I also have an E100S Equitek which is also dead quiet. I guess it's time to dump my e838s and upgrade to C195, even though the C195 is cheaper.

I am not going to regurgitate the specs that are on this page, but do want to point out that despite what the product description claims (at the time of this review), this system DOES NOT provide phantom power. If you are using condenser mics you will need a phantom power source or a mic pre amp that provides it.  For reference I play in a jazz duo and trio, and often with acoustic instruments. So take that into account when I say that this will work for venues of up to fifty people. As such this system is more than sufficient for solo and duo acts. You may be able to use it in larger venues for concerts as opposed to providing background and ambiance music. I have played in small venues where the audience was there for happy hour and chatting among themselves and this system would not work. I have also used it in much larger venues where the audience was there for a concert and this system easily provided the sound level needed to be heard.  One of the main reasons why I awarded this five stars is sound quality. Although the speakers are small they are rich sounding and can crank out some surprising low end when we run a piano through it. I also love the ability to tailor reverb to three of the channels independent of one another. In fact, you can turn reverb off on one or two channels while using it on a third, or any combination thereof. You can also set different reverb levels for each of the three channels that will accept reverb, which is a wonderful way to dial in various vocalists.

So after reading several reviews on these Cheapos, I came to the conclusion that I have a 50/50 chance of getting a decent sounding pair and its well worth a shot for the money.  Now, my preference has always been pickups from ""SeeMore Donut"" and DiMarzio, like their PAF Pros, but being that a person doesn't have to spend a fortune to get decent quality (proved that with the Cort X1 which is a Great Guitar), especially if the pickup really does have Alnico V magnets.  OK, so enough useless info, The Pickups arrived today, Very poorly packaged, both of them wrapped together with the pickup's faces Facing each other. When I saw this I pretty much assumed damage had been done, and sure enough. The surfaces of each pickup have rub marks from the other and one of them even has a tiny gouge on the edge (plastic), which I now realize was caused during assembly by careless handling of a soldering iron. The second has a good size gouge along the back edge, which was also obviously caused by a hot soldering iron melting the plastic.  Being that it is not so simple to just swap the pickups, meaning having to replace strings and do some cutting and soldering, I decided to not be so curious to the sound or waste my time installing them, but instead send them back for a refund, and possibly take a chance at buying another pair, with high hopes of receiving a blemish free set that sound better than what I have now. It could end up a so called ""Crap Shoot"" and I may have to order several pair until I finally get a good one of each, Not to mention sound quality is still unknown...

It is also made much more sturdily than the one he used before. Unlike that unit, this one has conspicuous solid welding on both support bars leading down to the ""feet."" It is very easy to adjust for standing or sitting while playing.  Our only wish is that it went down one more notch. For my husband to play with proper form, he needs it to be slightly lower or he has to sit on a pillow (which isn't a problem) to elevate that high. I'm ten inches shorter than my husband, but I can sit at the keyboard just fine at the lowest sitting, but I sit up quite rigidly which is probably a large part of it coupled with other measurements such as arm length, etc. However, I don't expect one stand to be able to accommodate everyone, so no star ducking for that.

Being a geek at heart I didn't follow that advise so my first cable was not a success. Fortunately the plugs are reusable and second try was 100% fine!  To save you a first time failure if you don't read the directions, the most important tips are: 1) make sure you cleanly cut the cable  end - easy with the included cutter, 2) when pushing the cable into the connector, push it firmly and twist it a bit at the same time.  This helps make sure there are no bits of the shield shorting the center contact and the vampire tap at the center of the plug makes good contact with the center conductor. Finally just tighten the screw to connect the shield, lock the cable into the connector and you are done with that end.  Very simple and reliable. But not as flexible as many guitar cables I use. Looking at the way solid shield contact is created (see pictures) and how the cable is locked into the connector a certain amount of cable resilience/stiffness is required. The resulting cable might seem stiffer than you might be used to. Remember: this is supposed to interconnect your pedals with short cables of just the right length, so being super flexible should matter less than if it were plugging one end into your your guitar and moving all over the stage.  The included tools - Flat Tip Screwdriver and Cable Cutter were better than I expected. Both worked just like they were supposed to. I was pleased the screwdriver was magnetized. That saved me from losing at least one connector locking screw!  The Planet Waves Solderless Custom Cable Kit does just what it is claims to do: Make building reliable exact length cables for connecting effects pedals and other components an easy process. It's not so good as a general guitar cable as the cable is a bit stiff for that. It comes with everything you need to make this possible and is a well thought-out product which has good instructions for those who eventually read them (like me!).

The bridge is not set right and it is too flat between the g and d strings and that makes it harder to not hit other strings. The bow is also nippy very good and neither is the shoulder rest. You can use this violin if you're a complete beginner; however, if you have $90 to spend on a violin I would suggest that you save up a little more money to get the Cecilio CVN 100 and upwards. Anything that the Mindini range has, Cecilio is better. If you have a low budget, then I would suggest getting a Cecilio CVN 100-300. I have had the Mindini 300 since August 20, 2016 and I did like it at first, but after about 3 months I got sick of the sound. It is very difficult to play on the right strings because the bridge is not as angled as I would like it and this can make it harder to learn how to play. The shoulder rest is also not of good quality. It is very small and it is not very comfortable. The strings are okay, but they do have a slightly sluggish movement on the left hand when you try to get the notes in really quickly; however, if you are playing that quickly anyway then you should just get a better violin. The Rosin is okay given the price of the violin, but I would suggest that you get a better quality rosin because it will make the sound better and you won't have to work so hard with the bow. Overall I am pleased with this violin at a beginner level.

1023,128249,5,True,"12 24, 2012",A2Y8JW5NSY95OL,B005FKF3P2,JdoubleH,"I must first state for the record, I hate strap locks. Hate may be a bit shy of the mark, actually. I've never met a set I liked in any single way.  I've only ever dropped an instrument that HAD strap locks on it. In fact, EVERY instrument I've owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune. Schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed- even with Locktite. When you install them, you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material (leather, nylon, etc), so it is never really tight. Plus there's only about two threads on the slim little nut, and if they aren't a really tight match to the other half, wear very quickly (especially since you have to tighten them so often). Duncan type often suffer from 'non-positive lock syndrome' if not regularly cleaned and lubed. Then there's the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons, your strap is only compatible with the ones which match. And then there is the the metal-on-metal clankyness. Yuck. Oh, and and the cost. Moving on.  Why are these little Elliptical End Pins so brilliant? They are NOT strap locks. If you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them - as you should, then in order to put your strap on and take it off, you will need to turn the strap 90 degrees to the instrument. This isn't something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage. Sometimes the simplest design is the best design. And they're pretty, too.  Downsides? I will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short, but then I would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly. If they don't, using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer- especially considering if the screws cut new threads, you're pretty much- uh, screwed. The washers these come with are pretty small too, so I just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons. With a brand new strap, they can be a bit tricky to get on, but just as tricky to get off (which is good). That tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap, especially if it is made from cheap materials. With older straps, just as with any traditional strap button, you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap, but it is very easy to verify, and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button. Mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly. But with strap locks, if there's a problem, you'll have to grab some tools to fix it - or replace it entirely. Talk about a false sense of security. With PE's Elliptical End Pins, you just put the strap where it should be and you're set.  If you are one who is taken to doing back-flips, or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hula-hoop onstage, then these probably won't save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkey's worst intentions. But if either of these antics are your norm, you might be better served by a permanently attached strap, or perhaps therapy.  Since writing the review above, I've ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses. I'm done with traditional strap buttons and don't imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks.","Excellent design, simple solution for those who hate strap locks",1356307200,22.0,{'Color:': ' Nickel'},,compatible supply inadvertently much prevent i've use find habit fix orient consider small button way like come positive order ever goblin order back-flips could shy come need nylon half properly traditional actually washer might permanently write one cost bass nut locktite simplest wear tight get antic point reach several tighten instrument screw screws intention button take cause problem non-positive something thread take duncan therapy state must oh norm well factory long less bad brand little put record really set lock gravity slip one fact drop frequently leather meet liked lubed mark tool replace new entirely turn beer back original make degree equip metal-on-metal argue misfortune answer attack horizontally cut sense precious increase material reason hold develop likely securely own good single false go serve lock type wide quickly use security probably fit first design bit cheap verify tightly intend hate ensure perhaps especially would metal imagine sometimes syndrome elliptical pe's etc also felt talk match material still shorter small compress even brilliant strap easy grab install downsides pin fasten check tend suffer tricky seat clean either plus never require short strap schaller i'm since best set move two often work compressible diligence instrument attach strap device end do there's slim regularly hula-hoop inertia cause suffer onstage use washer monkey's always say clankyness they're mechanical save every may older uh yuck unscrew unless pretty review

I bought this Mini as a way to have an easy way to practice guitar while sitting on a bed or couch, just like I do with the ukulele.  I still haven't traveled with it, but I wouldn't travel with my guitar, so this will be the way to do it.  The instrument is very nice, mostly well made and with good bright sound.  The sound board is solid spruce with an open grin satin finish and the nut & saddle are made of real bone.  It includes a nice gig bag, which is a bit short (tight) and not as good as Cordoba's regular gig bags. It comes tuned a fourth higher than a guitar, like a ukulele but it does sound like a guitar, a more subtle sound than a full body classical guitar, as expected. The intonation is very good in all strings up to fret 12.  A couple of things that would make it better (I hope Cordoba pays attention to these reviews):  some fret edges are a little sharp.  I file those with a small nail file but a better dressing would have been nice.  Also, I find the sound a little unbalanced with the bass strings overpowering the treble strings.  This might be a problem with the strings and not of the instrument itself.  When we have available different strings from other manufacturers we'll be able to experiment for a better sound.  There is available another set of strings tuned to E (light a regular guitar) but I haven't tested that.  Finally, some of  the tuning machines are smooth, others aren't, they look good quality though.  Overall, if you need a good, portable guitar, this is a good instrument.

1072,70803,3,False,"09 25, 2012",A2KI91IR3RA7D0,B000KIPUQG,David L. Vasser,"This device works.  Here's what it does.  You plug an electric bass into the pedal's instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal's high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp.  You also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jack out.  You can use just the high-impedance output or just the XLR output or you can use them both simultaneously.  When the ""footswitch"" is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box.  When the ""footswitch"" is on an LED light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on.  I put ""footswitch"" in quotes because I use fingers to push it, but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose.  When you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on, so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it.  Some other functional comments about it.  It runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply. I used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter.  Battery life isn't super but satisfactory.  Still if using it a lot, I suggest using an AC adapter.  When the battery starts going it sounds awful, but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set.  Also when the ""footswitch"" is off and the LED is not lit, this thing functions as a straight XLR ouput direct box for anything you plug into it.  You could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist!  The amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass, so just use it as a direct box with the tone/emulation circuit off for anything except bass.  The controls are all rotary knobs except the Ground-Lift switch which is a slide switch. The controls left to right, top row to second row are:  DRIVE, TREBLE, BASS, LEVEL, PRESENCE, GROUND LIFT SLIDE SWITCH and BLEND.  Taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed.  The DRIVE knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of overdriven tube tone.  Basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose.  There is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want.  The TREBLE knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of upper frequency tones.  The BASS knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies.  12 o'clock is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass knobs. The LEVEL knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration.  The PRESENCE knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone.  The Presence knob isn't a midrange control, but does boost the upper mids.  The GROUND LIFT switch only effects the XLR output jack and it should be left ""OFF"" unless you hook it up and there is hum.  Then you can turn the Ground Lift ""ON"" and it might help eliminate the hum issue.  However it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum.  The BLEND knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedal's output with all the way to the left being none, 12 o'clock being 50% and all the way clockwise being 100%.  CONS:  Very little bass gear, or anything else, is ""PERFECT"" these days.  Behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using Chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down.  Designed in Germany but built in China means you get Chinese components and Chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing.  For example at the first battery change the battery clip self-destructed as part of the clip's terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip.  This was a Duracell battery, the standard for pedal batteries.  Went to Radio Shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint.  I've never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard.  Construction is all plastic. The casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes I know not to use my size 13-D foot on it.  The Treble and Presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the XLR output for recording or a PA feed.  Basically I set the Treble and Presence to the point where I hear hiss start, then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit.  Hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off.  The jacks, other than the XLR, are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal, These type jacks are noted for causing problems, especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time.  This unit lacks any dedicated MIDRANGE knob but the Presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously.  Some people who use this pedal as a stage-tool use it as a solo or ""scoop"" switch for slap & tap solos so the presence, bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway.  PROS:  First and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features, but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely.  This isn't a Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver by any means, but works in a similar fashion to one.  I have a Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe that I use at gigs.  The Tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the Behringer cost.  I use the Behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home.  If I didn't have the Tech 21 unit I might take this unit to gigs, but it probably will last way longer the way I keep it setup at home all the time.  I especially like this unit when used with small rehearsal/practice type combos.  Many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious.  Part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you don't get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp.  It is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline, say anything over about 18 feet.  For recording the XLR direct out is very useful and the XLR direct out can also be used to feed the PA at a gig if your amp doesn't have a XLR direct out.  How I use this device:  I have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the XLR output to connect it to a microphone mixer.  The output from microphone mixer is patched into a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz soundcard in an XP computer. I can then record using the computer's recording software, practice solo or I can play along to recorded music using headphones.  With headphones I can play as loud as I want anytime that I want without disturbing anyone.  Most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass, so I recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers.  You can buy better computer speakers that are capable, but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp.  Quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capable.  Having owned this pedal for about 4 years and knowing what I know about it, I would buy it again.  I would strongly recommend it as a home recording/practice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong.  For home use it is fine.  You can use it at gigs but I'd be saving up ""gig bones"" to buy something more durable with better performance.",IT WORKS OK...BUT HAS DUBIOUS DURABILITY,1348531200,35.0,,,inject turtle power go stuck jack durability switch i've performance hiss entice backline passive strip bypass lean understand wide start supply edge fine actually time last problem software strongly insert get electrical many thing stomp sure unplug direct quote range stage labor really stage-tool hook part case turn control setup right solo attack cut point far pa home type nyc harmonic slap desktop tonal almost across boost zero adjusts would hear boost row blend terminal small work treble leave logically sound volume experience clip's combo design build presence construction run circuit set record capability combo instrument without powered comment device board preamp noise tone/emulation knob example frequency variable pleasing may hobbyist pedal small know computer's away hard plastic fix db duracell much radio connect amount drive hum none pad patch save like cabinet extra tap level ohm practice could take noticeable might product vintage useful cost open china finger clip headphone limit effect serious acoustic good size long place recording/practice remedy finish suggest one new crank electric emulation solder plug scoop own self-destructed germany signal day solder first feed lead help time component impedance top xp mixer issue buy general also decent still anyway patch midrange solo fashion year build old harmonic run tube slide tone use overdriven deluxe save recommendation personal low ac activate box second injects frequency record note tap foremost santa cost soundcard use gain break long coloration microphone o'clock beach light however recommend true amp need chinese mids battery unit tech important pro replacement glare upper anyone i'd volt wire change take run joint cable mean know bone output bass eliminate amp go eight less box leave music little soldered push lot distortion quality back feature rough wrong similar low foot durable good consider use anytime shack active safety mind get boost power ouput part tone standard gig pulled high-impedance start functional front pedal's make rehearsal/practice thickness xlr along beauty driver previous look typical life loop say strong transparently awful capable unless control simultaneously adapter look via cause master stay foot gear way lack speaker feature stompbox straight handy perfect completely generate active/passive wear footswitch high mode con something indefinitely mine clip gig line gentle put knob record tweeter tool behringer play conflict input here's issue lift clockwise computer rotary go sound circuit loud function probably disturb super price light want full jack switch especially inadequate ground dedicate cruz satisfactory easy else basically except guitar modification purpose spec standpoint never plug switch crank becomes instead eliminate battery content seem make flat people base ground-lift anything keep pretty

I took a chance on them anyway because I figured the fun effect they could have out weighed the chance that they were as bad as the reviews said they were. The fact is, these are pretty cool. I have played with them for about 1 hour total now and they work great and are holding up to quite a beating. Far more than I thought they would. They light up bright and look pretty awesome.  Having said that, there are a few things these are not. First as mentioned in other reviews they do not have the same feel as a wood stick. I see no reason to lower their rating for that though because after all, they are not wood sticks! Wood sticks are pretty rigid where these have some flex to them. They're not rubbery just not rigid like wood. This is likely so that they are durable. Unlike wood, plastic has no grain structure. If these were made more rigid they would likely be brittle and break easily. These are likely a compromise between rigidity and durability. Overall I'd say the effect is very livable and they are very playable.  Also, these will likely not be as durable as a good wooden stick. These again are not wood and plastic after all. The thing is, wood sticks don't last forever and even break during use. These also will not be every day sticks and possibly not even all night sticks. They will be sticks where the added effect of a brightly lighted stick is worth the loss of feel and possibly durability.  If you're thinking about these for an added effect for a show or a little novelty when your playing, I say go for it. They do appear to be able to hold up pretty well to hard use and for limited uses they can be pretty cool. Just don't expect that you will throw away your wood sticks, that's not the point of these.

1111,87856,5,True,"03 26, 2013",A1M7KEJJ2IRYIH,B0017H4EBG,Marc Concepcion,"To anyone who may be concerned that pricing determines actual *performance* quality in MIDI cables, let me assure you now that it doesn't. They either work, or they don't. Simple as that. (Also, ""wrong notes"" mean that they don't work. But that's most likely the controller glitching. There are ways to fix controller glitches which I do not feel I need to explain here.)  The only differences between lower and higher end cables is the amount of external abuse/interference they can withstand/prevent. In terms of latency, even USB 2.0's data transfer rate is beyond overkill for transferring MIDI data. Purchasing expensive MIDI cables is highly unnecessary unless you're considering ludicrous lengths such as 20 feet or longer (Edit: Or in such an environment in which you EXPECT them to sustain physical abuse. Of course, if you're doing that, an extra $70 probably isn't that big of a deal.) If you claim to feel ""Lag"" from a cable of this short product's short length, don't complain about it here. That's YOUR computer's fault, not the cable. On that note, you generally have three (2 hardware, 1 software) solutions for these latency issues/audio glitches: 1: Upgrade to a processor with more threads (Possibly expensive) 2: Get a better audio card and/or an external audio interface (Definitely expensive) 3: Reduce your sample buffer rate. (Note that this only fixes audio glitches. It CREATES a lag time between key input - response by allowing your computer more time to process the audio correctly.)  Edit: I didn't feel this was necessary to mention at first, but perhaps it will help anyone who is starting out with MIDI. If you haven't already, I recommend downloading the ASIO4ALL driver. This is more of a requirement than a suggestion. If you haven't done so, are working with whatever default driver is on your computer, and experience lag/inconsistent rhythm, this is most likely the fix for you.  The sample rate option's latency issue is resolved by option 1 (Processor upgrade). It should also be noted that the aforementioned audio ""glitch"" does not occur during the MIDI data transfer. It happens after it. Simply hearing any form of audio from your computer means the cable successfully sent it, regardless of quality.  To sum it up--once again--MIDI cables either work or don't. There is no real difference in ""performance"". You're transferring concrete digital data. This isn't actual audio. If you intend to spend more money on wiring, they should go towards good quality audio cables, not MIDI.  Are these cables worth buying? You get what you pay for. These cables don't have fancy plating/shielding for more accurate data transfer. They don't claim to reduce external electrical/radio interference. They're not a major name brand. Also, if you've been paying attention, none of that actually matters. Catch my drift?  Please excuse the long explanation, but I felt it was necessary based on some of the reviews I saw when first looking at this product.

Now that I have it, I'm beginning to wonder whether most of these melodicas are made in the same factories and are simply branded differently. This one is nearly identical to the Hohner Instructor 32. The plastic molding is clearly the same, literally identical. The main differences between the Hohner and this one are the finishing touches, the mouthpieces, and the cases. The Hurricane Harps S32 doesn't have quite the high-gloss sheen of the Hohner, you can still see faint swirl marks from where the Hurricane Harps melodica was buffed after casting whereas the Hohner is completely polished and shiny. The handles on both melodicas are identical in pattern and material but the Hurricane Harps' handle is white and the Hohner's is black. The mouthpieces that came with the Hurricane are a straight one and a tube with a straight end, while the Hohner has more of a goose neck mouthpiece and the tube has a 90 degree elbow at the bottom to reduce the amount of bending required when playing on a tabletop. The Hohner's case/bag is made of nicer fabric but the Hurricane Harps case has metal buckles and clips (plastic on the Hohner). Both melodicas sound pretty much the same, though the Hohner has slightly better reed response on the highest couple of notes.

I am able to load this thing up with a Gibson Les Paul Standard, a Bishline Walnut Banjo, 2 acoustics, a Music Man Sting Ray, and a Music Man Sterling bass.  The first things I thought of when this stand caught my attention were will it hold the instruments securely, will it hold the weight of my instruments, how much area does it cover and will it fall over.  I have just shy of $10K worth of instruments hanging on this thing so it's important that I can trust this stand to hold the instruments securely.  It definitely holds the instruments securely.  It uses a system by which the weight of the instrument engages the grabbing auto-grip and lifting the instrument up disengages the auto-grip.  It's really pretty ingenious in its simplicity.  Also, this tree has no problem holding the weight of my instruments.  Even with an uneven weight distribution, the stability of the stand is unquestionable.  I have a Bishline walnut banjo (heavy!) and a Gibson Les Paul (heavy) along with an acoutic (light) on the second level and it holds them no problem.  On the bottom level, I have a StingRay bass (heavy!), a Sterling bass (medium) and another acoustic (light).  I'm not sure of the total weight but I would guess somewhere close to 60lbs. worth of instruments.  The stand will take up approximately 4.5 square feet of floor space.  It's approximately 3 feet from the tip of one foot to the next foot(3ftx3ft from leg to leg/2 for the triangle configuration of the feet=4.5sq ft).  I've pushed on the trunk (side to side and down) with a single guitar on it and with it loaded up to see if there is any chance it will fall and short of someone literally running into the stand, it won't be knocked over.  The way I have the stand set, the top is right around the 6-foot mark.  This is customizable.  The thing that's also great about this stand is the vertical configuration.  It can save you some space over the conventional rectangular floor multi-stand.  Another plus is the heights of the grips and supports are totally customizable, so if you're using basses, guitars, and banjos it will accommodate them all.  The two levels of grips and rests can be adjusted independently.  Plus if you know music stands, the Hercules brand is about as good as they get.

1176,802,4,True,"05 16, 2012",AQ3BVPWA301ZF,B000068NZG,J. Foster,"Let me start this by saying that the bad reviews need to be read from a very skeptical viewpoint.  It sounds like most of the bad reviews were written by people who had purchased this for a mic that needs a different type of cable, or who don't understand the wiring of this cable and it's intended function.  With only one exception, this cable is NOT designed for a stereo camera.  That exception being a stereo microphone that uses a male 3-pin XLR jack to output an unbalanced, stereo feed across pins 2 and 3 (with pin 1 being ground).  Excepting that very rare microphone type, this should not be used for a stereo camera.  This cable is a BALANCED cable.  It is designed for Balanced XLR microphones (pretty much any professional microphone) to connect to a camera or device that uses a BALANCED 1/8"" TRS microphone input jack.  It is wired Pin 1 to Sleeve, Pin 2 to tip, and Pin 3 to Ring.  Again, it should not be used for anything with a stereo input on a 1/8"" TRS jack.  For those people wanting to use a professional XLR microphone with a stereo camcorder, you need to search for a mono XLR to Stereo 1/8"" TRS cable.  I have one, that I purchased from Amazon and it works very well for my stereo cameras.  This is not that cable.  Now, that said, Here's my review... It does what it is supposed to do.  I don't really know what else to say.  I purchased this to use with my T2i running Magic lantern that allows the use of balanced mics on the external input.  When I run my T2i with the mic jack as a stereo input, I have to use my other adapter or my stereo microphone with it's own cable.  The wiring seems fine, though a little on the fragile side.  With normal home/amateur use, this will work fine.  For professional use, you probably won't be using any cameras with an 1/8"" jack anyway.  If it used a bit heavier cable and a Neutrik connector, I would give it 5 stars, but then it would cost a lot more.  For what it is, it's actually just fine.  I guess my only real complaint is that it looks identical to my XLR to stereo 1/8"" TRS cable, so I had to use a sharpie to mark this one as being balanced and mark my other one as being stereo.  Not a big deal, but something to keep in mind if you get multiple Hosa adapters.  Edit to add:  here is the link to the stereo cable that most people should get...

They are one of two suppliers that sell these mics in multi-packs. You can buy the mics individually or in packs of two, three or five. If you buy five at once, it works out to $1.75 per mic.  Yes, the ATR sounds better and looks better. But it's over ten times the price! For voice recording, computer applications, and so on, these mics are great. Cheap but good sound.  The Neewer mics have a stereo plug on them that not only drive both the left and right channels in a stereo recorder without an adapter (as a mono source, of course), but also adhere to the plug-in power specification for microphones.

Original Review:  I bought one of these from ProMusic to see how it compared to the really cheap ones I've been using and, while it looks exactly the same it is a lot brighter.  Instead of using three batteries in parallel, it has them somehow in series (the batteries insert different directions).  This makes the ProMusic version much brighter when using batteries, although battery life may suffer.  Another improvement is that the USB chord is a proper 6 foot length on the ProMusic version, so the charger and chord don't have to hang in the air.  Hopefully this will result in longer life for the chord.  Unfortunately, the ProMusic version is much dimmer on 110 VAC power than on batteries.  It is still bright enough for everyday use in my practice room, but I wouldn't want to depend on it for gigs.

The wound strings are wound well and they're all attached to a brass ball end with a decent twist and loop. Like the leading string brands, these are made in the USA, so they're good strings and not the sub par made in Korea stuff I've gotten in store giveaways.  Tone-wise...they're new, good strings. Maybe other players can pick out nuances from one new string to another, but as long as it's in tune, it just sounds like a new string to me. Almost all strings sound and play nice when you first put them on. I tend to look at how long they maintain their tone, tuning, and playability. Especially when you leave them on way longer than you should like me. I suspect they'd last as long as any other good set, but time will tell.  I've mainly used GHS Boomers for twenty or so of the thirty something years I've been playing. I had read about using equal tension on each string, and it seems like sound logic, pun intended, and I was given a chance to review this set. The GHS 9-42 set I use has 9-11-16-24-32-42 gauge strings. This Stringjoy 9-42 set only differs with two, the B and G strings, to get 9-12-15-24-32-42. So the B is bigger and the G is smaller. Perhaps I was expecting something dramatic, but I didn't feel a huge difference, perhaps because the set gauges are pretty similar to begin with...? Maybe bends were easier, or maybe it's just new strings, or maybe just in my head. So I can't really say if they ""work"" and are that much more balanced than what I'm already used to. Others may notice a bigger difference. However, from what I can see, hear, and feel while using them, they are quality strings that stay in tune well.  I like that they donate 5% of the profits to music education programs (noted on the back of package), and while they do seem to be decent strings so far, I personally didn't notice a huge enough difference to justify the cost when I can get a set of GHS Boomers for about four bucks. I'd give them 3 1/2 stars, because I like the quality of strings, but for me they're not worth the cost. Meh, 4 stars is close enough.

It is so good at what it does it is just crazy.  My one problem with this is that it is not delicate enough to use on certain finishes.  If you have a satin finish or even semi gloss (really anything less than a mirror like gloss), this will totally change it, the manufacturer even advises against using it on anything except gloss finish.  That being said, it won't take all the little swirl marks out (maybe just a few shallow ones), but it will make your guitar shine like crazy without leaving behind any residue and make the finish look a lot cleaner than it ever has.

During that time I have owned, Guild D40 acoustic, Fender Strat, Ibenez hollow body electric jazz guitar, Guild Bluesbird Electric, Washburn Classical and a Gibson ES335. I am not here to tell you this guitar is equal to or better than those but I am going to say that for the price this is an excellent guitar. Fit, finish, sound and playability is really impressive at this price point.  In a way I am sad to be so happy with this guitar, labor cost is so low in China that they flood our market with products that are, at least on the surface, very high quality. This global free market has helped to enrich the lives of people in China and Mexico while at the same time eliminated jobs for Americans. Fender makes guitars in Mexico and profits from the cheap labor, Gibson makes it's Epiphone guitars in Asia and also profits from the cheap labor. So my pleasure with this instrument is tempered by that fact.  But back to the guitar. I am shocked that it made it to my home in New Jersey in one piece. The guitar box was in an Amazon box twice it's size and with nothing but a small amount of brown paper that did little to cushion it. The box from China had little real packing but in spite of that it arrived in excellent condition.  When the guitar arrived I allowed it to come up to room temperature before I even touched it, this guitar is a world traveler, from China, to Texas, to Kentucky and finally New Jersey where the temperature was around 19 when UPS dropped it off.  Once the guitar had warmed up I inspected it, it is a lovely piece, wood is beautiful and blemish free. There is a scarf joint in the neck, not at all unusual in import guitars. Some hate it, some say it's better that way, I have no informed opinion and it is barely noticeable without close inspection.  I tuned the guitar and noted that the action was high at upper registers. I used the included allen wrench  to tighten down on the truss rod. The first three 1/4 turns had little resistance which indicated to me the bar was under no stress, after a couple more turns the resistance was there and the neck came into adjustment quickly. After a few days I will probably need to do it again when the guitar settles into the temperature and humidity of my house.  Once the neck was adjusted I again tuned it and it is a pleasure to play, great action, no buzzing and the intonation at the 12th fret was spot on.  The built in tuner is accurate when checked against my other tuner and the electronics all seem fine, no feed back.  The guitar is roughly the size of a Gibson Les Paul and is quite heavy. The 1 7/8"" nut is the same as my Washburn Classical but the neck is thinner similar to an electric guitar.

The Voodoo Labs model gets rave reviews but I couldn't justify the cost for my needs. This power bar had everything I need: (7) 9V-100mA outlets, (1) 9V-500mA, (1) 12V-100mA, (1) 18V-100mA. It even works fine to power my new TC Nova Delay on the 9V high current outlet, despite the TC requesting 12V. It is a solid power strip and comes with all the cables.  One less than desirable aspect is the wall-wart style adapter  the Voodoo model is better in this respect. I don't like having the thin wire from the power strip to the wall outlet. My plan, however, is to use a regular extension cord permanently mounted to bring power to my pedal board, and have the adapter plugged into it under the pedal board with the small cable zip tied out of the way.

Dunlop having the original and dual design locks.  I have both types on my guitars.  First the Dunlop: (all finish types) Installation was simple, screw was replaced with the one included in the package. I had to drill one of my guitars to enlarge the hole, easy. The finish of the lock was O.K. the black suffered the most with some dings and scratches, depending on the shipping and how long the locks were packed the finishing flaws will vary. I noticed it the most on black.  They feel secure and lock well in place; I still feel they are a bit far from the guitar body as compared to the Schallers. I would recommend the dual design as opposed to the original.  One big negative is the strap installment; your life could turn into hell depending on the strap ends thickness. And the lock is just not designed to be removed form the strap easily. If you wish to change, wash or replace the strap in the future it is very hard and you could damage the locking mechanism (a metal ring, open locking C washer).  Second the Schaller: (chrome/nickel) Installation was simple also, straight on. Finish is great; however, metal washer for the strap ends could get damaged depending on what type of tool you use to install the locks on the strap. Use a flat small wrench available in hard ware stores (was not included in the package) I bought them from a local store.  They fell very secure and are snug to your guitar body resulting in less strain on the lock ends.  Installing the locks on the strap is a breeze, just tightening the nut with a washer over the strap and you're done. Changing the strap, no problems, easily loosen the nut and replace.  The only negative is that you could mar the teeth of you over tighten.  Both are great, however I recommend the Schaller.

I have learned a few songs, but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar.  I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap.  I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago.  The Fender and the Dean's were very nice.  I thought the Dean's had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender.  This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well.  I couldn't figure out the different tunings on it though.  It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle.  I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal.  The other one's must be for some special type of music.  But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Dean's.  It is also very easy to hold unlike the Dean's I have found.  The Dean's also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus.

I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one -- some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable, but this one was usually reviewed well. It was the perfect choice. This strap needs no wearing-in -- it's supple and soft right out of the box. The leather on top is smooth and classy looking, and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft, with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder. The wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better, and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps. All of this adds up to a great deal of comfort.  I use Dunlop strap locks on my instruments, and with a thicker strap like this, I had some concerns about getting them on there, but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap, no problem.

Now here comes the bad news . The zoom h5 says it's a 4 track recorder but actually it's inly a 3 track. You cannot separate the left and right channels so it only records as one track. If you want 4 tracks you have to purchase another capsule for $70 that has 4 XLR inputs. I was willing to accept that but when I finally realized that once you bounce/mix your tracks down you can't overdub onto the mixed down file. Seeing as how you only get 3 tracks to work with this is quite limiting. What's the point of having a multitrack recorder if you can bounce down tracks and then overdub onto them? It makes no sense. Once I finally discovered this I went and exchanged it for a tascam 8 track ports studio. I would also like to add this thing is far from intuitive like the H4. It took me 3 weeks to finally find that out because I was trying to figure the thing out.

Pros (for me) - Good sound - Good headroom - Low distortion - Low noise - DI is good for bass and electric guitar - Balanced in/out - Useful VU meter - Useful send/return - Headphone monitoring - Notched Gain + Linear trim  Cons (for me) - Big and ugly - The space is spent on all-in-one kind of stuff. If you just want the preamp, get the 2 channel 1U rack. - I wish they made this unit in a full 1U rack unit with all the same inputs/outputs - No TRS output. XLR output only  I use it for vocals, acoustic guitar, and electric bass. It handles everything very well. No complaints on pre-amp performance.  This design may be useful to put in a sound booth if the performer wants to monitor themselves and the cue mix from the engineer. In a big studio they're likely to have all that hardware in the monitoring room, but for smaller studios and home studios, this could be a useful tool. For the monitoring room it's a big box that gets in the way. I'd much rather have a 1 or 2 channel full 1U rack version of this, but I do appreciate it as a standalone box for practicing DI instruments or testing mics.  This is a step up from my other cheaper preamps. If you are on the SM7 bandwagon, then yes, it is powerful and clean enough for that mic. But don't think that ""clean"" means there is no amp his at all. At 50db Gain I measure an average (across the freq spectrum) noise level of -100dB RMS in my DAW. This is quite good.  Make sure you use balanced inputs. You'll need a female XLR to male TRS to put the output of the preamp into the line input of your A/D converter. You can go straight XLR to your mic input, but you may get different sounds and distortion levels.

1525,3075,5,True,"09 30, 2014",A38SK72V6NORUP,B0001ARCFA,ReaderHal,"I bought my first pair of these AKGs sometime from 1975 to 1978, and loved them.  Used them for about 15 years until they were damaged in a mishap.  I've had other 'phones since then, most notably the Nakamichi SP-7, but none I liked as much as that old pair from the past.  So when I saw that they were either still - or once again - available (and on sale) I had to get a pair especially since I'm using headphones a lot lately.  I just had to know whether they were as good as I recalled.  They are better.  Improved, I guess.  They still look, feel and fit the same - and that's a good thing.  The bass is deep and well-defined, not artificially boosted but can thump with the best when a thump is on the recording(Gov't Mule's ""Lay Your Burden Down"").  Highs are clean and well-extended - certainly they go higher than my 10khz cutoff hearing - younger folks who've passed through like the highs.  Mids sound good, with virtually none of the congestion you can get with lesser 'phones or speakers.  As the mids become more complex due to multiple instruments, its easy to follow just one (for instance cello in several quartets I sampled).  Dynamics are great, as heard in Glenn Miller Orchestra, ""In the Digital Mood,""  ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" track, and the Tchaikovsky ""1812 Overture"" in this case on Telarc.  With movies, explosions can be startling.  In addition to sound quality, these headphones are also superlative in other ways.  One is the way they fit.  Yes, they are pretty large, but the large cups fit around the ear and press against the skull, which reduces ear soreness to virtually none.  The gimbal construction, which auto adjusts when simply put on the head has always been a strong point of this headphone.  I can wear them for hours with no ear soreness.  Also, fit and finish is excellent - AKG have obviously kept QC standards up despite having these made now in China.  Connections are first-rate, and the cable enters at the Left earcup as the good Lord intended.  I love the compactness and fit of the screw-on 1/4"" plug (an adaptor that fits over the 1/8"" - 3.5mm - plug).  The one area in which the headphone does not excel is isolation, but that is to be expected with an open (they call it semi-open) type cup construction.  On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to attain this level of sonic excellence in a closed-back design.  I've heard none, if they exist, but even if there is one I'm sure it would be much more pricey.  Generally, one just expects to give up the ""airy"" sound of an open design with a closed headphone, so it depends on the importance of isolation to the listener.  I have a pair of closed-backs to use when needed, but most of the time I'll be using these.  I'm not saying these are perfect, but they are as close as I'll get, since I certainly won't spend more than a c-note on headphones - it just wouldn't be prudent.  I pushed my own limits to get these at just less than seventy bucks, and I'm darned glad that I did.

If you want the one to make sounds WITH, you buy the yellow ""Kaossilator"". That's the short of it.  I have both and both are good for different reasons.   The yellow Kaossilator is for making phrases. In otherwords in an electronic synthesizer and phrase machine. It also has a beat maker in it and you can modify, record and layer the sounds any way you'd like. The yellow Kaossilator is pretty much a ""One-Man-Band"" device! Very powerful and I would not consider it just a toy IMO. People can write entire music albums with that one device.   Now for the Mini KP Kaos Pad. I Bought this through Amazon for $109 SHIPPED at the time so shop around and you could get lucky. It came the business day after Christmas and I had ordered it a day or two before so the free shipping was amazingly fast and awesome!  The Mini KP is for modifying existing sounds. Yes, it does have a few synthesizer like sounds in it (I believe about 10 or twenty) but the other 80 channels are for running sound ""through"" to modify those sounds when you press the pad. It won't play any sounds you run through it on the RCA input to output unless you press the pad and let the sounds through. When you move your finger around on the pad the sounds are modified according to that effect parameter, as shown in the manual. (pitch, frequency etc etc etc the list goes on and on)  So you can't really use the MiniKP as a stand alone one man band device like the Kaossilator. It is more along the lines to modify sounds than create them, although it does have a very very small slice of some built in sound effects that are pretty cool on their own like one I relate to sounding like "" evil harsh wind"" that you control the depth and pitch of. Much unlike the Synth like qualities of the Kaossilator.  As you can see they go hand in hand nicely. I'd even recommend hooking the MiniKP up to a Bliptironic 5000 and using the kaossilator separately and you have some crazy meditative grooves to be made! See my other reviews for the Bliptronic 5000.  I hook all these little instruments up to my 5 channel dj effects mixer and get jiggy with it.

1568,63750,5,True,"06 30, 2011",A396ELNTQDFYPO,B000CZ0RII,Mark King,"Like many others I dismissed the Behringer patchbay because it was tooooo cheap, how could it possibly be anygood?  A BIT OF HISTORY: Back in the 90's I bought some of the Neutrik TRS patchbays, back then they worked pretty well but over the years the newer versions of the Neutriks have different jacks in them that are difficult to plug in and the normal connections have gotten flakey. Besides the jacks getting cheaper and cheaper in the Neutrik units the metal work has changed from year to year, now the face plate is held on with two little screws that barely engage the metal and if you lose one the whole thing becomes a flimsy mess.  So I looked for a replacement and almost passed on the Behringer units again because of the low low price. I'm an electrical design engineer by trade and build a lot of my own gadgets. There are 96 1/4"" TRS jacks on one of these patchbays, $50/96= just $.52-cents per jack (not including metal work, packaging or labor), how could they possibly be any good?  Then I found a review online from someone who had been using the Behringer units for years without problems. He stated that the key to using them was to support the cables so they don't put a strain on the jacks. Recently we were putting a broadcast studio together and needed some patch capability so we decided to try one of the Behringer units. It was sort of a joke at first, everyone expected these units to be crap. Instead, we found a product that works fantastic, is super easy to configure (due to the 3-pos switches) and the jacks are like buttered toast, no more fighting to get the cable in or out. TRS plugs glide in and out smoothly, easily and most important of all, reliably!  I measured the impedance from input to output of one channel (passing thru the normal connection path) using a Fluke DVM and found less than one-ohm of series resistance, this speaks pretty well for the normalled connection not degrading your audio sonically. On some old ""mil spec"" patchbays I've measured as much as 10 ohms thru the normal path, that's what happens when the contacts get dirty. On one of our Neutirks that was going flakey I measured 39 ohms in series, that's enough to seriously upset the CMRR of a balanced line which can be a big source of noise.  We now have four of the PX3000 installed and no issues with a single connection. I've used them in all three modes (normalled, unnormalled and half normalled) and they are in use every day. We don't do a ton of patching on them (the normal connections run our studio) but when we need to insert something or do a quick reroute these tools get the job done reliably.  Each channel of the PX3000 is built on its own little circuit board (I had to look inside) which slides into the metal frame. You never have to access these little boards to configure the patchbay (like on Neutrik, DBX, and others) but the little boards do have a very tiny amount of give in the chassis, this is what makes it feel a bit ""unsolid"" to some folks.

My PX-350M fits into the case like a hand in a custom-made glove. I found the materials and findings (zippers, ring attachments, fasteners, strap), as well as the construction of the case itself to be of the highest quality. There is a modest amount of padding which will protect the keyboard and its controls from minor jostling/bumping/scraping during storage or transport, but nothing which offers protection from being dropped, manhandled, or major accidents or carelessness. (Think ""guitar in a softsided gig bag."")  The bag can be easily folded into a tidy square parcel when not in use. It actually comes shipped that way. The simplest method to put the keyboard in the bag is just to put the open bag on a solid surface--floor, counter, furniture, etc.,--and place the keyboard inside. You can then adjust the sides around the case and zip the bag closed. Not rocket science, and not difficult.  There are two zippered pockets in the ""lid"" of the case, each almost as wide as, and fully a third of the length of the bag itself. They are plenty large enough for a pedal, the keyboard cords, a goodly amount of music, etc. Very useful and well thought out. Don't expect them to hold tons of stuff. They are flat, non-gusseted pockets, there for convenience, not to be jammed full to bursting.  Storing the music stand for the keyboard can be a little problematic. I do not travel with my keyboard, but do store it from time to time when I need the additional space in the spare bedroom for actual house guests. I usually store the music stand separately on a closet shelf, but I think there's enough room in the case to put a layer of bubble wrap, a towel, or something similar, across the keys and controls and slide the stand in without fear of damaging it or the keyboard.  I purchased a Gator dustcover for my keyboard and store the Casio, covered, in the case. It's just another layer of protection for my piano. Great dust cover by the way. I reviewed it, if you're interested.  Price-wise I'm happy with the value from Amazon.

Well built with no structural flaws (though there is some cosmetic imperfections on the wood). The most important part is that this guitar is playable, and the free lessons will be a great help for her learning. Hopefully this is the start of a long love for this beautiful instrument, and will open up yet another door for a larger (and more expensive) option down the road.  Update (02/02/17): I'm dropping my original rating down by one star. Like other people have reported, it does not stay in tune very long. Particularly the bottom three strings: G, B & E. I'm hoping that in time the strings will stretch and hold the notes for longer, but so far not so much.

This IS my only distortion pedal now and I am very very happy with the tone.  However, There is one ""flaw"" in the design that is a big usability issue, which all pedals that share this flat-box mechanical design share: Using the foot-switch causes the controls to change because the switch is close to the controls and there is no height difference between the controls and the switch. You just CANNOT be delicate enough when you are turning the pedal on and off while playing in a live situation. The Riot has an FxLink jack so that you can switch it from a remote switch. But who has room for that? The FxLink jack allows them to justify the Riot to be in this price range. However, I would much rather spend another $50 on this pedal to have it usable as a single unit (be mechanically designed like a Boss pedal), than spend $20 on a remote switch and try to find a place to put it.  I have never been a fan of distortion pedals. Still not, but this is totally usable. This does NOT sound like a buzz-saw or a can-of-bees. It has a fairly warm tube distortion type of sound: it's tone is much more pleasing than the worst tube distortion but not as good as the best tube distortion. At the control settings I use it has a tight low-end and just the right amount of crunch without being crunchy like a bag of chips. Seems to have about the right selection of harmonics (that which is distortion). However you can adjust the controls to get a lot of crunch and a little softer of a low-end. It has a fairly wide range of EQ tone adjustment AND distortion range, but always retains the unique signature distortion tone that is specific to the Riot pedal.  It has a good range of responsiveness that I love from tube-amps: play soft or turn guitar volume control down for light to no distortion and play hard or turn guitar volume up for full distortion. That said, it does not have that soft compression distortion: still sounds like the guitar signal hits a wall when the distortion starts. It has an OK range from clean to moderately distorted, but there really isn't a distortion range from moderately distorted to really distorted (it's just more of the same).  I am using this into a Mesaboogie Express 5:25.  In my opinion, this amp has the worst tube distortion I've ever heard -- very mushy lows and just the wrong series of harmonics for most any style. It sounds okay for bluesy playing, but that's about it. It has a great clean sound and lots of other features I like -- the Riot pedal totally makes up my dirty sound.  For those looking for true-bypass, I believe this qualifies in a round-a-bout way. I appears to uses a relay or something similar. Pull the power and it stays in the mode it was in: on or off (on without power means no sound passes through the pedal). The bonus is that it can be switched from a remote source through it's FxLink jack. It can also be set to power up in the on or off state.

I did a test interview with my equipment and everything worked as expected. The cables seem to be of solid construction, so they should last for some time.

It has worked well with no surprises so that much is a no brainer. The click is really good on this one unlike DOD pedals that have the typical wimpy pad. No need for directions because it's failrly self-explanitory. As a side note: It's got that shamrock green color that matches five other pedals I have. Not why I bought it but it's just a little wierd thing I guess. How does it sound ? Well not too bad but the range of effect contouring is limited. It is easy to find a good useable tone but overall the tones don't necessarily inspire. The ""type"" knob is by far the best thing on this pedal and really helps to differentuate between ""tonal options"", without it it's just another pedal. If you can find a decent swell(ing) effect then it becomes more useful. As an octavier type effect, just get an octave pedal instead. I really don't see myself useing the envelope setting.....it's just a little thin and lifeless. As others have mentioned, it's not a WAH by any means and the word SYNTH is also questionable but I knew that ahead of time so it's no surprise. I also noticed it doesn't play well with other pedals and tends to clip when it's at odds with a wave setting. I have a strong original tone to start from so this pedal doesn't take away from that so it's not a tone sucker. Used in the effect's loop it shines better. Do I see myself useing it often enough to justify the purchase ? Well, I can find a few ways to use it but that's more of a personal thing more than a gripe.

Both -20 decibel attenuation switches are absolutely in the off position.  The volume level is lowered by a lot with this thing. Too much, in my opinion.  If I go straight into my powered speaker from the music source without this box connected, the sound level is much louder.  Yes, I detect less noise, if you will, when the box is utilized...but perhaps that is just because the box naturally drops the volume level as the signal is passing through it.  And again, the two attenuation switches are off. This box has the capability to attenuate the signal either -20 or -40 decibels by either pressing in one or two of the attenuation switches.  I doubt the box is defective. I think it was just designed to lower the decibel level automatically by default. Now, I guess if you have a powered speaker with enough headroom to make up for the volume drop, and if you do not mind running your speaker's volume knob much higher than normal, this natural volume drop via the box might not be an issue for you.  For example: Without the box I get great loudness from my powered speaker with its volume knob at its eleven o'clock position. With the box connected I have to turn the speaker's volume dial closer to the 3 o'clock position to get the same volume level. (Its maximum position is 5 o'clock, just for reference). This is way-too-big of a decrease of the sound level with this box connected.  I also find the clarity of the sound a bit muddied when going through this box. And it is to a point where as a DJ this would be unacceptable...and that means I cannot use this box.

1645,101385,5,False,"02 9, 2010",A3LASROOYK1VM4,B001GD07SK,WebbMan,"The following is my REVIEW of: Blackheart BH-5 Little Giant Tube amp head, the BH-112 Bottom, BEHRINGER Digital Reverb pedal, and BOSS BD-2 Blues Driver.  The Blackheart LITTLE GIANT Half Stack consisting of the BH-5 head matched with the BH-112 bottom has earned rave reviews from many respected sources for its great tube sound for little monney, an excellent value at approx. $350 (Musicians Friend). I personally found everything positive said about this great little halfstack to be 100% TRUE. It seems to be sturdy and well made but lack handles. It has a handy 3 watt/5 watt selector switch which lets you go from practicing in a little apartment, to actually practicing with your garage band. In both the 3 and 5 watt selections you get a thick, rich tube sound but for some reason the 3 watt sound just a bit muddy compared to the 5 watt. To dial-in the sound you want it has tone adjustment with its treble, mids & bass knobs BUT on the down side there is NO gain & reverb controls. THIS IS WHERE THE F/X PEDALS COME IN.  So I said to myself this is the PERFECT opportunity to daisy-chain a couple pedals and see what happens. I selected the BOSS BD-2 for tone & gain, and daisy chained that with the Behringer Digital Reverb for the reverb sound.  About BOSS, my experience has shown me you can't go wrong with the BOSS brand. They come through with the goods every time but at $90+ dollars per pedal I feel they are on the pricey side and I try to save if I can. As suspected, the Tone & Gain came though like a champ. Even at low volume levels the BH-5 set at 3 watt and half volume achieved that much desired ""Speaker Breakup"" sound. Don't get me wrong, YES you can get the speaker breakup sound from the amp on its own But without a gain control to boost the signal and push the tubes, you really have to crank up the volume. Neighbors may not appreciate that much :)  About BEHRINGER (the poor man's pedal), my experience has shown me at $27+ per pedal the value is excellent but the natural tone is lacking. For example I tried to save a few dollars by buying the Behringer Blues Overdrive pedal (instead of the Boss BD-2) and all I can say is NO-WAY. To me the sound was very artificial and didn't meet my expectations. My wife saw how frustrated I was with the Behringer Blues Overdrive and she surprised me with the BOSS BD-2 for Christmas... Thanks Honey :)  BUT WAIT - Don't give up on Behringer yet!!  Again with the lure of saving a few bucks I decided to try the Behringer DIGITAL REVERB and was very pleasantly surprised. I was hoping for a realistic Reverb sound and this time Behringer truly delivered. There's many different settings such as Spring, Plate, Hall, and Gate. They all sound accurate like the real thing and it's the first Behringer pedal I'm really glad I own. It gets the job done.  IN CONCLUSION - If you're looking for a great all tube little half stack at a great value. The Blackheart Little Giant halfstack is an excellent choice. AND if you want amazing sound that rivals tube amps costing TWICE the price, simply add and overdrive & reverb pedal. I personally got the tone I was looking for from the BOSS BD-2 chained with the Behringer Digital Reverb. Experiment and see what works for you. Hope this helps, and as always, THANKS for reading my reviews. Be well.

This stamp is applied by Epiphone to guitars that were damaged during shipping (sometimes broken bodies, more commonly broken headstocks and necks) then returned to Epiphone so they may repair the damage if possible,  and release it for sale as a ""severely damaged but factory repaired"" instrument.  You should be able to get these guitars for 60-70% of the regular retail price (in this case, a $499 guitar should only sell for about $350-375).

It was doing weird things like not working in my FX Loop and had a weak unusual sound. The other problem I was having with it at this same time was that it worked with a power supply but not with a battery. So, after plugging it straight into the front of my Randall RD5H and using a battery in it leaving the pedal off, it would allow my signal to go through and amp worked as normal. When I turned the pedal on, my signal would not go through. No sound. I took it apart and noticed nothing abnormal, I'm not handy in this area, I was just curious. After putting back together and trying again, it sort of works. No batteries but with a power supply it seems to be working like it did before. Only it seems that o have to turn the mix and repeat up a little further than before. It also gives me a nice little boost on the highs with it engaged. Sometimes I turn it on and everything on 0 just for the clarity it gives my tone. It definitely works best in the loop of all of my amps. I do plan on purchasing a new one at some point but not this one. Probably spend a little more on something more known for reliability as well as sounding great. Overall, the build quality is good with this pedal. I can't say much for the internals, as Idk what is good and what's not. It looks pretty neat and well constructed on its board though. The input jacks are good and sturdy, I've used smoother though. The knobs turn smoothly as you would expect any other pedal to work. The biggest knock on this pedal and all of joyo's pedals are the battery trays, they aren't great. Just flimsy plastic. The stomp button is pretty loud! Overall, this is a solid pedal at a fantastic price. The battery tray is one of the only noticeable things of less quality than a pedal 3 or 4x the cost of this one. That's not a problem if you hook up to a power block, like I do and recommend by the way. The sound is good and clear both on clean and even with an overdriven, heavily saturated amp. I have another joyo pedal (ultimate drive) and it has held up great and no issues since the day I got it. I actually bought them both on the same day.

1739,171605,4,True,"08 27, 2015",A1UB6Z3RO4TQYW,B00KZHMTZ2,Tom Meninga,"I really like these Blues DeVille harmonicas. Most of the time, they sell for under $30. They sound fantastic.. loud gritty tone. They are airtight. I had no problems playing any of the notes, including the #2 and #3 draw notes, which are tough to play on some harps.  These are heavier than some harmonicas, which some folks might mind, but I like the feel. These seem extra durable.  These have cover plates with a matte finish, which will definitely feel different from the cover plates on most harmonicas. The finish is a little rougher on the lips than the usual cover plates you will find on most harps. The matte finish cover plates are less smooth. This is not a deal breaker for me, just bugs me a bit sometimes.  These have a great resonance to them.. hard to explain what I mean by that.. while playing, they resonate, or vibrate more in my hand. This feels cool. Good sustain too. When I play a note and take my hand away, it's almost like I can still hear the note a bit, and can definitely feel the harmonica resonating more than most.  The Blues DeVille has phosphor bronze reeds, which supposedly last longer than brass reeds found in harmonicas made by Hohner and Lee Oskar. Phosphor bronze provides a different tone than brass, which you may or may not like.  I am not aware of any replacement reed plates being available for this harmonica. Some other brands, such as Lee Oskar and Bushman, sell replacement reed plates for their harps. Hopefully, the phosphor bronze reeds in this harmonica will last a long time.  This harp is a little wider than the Hohners and lots wider than the Lee Oskars (which are too narrow, in my opinion), but not so wide that switching back and forth between the BD and other brands will be difficult.  The plastic comb is fairly comfortable while tongue-blocking, though not quite as comfortable as the comb on the Hohner Special 20.  You might be wondering how the Blues DeVille compares to the Hohner Blues Harp..  BH has a thick wooden comb that is really really rough on the tongue when tongue blocking. Also, Blues Harps tend to require more air. They are not air tight. The BD is airtight. Blues Harps, unlike the Blues DeVille, do not have side vents, and are therefore quieter. Blues Harps have brass reeds.  Both the BD and BH have reed plates that stick out past the comb. Both have reed plates that are sharp at the edges, so you'll have to be careful playing the lowest and highest notes.  I've found the reed plates of the BD to be more comfortable and easier on the lips than the reed plates on the Blues Harps. However, the Blues Harp cover plates are more comfortable than the BD cover plates.  I find the Blues DeVille to be far superior to the Blues Harp.  But.. I've owned four Blues DeVilles, and three of them arrived with cases that were almost impossible to open, and therefore useless. Not cool, Fender!  Also, I bought a Blues DeVille in the key of C. The first one I got shipped was defective. The #10 draw note was quite noticeably flat. I sent that one back. The second one in C was great. Key of A, and key of G both great, but only the one in the key of A came with a functional case.  If it weren't for the case, I'd give this harmonica 5 stars. This one and the Hohner Special 20 (which is quite different from the Blues DeVille) are my two favorites.  How are this one and the SP20 different?  SP20 has smooth, comfortable reed plates. That harmonica also has a comb that sticks out further than the reed plates for extra comfort and no sharp edges on the ends of the harmonica. The SP20 comb feels a bit better (but only a bit) when tongue-blocking. It is a tiny bit easier to play single notes on the SP20. It is a lot lighter, but probably less durable. The SP20 has no side vents, and is therefore quieter. That harmonica also has a cleaner tone than the Fender Blues DeVille. I've found the SP20's to be a bit less airtight than the Blues DeVille. SP20's have brass reeds, which might wear out quicker than the BD's reeds. The SP20's I've bought all came with cases that work as they should, in other words, the cases open and close properly.  So why do I play a BD as much as an SP20? I love the tone and feel (with the exception of the matte finish) of the Blues DeVille. Actually, most of the time, the matte finish doesn't bother me at all, and is an interesting change. I like having some variety. Since these harps look, feel, and most importantly sound different from each other, variety is what I get, by owning both.","The harmonica is excellent, but came with a defective case.",1440633600,7.0,,,vent case give second resonance heavy breaker hard away plastic air deville much importantly hand find bh quite bug tongue i've work longer devilles smooth like oskars come reed wide quicker extra however noticeably four comfort properly actually might bd ship usual resonate open lot last problem tight useless wear get folk harmonicas replacement i'd take change definitely harp careful great feel phosphor quieter sell different note feel tongue-blocking wondering superior therefore harmonica good less provide find long unlike low fairly interesting sustain thick little star finish really draw one play love lot back deal make light rough bronze sharp high defective far matte hohner favorites easy loud durable good own single exception bushman probably comfortable reed first bit almost cool variety time mind hopefully own block get fantastic stick plate sometimes hear vibrate narrow wider also rougher switch key close still end lip lee edge cleaner explain brand functional brass forth arrive blue aware opinion difficult sound send tend airtight side fender buy case require bother bd's special play stick word since two gritty hohners mean cover wooden though include look seem comb harp impossible supposedly flat tiny resonate tough tone available past note three may oskar compare

Here's my take on how they stack up.  The 1847's are larger than the others and also have the ""largest"" tone...they are slightly louder than the others.  Stainless reeds are more difficult to gap or tune, and I'm not sure that they really are any more durable than those from Suzuki or Hohner.  The 1847 does have a really nice sound to it, and you can tell that Seydel put some money into it.  The reed-plate screws are self-tappers and will strip out if you're not careful, or if you remove them too many times.  Promasters have a look and feel to them, that makes you think they should cost a lot more (construction is very similar to the Meisterklasse, but cost about half as much).  They also play well.  manjis also play well and have a slightly darker tone, but the coverplates bend easily.  Crossovers have the fastest, most sensitive response of any harp I've ever played.

I own this and also a Deering Eagle II that cost more than five times as much, and I have owned cheap imports as well. This Goodtime is closer to the Eagle II in terms of sound and playability than it is to the cheap imports. In other words, it plays well above its class. The sound is surprisingly bright and loud for an open-back, and the low action and light-gauge strings make it very easy to play. Deering clearly gives the Goodtime a lot of the quality workmanship that goes into their professional-caliber banjos, but keep the cost affordable by minimizing the frills. For example, the Goodtime has 1/3 fewer brackets than a typical banjo. It has no separate fretboard (the neck is the fingering surface), the wood is unstained, it uses guitar tuners rather than planetary tuners, the tension hoop is not plated, and it has no side fret markers, no tone ring, no armrest, and of course no resonator (various other Goodtime models are available that are stained and have planetary tuners and/or have a resonator and/or a steel tone ring, at commensurately higher prices). But the truth is that none of that really matters much for the purposes of any beginner or intermediate banjo student, and even for pretty much anyone who is just playing recreationally. All that matters is that it sounds and plays great, and it does! In fact, this entry-level Goodtime has some advantages over expensive professional-grade models. It's extremely light, weighing in at a mere 4 pounds (thanks in part to its minimal hardware and lack of any tone ring), making it easy to carry and easy to hold, even for a child or an adult with a bad back. This is a banjo you don't mind bringing with you camping or to the beach, unlike a heavy expensive one. The smooth satin finish allows your hand to glide easily up and down the neck, whereas the heavy gloss finish on expensive banjos can create more friction and feel draggier. And the Goodtime's guitar tuners are actually more precise than the planetary tuners on my Eagle II. Deering does sell a separate add-on armrest for the Goodtime banjo, if you really must have one (standard armrests won't fit because of the very wide bracket spacing). I bought it, and it was easy to install. Deering also sells a resonator kit if you later decide you want to upgrade from open-back to resonator (if you're reasonably sure you're going to eventually want a resonator, it probably makes more sense to just get the resonator model from the outset rather than add a resonator later--and you can always opt to just take the resonator off. But it's simply nice to know that you do also have the option of adding a resonator later--you're not necessarily committing to an open-back by buying this model. When I bought my open-back Goodtime and finally had a truly well-made, quality, nice sounding, playable banjo in my hands for the first time, I just wanted to play it all the time. I found it to be a real joy compared to the inferior imported banjos I had struggled with in the past. In fact, I loved it so much that I decided right away that I just had to have one of the upper-line Deerings and bought my Eagle II (I pretty much fell in love with this company and its products!). But that was just to satisfy my enthusiasm--the truth is, this simple open-back Goodtime would have been plenty sufficient for all my present and future purposes. If you're going to be playing in a band or in large open venues, you may want to spend a little more for one of the Goodtime models that have a resonator (Goodtime Two) or a tone ring (Goodtime Special Open-Back) or both (Goodtime Special). But whichever Goodtime you choose, it is an outstanding banjo for a beginner and it's still pretty outstanding for any banjo player of any skill level, short of a professional!",There is very little reason to get any other banjo than this one!,1438732800,7.0,{'Color:': ' MultiColored'},,player know minimize camping product nice away fret go stain clearly joy much and/or advantage hand bright fretboard none playability entry-level friction marker planetary resonator price glide extremely smooth sell love wide banjo beach adult model banjo surface thanks level later--you're simply add venue actually matter expensive cost action draggier fell mere beginner open time hold create professional can't get upgrade anyone enough eventually take professional-grade sure buying great make simple sell later steel feel hand must want real pound find unlike play ring surprisingly opt sufficient little student finish add-on few really course one fact play deering struggled part model love lot satin term quality back future right bring hoop professional-caliber sense option compare separate low ii go own loud give sound weigh necessarily company satisfy recreationally add probably child large import truly fit upper-line first lack goodtime high bracket light tuner cheap want commit well-made neck time decide mind outstanding would various present spend standard armrest truth bad also later--and enthusiasm--the still goodtime's finally even intermediate close reasonably open-back easy five easily gloss plenty purpose band install wood guitar sound workmanship space unstained skill make side armrest buy choose class inferior short special play whereas bracket past word finger pretty two ting import whichever playable tension typical commensurately plat sound wonderful make allows kit frill heavy tone precise well light-gauge available decide hardware say example outset affordable always deerings eagle minimal carry us may keep string rather

The SE50 if pretty comfortable to wear, and the ear piece can be adjusted nicely to achieve a snug and stable yet pretty comfortable fit. This is important if you're going to be moving around much while wearing it. The mic boom is also adjustable, and is essentially ""bendy"" and can be manipulated into nearly any shape - and it stays there.  The sound quality of recordings with the SE50 are fabulous, as are those amplified through a PA system. If you properly position the tiny mic to be near the corner of the mouth and not touching your face - you will be impressed by the richness and consistency of the sound quality. This mic rivals any others, some that cost far more money.  The SE50 is nicely equipped and packaged, and comes with many adapters and attachments (most of which I haven't used yet) to fit various proprietary wireless system connections, such as Sony and Sennheiser.  This is actually where I have a little bit of a complaint. The 2.5mm jack includes a screw-in connection to make it compatible with Sennheiser - but it makes it difficult to use with some other connections because the screw-in securing ring is spring loaded and causes the jack to literally pop out.  I can connect okay to a jack if I am going to keep things pretty still, but if I'm going to move around - I often loose the connection. Some extension cables (for when I want to be hard wired instead of wireless) won't accept the jack at all.  I have searched for an adapter to solve this, but have yet to find one.  My only other complaint, which is minor, is that the cord is fairly short. I realize that it is intended for use almost exclusively with wireless systems, and the wearer will also be wearing the transmitter - but sometimes you must be creative with how you wrap the cord in, around, and through clothing and other gear - and this cord can get really short, really fast.  So, two relatively minor complaints aside - I give the SE50 four solid stars and recommend it. The quality is superb, and so far it has been durable and reliable.

1777,83267,3,False,"10 12, 2013",A3N0P5AAMP6XD2,B000ZKSYPS,H B,"It works pretty good, has a LOT of feats.  Here are the caveats for me:  It's more made for guitars than bass, here's why:  Because of the many options and setting, it's a bit overwhelming in the beginning for using it. When starting it the first time, they did not make an easy 'dry' or 'line' setting without effects. Even after using it for 1,5 hours, I still need to figure out how to easily disable all the extra effects like cabs emulations, eq, and effects like reverb, chorus, flanger, etc... It starts out with a good setting for guitarists (some kind of distortion cab), but it sounds horribly on the bass.  The volume of the instrument is too low compared to the volume of the backing tracks.  I bought this device to rehearse bass guitar, with some drum tracks; but it took me nearly 20 minutes to figure out how to remove the bass lines from the drum tracks; while at the same time there is no guitar backing track. In other words, backing tracks are metronome, drums, or drum+bass; which is awesome for guitarists, but calling it a guitar and bass effects processor, I had hoped they would at least have given the same amount of options for bass, as they did for guitar. The bass is in disadvantage here; as it not only is focused more on guitar effects, also there is no 'drum + guitar' backing track for bassists!  Most common bass effects are also hard to get. A lot of effects that don't work well, or don't sound good with a bass.  I wished they had a 'bass' and 'guitar' setting, allowing most of the bass effects to be easily used, and one does not have to browse through tens of guitar cabs and effects before one useable bass effect or cab pops up.  The device comes without an AC adapter, and the DC adapter input is negatively phased, meaning every regular 5V USB power adapter doesn't work. The USB plug is only to transfer data, not to power the device, but the DC plug on the device does not work with your standard 4-5V power adapter, neither any USB to DC Plug adapter (due to being negatively phased).  It doesn't have a mini jack 3mm out for line or headphones. Only a stereo jack out for 6mm jack headphones. When connecting it to the line in of any amplifier, one can overdrive the input on the line. It is possible however, to plug a mono device in the stereo output.  It doesn't have a logical menu system. There is no 'ok' or 'enter', and 'back' or 'return' option to correct a value. The 'exit' button goes back to the main menu, not to be used to correct incorrectly inputted values. The enter that there most of the time has a 'rec' option connected, meaning you want to change a value and press enter, and the device starts recording instead of entering a certain effect parameter. There are no direct buttons to change cab and effect settings. These settings have to be modified via not an easy to handle a crosshair pad (cross + buttons), which takes away of the ease and useability of the device (meaning it takes longer to get out of it, what you want to get out of it).  Overall it seems to be a useful device, but it's missing a belt clip; which could make this device from an effects processor, also to be used as a guitar/instrument amplifier; the main reason I bought this device is to be able to amplify my instrument; and I know a VOX or Rockman guitar to headphones amp could have done this, but this device is the only bass trainer with drum backing tracks available atm.

However, it is a solid wood guitar with a really fast, comfortable neck. The stock humbuckers are very serviceable. It has a pretty standard tremelo unit that is fine if you are not into dive-bombing the whammy bar. The tuning machines are just OK, but easy and cheap to replace. The guitar is nice looking - I can't tell if the top is a photo or real flame, but it's pretty anyway. Good deferentiation with the 3-way toggle, and some nice tones from the pickups.  This is not a Gibson Les Paul, but it's not $3000.00 either. For the money, this is a fine little guitar. Mine arrived with the shaft for the 3-way toggle switch broken off, but it took me all of 30 minutes to fix that. The action needed adjustment, but the intonation was good - another few minutes of tweaking got the action where I liked it without any string buzz. The frets are fairly well dressed and polished, and appear to be evenly set. So I am very happy with my purchase.  One possible note of caution: Chinese-made, low end instruments are notorious for inconsistent quality control. You might get a great one, or you might get a crummy one.

The sound is perhaps very slightly different from the SM57's -- and you can find comparison recordings online to see what you think -- but the ATM650 is just as good, in my opinion, with a noticeable boost in the upper midrange (and not that much bass, by design) to allow whatever you point it at to cut through clearly and crisply.  The typical intended use will be to mic an instrument -- say, an electric guitar cabinet or a snare drum, with the 650 pushed pretty tightly up to the instrument/sound source to isolate it from its surroundings -- but the 650 will sound okay with whatever you point it at, including vocals (not exceptional, but certainly usable). It rejects off-axis sound very well, just as designed.  Durability should be great: the ATM650 is a super-solid, heavily built unit, and it has a big advantage as a dynamic mic (as opposed to condensers, which are more fragile).

This mic helps solve the problem of getting an acoustical sound from an f-hole guitar. I use a pickup plus a mic. It's a dual-source system. The pickup (with some EQ filtering) doesn't get the highs (treble) without introducing unwanted hissing noise. The Audio Technica Pro 70 mic captures those crisp highs nicely and I always switch the low-cut on. Of course the two signals have to be blended together, which is easy enough with a small Xenyx mixer.  Mic placement is important. Some websites say to place a mic 10 inches away from the guitar. I don't agree. The Audio Technica Pro 70 mic should be much closer than that, like an inch away from the sound hole (if you place it right in the sound hole it will be too boomy sounding). For my f-hole guitar it's about 1/4 of an inch away (see my photo). I only need about 1/4 volume from the mic. The other 3/4 comes from the pickup.  I tried several other mics, as well and even tried placing one inside the guitar (which sounds boxy). The  Audio Technica Pro 70 mic sounds best for a sub-$200 mic.

Since it's a modeling amp it needs to recreate many different tones. The TH pulls it off well - much better than the Vypyr's stock speaker. The Vypyr in stock form sounds decent. But its speaker has a pretty thick/heavy cone and it is relatively hi-fi sounding. The result is that the amp sounds a bit sterile. The TH solved that.

However, that might be more a reflection on my set up than the capo and people who report buzzing may have different string heights.  The only problem I have with the capo, and the reason for 4 stars is there is metal flashing from the molds above the padding on the portion that lies on the strings.  It extends about 1/3 the thickness of the padding.  It doesn't touch the strings, but it reflects poor finishing of the metal portion as released from the molds and it bothers me, and I will likely take it out to my shop and file it off - one day.  Overall, I highly recommend the product.  Update:  After one year of light use (used it maybe 30 times in my room), never abused, never left my house.

When Elixirs came onto the market over 10 years ago I was skeptical, but they quickly proved themselves under tough conditions and have continued to improve. I can count on Elixirs to sound great on my Martin acoustics for weeks on end, no matter what I am doing. My string life didn't just double, it improved by a factor of 5 or more!  This weekend (1/28/12) was a case in point - I had a big show to do and my Elixirs were finally kaput after several MONTHS of use on my favorite small Martin. I couldn't find any Elixirs locally, and so grabbed a new set of another very well known (and perfectly good) brand of strings, also coated. The result: I killed those strings in one hot and heavy night of acoustic music. The show was sold out and fantastic, but the strings gave out. For Elixirs it would have been just the first night of many.  I use both the 80/20 and Phosphor Bronze strings for different guitars.

1941,106188,5,False,"03 20, 2010",A1ZUAEHZMQWP38,B001QWBM62,D. H. Preuss II,"I have used the H4n for over a year now, average 9 hours of recording a week, small and large venues, using the built in mics and direct inputs off a soundboard.  I love using this recorder, every detail but one is great. The other  reviews are accurate.  This won't handle a normal line level.  I use a small mixer in between the H4n and my front of house mixer signal just to step the signal down.  I have had to go to extremes to step the signal down in other situations, like taking the signal off a mixer and running it through an old boom box with an aux in, and back out the head phone jack of the boombox then into the Zoom.  You can use anything to step it down, but what an unreasonable pain.  What were they thinking?  I have been in several situations where I didn't have anything to step the signal down, and lost the recording opportunity.  That being said, is it worth buying the Zoom H4n?  Without a doubt, YES!  I recorded a piano concert the other night, I placed the H4n inside the piano with a boom stand about a foot off the stings, back a foot and a half from the hammers, and set my mic levels.  Once the recording was complete I shared it with a university level music instructor.  He was amazed by the quality of the recording.  I have a friend who has been a top notch, professional, big name recording engineer in the past, he is also an amazing piano player.  He listened to the recording I got off that piano.  His jaw was dropped the whole time.  He said it was good enough to master, studio quality easily.  He picked up on the noise floor which is present... because it wasn't done in a studio... it was taken in a small chapel with maybe 30 uncouth participants who were making plenty of noise and driving me nuts.  Sometimes we take things too seriously, huh?  or maybe they just didn't know that I was tracking an amazing performance that would be worth putting on a CD... except for their talking, rustling, opening and closing doors... it all shows up on the recording... along with every detail of every note played on that piano, all in full stereo with great separation, complete left to right panned pick up of the full scale of the piano... everything is crystal clear and perfectly accurate.  The recording encompasses you and captivates you.  The stereo field of this recorder is breathtaking.  I have recorded full sets with drums, bass, keyboard, guitar, electric guitar and vocals with effects, everything I do is Christian, these sets were jazz and rock genre... in a sound insulated room... and the musicians agree everything sounds like it was picked up in a studio.  Every detail of the drums is present, the attack, the presence, the resonance of each hit.  Same with the other instruments and voices, you can hear every detail of every instrument and voice in the set.  The sound in the room was well balanced and aligned and the musicians were great, the noise floor was very low, so it all came together with this recorder and now I have some sweet tracks.  Not bad for the investment in the H4n.  As far as the signal quality of the built in mics on the H4n is concerned, I have never detected even a trace of self noise from the mics, and they pick up the full frequency range completely.  I have recorded at concert level volumes with plenty of headroom left before risk of clipping.  Unlike the line level adjustments, the mic level adjustments are very adequate.  Recordings in small venues don't sound perfectly clear because of the noise floor. In large venues they are even worse. Don't blame the recorder for less than perfect live recordings... it's the background noise that kills the recording quality. Like I say I have recorded with the H4n in sound insulated (studio) environments... and the recorder is perfect!  If your environment is clean from noise your recordings will be as clear and perfect as you could ever dream... the recorder picks up every high, and every low, and everything in between perfectly, accurately, through it's built in mics.  If you step your line level signals down, it records perfectly directly.  The remote is handy for setting your levels as it indicates with LEDs when you are within 6db of clipping.  Don't trust the LCD display levels, they can show the signal is within range but your button lights are flashing because your hardware is clipping.  Go by the button lights or the remote LEDs; if they aren't blinking red, then set your levels by the LCD.  Most of my recordings are off a little mixer with an adjustable output for the tape out, so line level is not a problem in my most frequent application.  I have a few bits of advice.  My rep at Sweetwater talked me into a set of Beyerdynamics DT770 pro headphones.  They are terribly expensive; I argued that I have a set of Sennheiser HD280's and thought they were unbeatable.  I didn't realize they were missing everything under 70Hz.  Until you listen to recordings through a real pair of studio-grade headphones you don't realize what is really available in a recording for your ears to hear and what you have been missing without them.  The Beyerdynamics bring that much out of your music. I would recommend them to anyone who is taking the time to create or record music; invest in a good set of cans.  Next I would recommend my favorite sound editing software, Audacity.  It is FREE.  It is worth the learning curve.  It is fast in it's performance.  It is perfect for the tracks and mixes you will be picking up with the H4n.  You need good editing software to get the most of your recording experience. Audacity is great for chopping up your recordings into separate songs, making them ready instantly to put on a CD. It is great for mixing the tracks you pick up with the mics and at the same time with your direct inputs. The  EQ in this program is amazing once you get used to drawing curves, you can EQ extremely precise... if you can hear the details in your recordings... (thus the recommendation for the good headphones).  When first learning to use this program print out the help files on selecting your audio ranges for editing... and practice on a track.  Once you are used to it you will love it.  I spend at least 20 hours a week using this software.  I have used Free Audio Editor a lot, too.  It has the most intuitive interface but it is slow; editing with it takes a lot of time.  Also, it is not free for their full feature version.  I have used WavePad a bit, you might try it, the free version is pretty complete. The parameters of the EQ in Audacity are superior, though the real time interface of WavePad effects is priceless.  I really like the compressor and its interface in WavePad.  I have Cubase AI4 and can't even grasp the learning curve for it, it is way over my head without serious time to devote to figuring it out; plus it is not even free.  All this, of course, is personal opinion.  Don't do your sound editing without a programmable mouse.  You need to have the frequent commands at your finger tips when editing sound.  Take the time to assign hot keys to your frequent commands, how and where you want them.  Invest in dual monitors.  Video cards are cheap, monitors are virtually free at thrift stores or garage sales, flatscreens are inexpensive now.  I use dual 19"" monitors for my editing, and a third smaller flatscreen for other apps.  Couldn't be happy without them.  Other notes on the H4n: If you need a power supply with a longer cord the Tascam PS-P520 power adaptor works perfectly and reaches about 12'.  Identical connector, same voltage and polarity, twice the rating, twice the cord reach.  If you are using the unit outdoors or near even the slightest breeze you need the windscreen, and I would recommend an aftermarket fuzzy one.  Without a windscreen ANY breeze sounds like a tidal wave crashing over the recorder.  Also, don't expect to hold the unit in your hand while recording, any movement with your hand sounds like a building falling on top of the recorder.  The H4n comes with a flawed extra, beware.  It comes with a mic clip adapter, which is shaped like the stem of a microphone and screws into the back of the recorder so you can put the recorder in a mic stand.  Two problems.  The adapter is too small for the average mic clip on a mic stand.  I had to wrap mine with a thin piece of leather so a mic clip would hold it securely.  But really beware.  The adaptor thing, about 4 inches long, is made of two parts of plastic, the cone part and the top part that has a metal screw thread sticking out of it.  The two pieces of plastic are glued together.  The glue doesn't hold!  You screw the thing into the back of your recorder and stick it in a mic clip on a mic stand 6' off the floor... and the adapter comes apart! If you are lucky your precious recorder just falls into your hand... if you are not lucky it falls to the floor!  I had to use primer and Black Plastic Pipe dope to fuse the two pieces of plastic together so I wasn't risking having my recorder fall to the floor from 6' up!  As far as cables go, watch out for Hosa 1 / 4 "" connectors.  First time I used Hosa cables I could barely get them disconnected from the recorder... it took way too much force to remove them.  The unit doesn't play well with Hosa connectors.  Other makes fit perfectly.  Before you buy, check out the Zoom Q3 video recorder.  If you are looking to record just with the built in mics this thing is cheaper, has the same mics.  Don't expect to carry it around and get clear sounding recordings, as stated above, it will pick up handling noise terribly.  Enjoy the H4n.  Hopefully Zoom fixes the line level issue and then they will have the perfect recorder.","great mics, great unit, doesn't handle normal line levels",1269043200,43.0,{'style:': ' H4n (2009 model)'},,player figure wavepad accurately interface think finger pro power jack maybe windscreen performance realize rustle apps ear drive come ever say align select slow supply risk inch scale room try problem software get indicate favorite connector thing open expect lcd barely building insulate buy direct make force christian flaw note learn superior store happy range really sweetwater primer part application right unreasonable audio attack soundboard nut far volumes yes state ready step bit cheap version thus hosa would sale metal hear mic wave everything track bad adequate encompasses mics small work boombox hit easily remove pick participant sound experience show plus cone build presence thrift run door stick set two recorded instrument without beware risk noise programmable crashing shape go precise year hardware do frequency note fuse every aftermarket small know captivate uncouth phone house plastic notch black card breathtaking much thought rock remote record recording button enjoy recorder blame like vocal extra level trace practice could week take agree amaze might fuzzy listen normal hold apart can't clip track several share detected instrument curve name within headphone screw talk curve university effect problem serious program tascam parameter mix place long print floor sting pair one drop instantly leather love make whole electric huh sweet securely crystal signal perfectly worth self accurate first adaptor fix help time range spend top friend mixer buy dope cd also inexpensive voice inside tidal beyerdynamics listen adjustment reach put tip pick priceless glue doubt old though take breeze assign polarity chop grasp use invest piece recommendation personal clear editor pan fall record resonance virtually cable play closing command hand use head genre investment longer microphone extremely red recommend hour piano average song near venue need half instructor opportunity expensive hot professional create night next unit least environment bad anyone enough voice take stick big third edit output bass advice intuitive less cord box flash music leave thread boom little handling thing set outdoors course movement lot back quality mix separate low seriously situation good free set take use fit talk come trust watch draw get voltage dream slight present mouse background part compressor sometimes check level separation plenty file front fast concerned garage unbeatable identical rating zoom chapel audacity rep adjustable field piece concert along aux screw sound well say can cubase argue look stand fall drum clip adapter extreme track master directly studio-grade detail foot keyboard dual glue stem way feature jaw handy led wrap environment perfect completely flatscreens flatscreen lucky video fall high devote pick great sennheiser take terribly amazing real clean mine connector pain handle balance unlike line put record stereo play miss issue precious live reach sound lost twice large together cheap signal light want studio full frequent thin display kill hopefully pick complete even except musician opinion monitor guitar eq disconnect headroom never key bring input review around pipe hammer blink make detail engineer jazz bit past available show carry anything tape pretty

It appears very well constructed with classic Fender Telecaster design although the head stock is more like a Les Paul.  I'm a guitarist who was drafted into a uke group and they lent me a baritone uke.  The baritone's strings are the same tuning as the 4 highest pitch strings of the guitar, DGBE, so the learning curve wasn't an issue but when I had to return the loaner I ordered ""Mabel"".  Yes, I named it Mabel because it sounds like maple. This is a tenor and the strings are strung a 4th higher than the baritone so I had to use different fingerings for the chords e.g. when I see a G, the tenor requires a shape like a D on guitar or bari uke.  So, a bit of frustration and lots of updating my song sheets so I could view the new patterns per song rather than have to jump to a massive tenor uke chord chart, which is I also use.  Now I'm deep into it, including doing some basic jazz II-VII-I stuff.  I mostly play it unamplified to keep the peace in the home and really, I enjoy that almost as much as amplified. It came strung as re-entrant, i.e. the 4th string, G, is an octave higher than you would expect then the other strings are ""normal"".

I decided to try several of the popular harps in the 50-70 dollar range before I buy a complete set.  So far this is my favorite.  I am a big fan of harmonica-professional Brendan Power and he is an official spokesperson for Suzuki.  He had a hand in creating this semi-valved (as he calls it) version of the Promaster.  It has such a solid feel and beautiful looks that it is hard to believe that it is so affordable considering it is a professional grade instrument.  The notes are clear and it has great tone.  It takes some practice to draw on the lower notes but many harps are like that.  The harmonica seems to WANT to bend notes, kind of like it's encouraging me to do that.  My harmonica instructor was so envious of me.  He thinks that I should stick with this one even though he plays Hohner Special 20s.  I will update this review as I get more experience with it.

I was on a pretty tight budget at the time and it really was all I could afford. There are a lot of reviews about this pedal and one pretty universal complaint is that the AC adapter has to be 12 volt. I did however read on a different website that a 9 volt adaptor would actually work in place of the 12V. I have not tried this myself but it might be something to try if you already have this pedal or something to research if you don't. It would make it compatible with your pedalboard power supply if it does. Battery life seems to be pretty good. You have to pull the input 1/4"" wire out of the pedal to turn it off which for me is not ideal as I sometimes forget. I did leave it on for about 18 hours and the battery was still good so I will guess it has good longevity. There is a small red LED on the side that will show you battery status and hopefully remind you to disconnect it but good luck with that. The pedal is not particularly heavy and I have trouble because I have it under the keyboard and I have to extend my foot to put it on the pedal and it tends to walk away a bit on a bare floor.  If you are a guitar player you might not have that problem but be aware of it anyway. You won't find a cheaper pedal, but if you don't need it right away save up and perhaps get something a bit better if you can afford it. If not, this one will get you by for sure.",Good low cost soloution,1371859200,2.0,,,player adapter compatible away power foot find keyboard work red complaint however hour ideal supply could need fine actually might try guess disconnect walk battery tight get luck volt tend seem problem something sure already trouble different longevity budget well read put floor really one website input lot turn place right pull afford good cheap bit adaptor lead time purchase hopefully perhaps would particularly sometimes extend pedalboard still anyway leave remind universal aware guitar make side volume review status forget try life bare wire heavy research show save ac pedal small pretty

The length (too long) ended up being not a problem for me.   The padding on this is just spectacular! Absolutely comfortable, and my shoulder no longer dreads long sessions.

2072,190947,5,True,"11 21, 2015",A3RDQG0LZRGWAZ,B014Q9YUKG,G. Poirier,"Sound on videos is vastly underrated. Having good sound will make a big difference. This SmartMixer is a great choice for making videos or movies on the iPhone. I graduated from USC's film school and have made my share of student and amateur films and videos. I've used some pro equipment and 'prosumer' equipment. This takes your iPhone into the broadcast quality category, I think. And, with everything you get, it's a great value. You get multiple cables, a bracket to mount your phone to a tripod, a hand grip to hold the whole thing, two mics, and the mic adapter/meter/amp.  The most difficult thing in getting good sound in a video is the distance from the subject to the microphone. That's why professionals use boom mics, those big poles with a condenser mic, usually, hanging off the end. Someone holds it overhead to get it as close to speaker and action without the camera seeing it. Right? But, maybe you don't have a sound man to follow you around. With this rig alone, you can get pretty good sound all by yourself.  I looked around a lot for something that would get me better sound. External mics for the iPhone, or another mobile video phone, are not that easy to find. Most of them seem very inadequate. The headphone input on the iPhone takers a 3.5mm (1/8"") mini-jack that has the TRRS configuration. For non-geeks, this means when you look at the little thing you plug into the phone (the jack) it has three rings. Most headphone jacks have two. The third one allows them to include a microphone on the headphones. So, if you want the plug in a mic into your iPhone, it needs the three rings. A lot of mics don't have that. They have two. With this SmartMixer, you get a device that adapts any two ring mics so you can use them with your phone. Just plug them in. It also is an amp and will boost your sound somewhat. (Don't expect it to perform a miracle. It will adjust the sound but it won't act like a ""spy microphone"" and pull in mouse fart at fifty yards or anything close to that.) If that weren't enough, it also has a visual meter and headphone output so you can check your sound and make sure you're getting what you want. Not monitoring your sound would be like shooting a video without being able to see the picture. You wouldn't do that!  The included mics are remarkably good. I was surprised. I have shot a couple videos with them, sitting a few feet away from the camera and rig. Let's say about four feet. The sound was clear, easy to hear, and the mics didn't pic up a lot of room echo. I even tried hooking up my Audio Technica shotgun mic, a pro quality mic, to the rig and I thought the sound was better with the little mics that came with it! If you're surprised to read that, I was even more surprised when I heard it! My shotgun mic is about fifteen years old and has some mileage on it. I don't know if it is worse for the wear or what. But, if you want to get some good sound, the included mics will work.  They will not perform magic. If the place where you are shooting is noisy or you are too far from the camera, be prepared to have the sound suffer.  This rig allows you to plug in other mics as well. It can accept, for example, a lavalier mic so you can get a good close sound on someone speaking. It will take any mic that has a ""mini-jack"" style output with two rings (not the three like an iPhone headphone has) which is standard for most mics that have a small jack, the 1/8"" or 3.5 mm. And the meters and dials allow you to balance the sound. You can plug in headphones to check your sound, too, a must if you want good results. There is also a mini-XLR input on the side and the rig includes a cable that goes from standard XLR to mini-XLR so you can use any professional mic.  The only way to move up from this would be to get a professional mixer and probably a separate recorder so you can add sound later.  If that wasn't enough, the rig includes a really good bracket that holds your iPhone and can be screwed onto a standard tripod attachment or you can attach it to the included hand grip stick. Yes, that's included, too! So, you can put it all together and be fully mobile, with the SmartMixer atop your iPhone and shot video with good sound! There are two different cables to connect the SmartMixer to your iPhone headphone jack so you can record.  The SmartMixer takes a 9volt battery. It seems to last for several hours. I have used my rig for about three hours total and don't need to change the battery yet.  Bottom line: I am very happy with this purchase. I make short instructional videos for my English classes and also some ""vlog"" style videos on my own about my projects at home, especially lately landscaping and gardening in my back yard. This SmartMixer gives me very decent sound at a good price. You've got to pay if you want professional sound. It isn't easy and it isn't cheap. But, this will make it so your amateur videos don't make sound so amateur if you use them right.

Speaking of user-friendly, I've tried other DAWs including spending a great deal of money on FL Studio, but making music with that DAW was very unorthodox in my opinion and I never really understood it. As soon as I installed the Maschine plus incuded software I was making beats instantly and full songs in one sitting. I don't know how Native Instruments did it, but this thing is super easy which leaves me questioning why other DAWs are so difficult to learn.

After looking at Behringer, Fender, Samson and Yamaha, I decided that the Peavy Escort 3000 best suited my immediate needs.  There are two different choices for this same unit.  This is the newer version and the extra channels and features were important for my needs.  That said, the price on the older model is tempting, assuming the sound quality is the same, which I cannot attest to.  Sound and volume:  You might need more for Carnegie Hall, but I suspect this will suit most people for a medium sized hall.  The built in equalizer allows you to fine tune the sound of whatever kind of music you might play.  Features:  Love the thumb drive input, although finding a song quickly is a problem if you have a large number of songs on the drive.  You can also quickly plug in a phone or tablet or laptop via the mini jack input, which is what I do.  There is also an RCA phono jack for other stereo input needs. The main inputs are slick as they accept 1/4"" plugs and 3 pin plugs typical in corded mics.  Portability:  It's not the lightest thing, but it has wheels, which makes it MUCH easier than lugging.  And all your mics , cables and stands all fit into the unit.  Speaker Stands:  This unit comes with stands that pack into the unit.  Although they are not the sturdiest or tallest, they are functional.  If you are setting up on a solid surface, you will be fine.  I don't know what to say about outdoors on grass. 5  Unit Stand:  This unit does not have a stand.  Most photos show the unit with a stand.  I did not buy the optional stand since I normally use a table provided by the venue.  But if you have an old keyboard (Casio, etc.), you might want to try the stand you had for that unit before buying one.  Cables:  The speaker cables for this unit are only 15 feet, so keep that in mind for your needs.  The older model comes with 25 foot cables, so I don't know why an extra few feet of wire couldn't have been included with the new unit.  The cost should not have been that much.  Overall, I could not be happier with this unit.

It is quite solid when fully assembled and tightened down. I have a NI S88 on the lower and an S60 on the upper with no worry about stability.  Couple of problems though -  First problem was - the top of the Z stand is not symmetrical - there is a left and a right part in the assembly of this. I got two right parts and as such the hole on that side would not line up for the welded nut while attaching the riser. I puzzled around with this for a while, figuring I was missing something in the assembly sequence, but nope. It ships partially assembled and I got two 'right' top Z rails. What to do? I could pack it all back up and return it - or - lay out and drill a new hole. I chose the latter.  With that done I was able to complete the basic assembly. Knowing how to mark and drill holes in steel would come in handy again as - Second problem is the stand is not drilled to sit low enough. Not sure how this got by the design team. I am 6'3"" and the hight of my 88 was about three inches too high when set to the lowest pre-drilled setting. Time to drill again - and again, no big deal - just annoyed that I had to. The last nit is there was a good sized ding in the end of the square top tube facing me as seated. It had to happen in the factory - as there were zero marks in the packaging to indicate it was shipping related. It gouged the rubber plug and left a sharp bur on the facing edge of that top tube. Solution was to pull the plug and file off the bur - again, not a big deal.

It can be handy for rehearsals and touring if the guitar in this case would be kept in the car or in the airplane cabin. Although I haven't used this case in a harsh touring mode, it seems to be well built and should last and protect your guitar if not throwing it on the rails, not stomping on it, or not putting it to the airplane luggage. For the airplane luggage or other harsh environments where you guitar could be thrown or falling down you would probably need a tough hard case. This case is good for caring on shoulders or in hand vertically or horizontally, has padding for your back, two handles, big pockets for accessories, thick zipper, interior protective pads in the guitar bridge and headstock area.  PLEASE NOTE: - this case has a label with California Proposition 65 warning (contains harmful chemicals) - this is NOT shown in the item description on Amazon, while it should, so beware; - if you have a tremolo bridge on your guitar you would need to unscrew the tremolo handle in order to fit it into the case; if you use the case often this may become very annoying; - this case fits most regular-shaped electric guitars, but I'm not sure about the large extreme shapes (didn't try it for them); it perfectly fits B.C. Rich Villain Veil with 25,5"" scale and 24 frets, leaving about one inch of extra space in length. The guitar sits very well inside when the case is closed, no wiggling.

2165,130437,3,True,"03 3, 2017",A3V9T4QQS8A5Z,B005NACC6M,Andy,"To preface, I don't want to make this sound too harsh, but 3 stars equates to ""It's ok"" which is exactly how I feel about this product.  The first reason it's just ""ok"" is: I wanted to use my stereo microphones that have a 3.5MM plug with this.  After I purchased it (before it arrived) I read another review where the person said it does NOT contain a 1/8 or 3.5MM stereo line input jack. They are correct.  I just figured all PCM recorders must have one. Nope!  You *can* convert your 3.5MM plug to 1/4"" with an adapter, then plug that into one of the XLR jacks on the bottom (which double as 1/4"" inputs as well.)  Unfortunately, those are mono inputs, so a stereo 3.5MM plug mic set becomes mono. Yes, it's not like it's a manufacturing flaw, but I would've liked to see this standard feature in a higher level model like this.  Again, to clarify, I'm not rating it a ""dislike,"" based on that, but they could've done better here.  I kept the DR-40, because one interesting thing you can do with it which I didn't expect is record drums fairly well.  You position the built in microphones to the outward position, then run a snare mic into an XLR port, and a kick mic into the other XLR port, and use the DR-40's '4 track' setting.  Hang it upside down from the ceiling a few feet over your kit.  The built in mics act as overheads, and the other 2 mics capture your most important parts.  Compared to what 2 overheads and a 4 track mixer would cost, this recorder is a deal just for that in itself.  I did mess with the overdub mode, and found that if you use the ""mix"" setting, you do tend to get ""drift"" described in other reviews.  I found this problem while trying to do a song with 5 part harmony, but here's a much simpler way to understand how the problem works:  Say you record a track into the built in microphones, and all you do is speak 1,2,3,4,5,6 .. 1,2,3,4,5,6 with one second between each number.  You switch to overdub mode, and turn on ""mix.""  Hit record twice, and you will hear yourself speaking the numbers.  On this track, you record yourself clapping each time you hear yourself say ""1.""  Hit stop.  Hit record twice again, and you'll hear yourself speaking the numbers, and clapping on the 1 count. On this mix, you will clap only when you hear yourself say ""2.""  Do this 6 times, and you should have a final recording of you speaking 1-6 twice, and  clapping on all beats (in theory.)  However, what drift does is causes the beats to not match up by the final recording.  You will notice some claps in the final product will not be exactly on the count, even though you recorded them correctly.  This is drift.  What does this mean to us end-users?  It means if your goal is to record perfectly synchronized ANYTHING with this DR-40 using overdub mix mode, you should instead record individual tracks (without the mix setting), then export them to a computer program, and synchronize them there.  Don't get me wrong, the audio quality of the recordings is excellent, the rest of the features are good, and it's very user friendly, and most importantly somewhat portable (although, you won't be sneaking it through the security line at a concert unseen.)  For those who have done their research, and want this product, it's probably 4 or 5 stars.  The XLR inputs with phantom power available area  great feature for a portable recorder, for sure.. it's just not exactly what I was looking for.","No 3.5MM / 1/8"" stereo line in.

In about 10 minutes I was dialed in and playing with a drummer and having zero issues with killer tone.  A couple important areas of note - the gain is not volume, it's actually gain. If you want to use zero gain with the output cranked, you're not getting anything from the pedal. The dials are super sensitive, and this is a great thing for getting a wide range of tones. Yes you can get Van Halen in a box (if you have the chops), you can get 80's era Metallica and nu-metal all in one box. Finally, it needs to be loud. The tones at band volume are absolutely terrific. Turned to very low output, you are essentially getting the same tone you would get from a $50 Boss DS-1. If you're a bedroom rocker, be ware.  So why four stars? Because it is very limited. Had the boost switch been usable for live applications where low gain could be boosted for a solo, maybe five. This is an expensive distortion pedal and there are many good options for $50-$75 less.

Another great aspect about these monitors: They have a huge ""sweet spot"" which can really come in handy and help eliminate monitoring mistakes.

Not all capos are worth the time and money. This one is a decent one, lightweight and easy to use. I have only minor complaints with it.

One thing that caught my attention about this capo is that it does have a little wobble in the hinge and it shifts a little when I open it one-handed. It is not enough to make it useless but it is enough to make me wonder if it will eventually become more loose and then be less effective. Time will tell.  In the meantime, it seems to work very well. It holds tightly on the neck, giving good tension on the strings with no buzz. It does not slip and slide easily which is good.

I looked at Lee Oskar Harmonicas, at the Suzuki, and other brands. Some guy named Ian Chadwick, for example, provides extensive coverage of his own experience with an amazing spectrum of brands and models within those [http://www.ianchadwick.com/essays/harmonicas.htm] which is worth checking out, as of course are the reviews you'll find here on Amazon. And yes, within Hohner there are other options besides the Special 20, the most notable perhaps being the Hohner Blues Harp. The difference between the Special 20 and the Blues Harp is mainly--so the story goes--in the comb, the part your mouth actually rests on and glides over. The Blues Harp is wood, the Special 20 plastic. Despite what you first might think, lots of players go for the plastic because it doesn't swell and warp with the large volume of--let's face it--spit that gets driven through a harp. I grew up playing cross-harp along with one of my best high school buddies as he strummed his guitar, and it's fun. Do check out the basic mapping from the key of the song to the so-called ""2nd position"" (aka cross-harp) key. For the likely songs you encounter in popular music, blues, etc, they seem to be as follows: KEY OF SONG / HARP KEY   E / A   F / B-flat   G / C   A / D   B / E   C / F   D / G This set gives you keys C, G, A, D, & E. There seems to be a consensus that if you buy F and B-flat you're pretty much set, though the Special 20 comes in 14 keys, maybe in case you want to play Mozart. These are so much better than the cheap Hohners I grew up playing, real musical instruments that produce sound effortlessly, bend notes with considerable expressiveness, and work very well on both the blow and the draw--if those are the right terms. I remember my cheap set being a trial for note-production on the draw notes. These are made in Germany, as printed on the harmonicas, and as stated on the Hohner website. Don't panic, the case of course is made in China, and that sticker is the first thing you see, of standard Case Logic type quality, but very nicely fitted for the harps plus space for a couple more, which in due course, for me, will be that F and that B-flat. Btw I also checked the price all over the 'verse (as they call it on Firefly), and every place has the same price, so you can just stop looking and get it here. Great way to enjoy playing music. I own a pretty complete set of tools for that job--nice Yamaha stage piano, Gibson Les Paul electric, Martin dreadnought acoustic, and recently a cool Yamaha electronic drum kit, which is the bee's knees, let me tell you. But this is the ultimate portable, entry-level musical instrument, very unpretentious, and honestly you can sound pretty passable on them soon enough that you won't toss them aside with a snarl of frustration. Also a great gift. But folks, don't play like Bob Dylan. I just bought the mono recordings box set of his first eight albums, and the guy, genius though he is, sounds like he's signaling ships at sea when he blasts that harp. I'm not the only one who seems to think his headache-inducing harmonica work renders many tracks unlistenable. Bobbie, think of the neighbors! I mean, am I missing something or is Mr. Robert Zimmerman truly bad at playing the harmonica?

First, the case.  The case is very important when learning if you take lessons out of the home or at school.  This case has a nice pouch for sheet music that is accessible without having to fully open the case.  Inside, it has a good lining, and room for any accessories you might need or want.  It's a protective case with a nice strap for carrying.  Wood instruments can swell if they get around too much moisture, or dry out if they don't have enough, that's why there is a Hygrometer in the case, so you can monitor that.  It comes pre-strung, which is going to be great for kids - they will be able to get excited about their new instrument as soon as it arrives.  The synthetic strings do need to be stretched out though, and it needs to be tuned, so don't judge the sound too harshly at first right out of the case if you are a parent.  It does NOT come with an electronic tuner - I really like those, they aren't much, and they can be bought here on Amazon too.  They are like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fender-Clip-On-Tuner-FT-004-for-Guitar-Ukulele-Bass-Violin-Mandolin-and-Banjo/dp/B005MR6IHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fender Clip-On Tuner FT-004 for Guitar, Ukulele, Bass, Violin, Mandolin, and Banjo</a>&nbsp;I like those because not only are they a lot of help getting an instrument tuned, but also they really help train the ear.  It is a pretty violin, with a nice soft finish and lovely wood grain showing. The pegs hold fine, and are easy to work with, and initial tuning didn't take too much effort.  The bow lost a few hairs right on the first use, but it's been fine since.  That's not unusual, the important thing was it didn't keep losing them when played subsequently, and it didn't loose too many.  For your money, I don't think you'd get a better package for the money.  The instrument itself sounds good, with a fairly warm, smooth clear sound, and should give any beginner a suitable enough instrument to learn on, until which time they gain enough proficiency and might know that they want to invest in one much more valuable.  Also with younger kids, and instruments getting carried around a lot, it gives them some training to be responsible for an instrument before you drop a ton of cash on a super nice one.  This sounds much better than the Mendini, another brand that is often bought for beginners.  The Mendini comes with a nice accessory package, like this, but the quality of the sound with this instrument is much, much better.  This is the better instrument, and should keep a student happier and with a better chance of success, soundwise, a good bit longer as they progress.  The case is going to be much more protective for students that are traveling to school/classes/recitals/concerts. That outer pouch comes in handy when you are sitting in tight concert formation - it's much easier to bend over to open an outside pouch under your chair and reach inside, than to have to lug a case out and up, open it, (bothering other students with your case in their lap),all the while holding your instrument, and finally replace it back under a chair.  That might seem like a small thing, but I know what that's like to lug a case around for 5 years or so on nearly a daily basis- and this one is going to be more comfortable in a lot of ways than a lot of case styles.",Good student package- nice sounding instrument- love the case- another important consideration for students,1473638400,,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813TkbbcUaL._SY88.jpg'],"give know tune sheet nice peg judge play much chance effort lovely use chair gain work longer small excite smooth like this:&nbsp;<a dry arrive way handy easy lesson need come electronic lap),all fine might think room soundwise open carry beginner hold tight soft get important ton instrument many enough thing clip-on take lose protective great ear beginner accessory initial bass learn train money tune bother well daily music fairly stretch brand student hygrometer student finish bend really nearly that's warm suitable one schoolchildren swell accessory replace package new lot quality back success show right line cash training responsible soon hold believe pre-strung go home good able synthetic lose subsequently sound parent give out outside comfortable monitor sit first amazon come super violin bit want school/classes/recitals/concerts grain school fully learn tuner banjo</a>&nbsp;i help time carry ukulele happy moisture unusual formation also accessible mandolin finally young data-hook=""product-link-linked inside strap easy class=""a-link-normal drop year wood guitar sound kid buy reach case proficiency need mendini around hair bow since basis often concert progress instrument without though seem sound travel valuable pouch invest get another loose lug harshly style keep clear string pretty"

I have realized that unbalanced cabling will create a slight amount of hiss/noise in the speakers, but my Focusrite only has TRS outputs and I only own TS cables... So I just used TS to XLR adapters on the speakers and connected to the XLR input and the speakers are dead silent. I understand that makes very little sense from an electrical standpoint, but hey it works. The speakers are still awesome, and they do translate well.  These speakers, are really nice, I was surprised at their weight, they are built pretty solid. They have a high end I've never experienced in this range. They put your music under a microscope and will make things sound bad.... these are not listening speakers.  Many complain about the bass, but you have to realize, these are 5"" monitors, you can't expect much from them. [just buy a subwoofer]. They have a EQ on the back for adjustments, and a 'Room Control' switch, which according to the manual, you can use to counter the effects of putting them near a wall or in a corner. I find myself never falling out of the sweet spot, its quite wide. Also, I wanted to mention that you can put TS cables in the TRS input, no issue. The speakers don't pop when you turn them on, you just get a pleasant light.

I was able to set up some basic settings and used it for the 1st time on New Years Eve. I have now played 6 gigs with it, have done some minor tweeking, but so far have loved using it. First 3 gigs ran through the power amp-in on 2 12"" combo amp. It sounded good. Then got to a gig, the lead players amp would not work I told him to use the amp I had been playing through and I played through a powered monitor. It sounded better. Then for last night's gig I got a new powered monitor and It was great. I play in an oldies, country and classic rock band. Most of my settings are clean or acoustic sims. This unit has some great acoustic settings right off the bat.  I basically used 4 user defined presets, each with up to four effects I can turn on or off. #1 is a clean twin: Efffect 1 is chorus, Effect 2 is tremelo, Effect 3 is clean boost,  effect 4 is slap echo and pedal is wah. #2 is acoustic: Effect 1 is chorus and Effect 2 is a 12 string sim using the octive effect. #3 is crunch: Effect 3 is boost and the amount of distortion is controlled by the pedal. #4 is distortion: Effect 1 is chorus, Effect 3 is boost and pedal controls amount of distortion.  It takes a while to learn how to tweek the parameters to one's liking. I have owned a number of Line 6 amps, pedals and variax guitars before so I had a head start. There are many usable presets in the unit. I do feel that the presets are very heavly into high gain settings, which are not what I use. However, there were enough clean and acoustic settings for me find ones I liked that I then modified further.

What a beautiful harp this is, feels very substantial in the hands, has a certain heft to it, defiantly heavier than my Manji.  One problem though, #10 Hole Blow/Draw is NOT! To Responsive, Out of the box, and seems to be a little sticky, I also have another Hammond, in the Key Bb and it plays GREAT! I am Hoping that with some playing it will break in that Not so lively, sticky #10 Hole Blow/draw.  Update: for Problem of the Sticky, POOR playing #10 Hole, Blow/Draw, I pulled the covers off, used a tooth pick, and Very Gently messaged the #10 hole, Blow and Draw reeds, pushing them up at the ends, and away from there seating position, moving them in this manner several times, moving them maybe 1/16""off there seat, then also did the #8 & #9 holes Blow/Draw reeds the same. This worked Great!, This Harp plays MUCH BETTER, It Actually plays Excellent!!! Now,  and Like my other Hammond Harp does, maybe even Better, This fixed the problem, i Will now give the Harp a 5+ star rating, up from 4 star rating. I realize that Any Manufacturing can have some product that is not quite up to standard, and some that get out the door, that are marginal, some may be better than standard, it is just the way it goes, I am glad i got it fixed. Now it is a Awesome Harp.  I will not compare the Hammond to the Manji, because they are both very nice, and both are great at what they do. But I will say that the Suzuki Hammond Harp is a fine Instrument, it has a Beautiful sound, and a very fine luxurious tone, I hope to be enjoying this for some time to come.

They are worth the money.

For $100 it's an OK starter guitar for a kid (and I guess really short people who can't play a regular Fender), but not something I'd recommend to anyone else.  And my kid thinks it looks cool, so he'll be more likely to stick with it.  Even though it has a laminated body, the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood.  The frets are crowned OK but have some sharp ends to them, and I feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed.  It's light and easy to handle.  The hardware isn't bad, with a stable bridge (good idea not to put a floating trem in this), 5-way blade switch, solid jack and strap anchors, and smooth knobs.  The pickups are not top notch but work well enough (a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does, so I'm not complaining).  It has a nice red paint job.  On the down side, besides some sharp fret ends, it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be.  The fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret.  The nut on the one I got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side, so the low E string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings.  It has one small pit in the red finish.  It has no paperwork or owner's manual.  The tuners are kind of choppy.  And the body/neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune.  It comes strung with Fender 9's, which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down, so it's good for a kid just starting out.  I actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound.

As of 12-2-13,the Boss SD-1 stands as the best overdrive pedal for my needs.  Notice that I didn't say ""for the money"".  No, that's just the icing on the cake. Here's what I've tried and/or owned:  BBE Green Screamer Boss BD-2 Boss OS-2 Digitech Bad Monkey Fulltone OCD Fulltone Fulldrive 2 Ibanez TS9 MXR Custom Bada$$ Modified OD Proco RAT2  I bought my SD-1 when I was a high school senior circa 1994.  Back then I had cheap guitars with crappy pickups and solid state amps that were thin, sterile, and lifeless.  I thought this pedal would help.  Well it didn't and was delegated to the closet where it sat for nearly 20 years until my desire to pick up the guitar took over.  Several years of my career(s), personal destruction and re-construction were pretty well settled, well partially at least, I got back on the crazy horse that calls itself a guitar hobby.  I tried all the above pedals and never really could settle on one.  It was always something.  Too harsh, too brittle, not enough sustain, too aggressive, etc.  Then I took the SD-1 for a ride again, this time with a Fender Blues Junior and a Tele with some real pickups in it. That's what was missing all along, tubes and good pickups.  This pedal does a great job tightening up the frequencies of the guitar and making your notes sing.  Yes it rolls off highs and lows but that's the designs' intent.  It makes dynamic amps like Fenders and Voxes sing while tightening up the response sort of like a compressor.  What about the beloved tube screamer?  I tried it along with several variations like the Bad Monkey and while those pedals are awesome in their own regard I find a certain magic in this little yellow box.  The notes sparkle better when you pick soft and grind harder when you give them a good whack.  Under the hood it's essentially a Tube Screamer that's been hot-rodded.  We'll see what else pops up down the road but this is a great pedal, period.

I don't know of another wax that does NOT contain silicone. Even Meguiars has it. That may be fine for automobiles, but when used on guitars, the silicone works it's way into the wood, and is impossible to remove. Later, if the guitar needs glue (repair), or a refinish, forget about it. Glues and coatings won't adhere properly.  I believe the reason everyone else uses silicone is to avoid caking in the container. It's more workable. Yes, Gerlitz does cake up, and it can be annoying, but it's not a big deal, especially considering the alternative.  I use it sparingly on my non-relic, non-vintage guitars.

They sound fantastic with the POD X3L, having just enough punch to be loud without shaking the walls or distorting the speakers. Jamming with backing tracks has never been so much fun.

If you're going to play guitar and you aren't rich enough to hire a guitar tech, you need to learn to set up your own instruments.  Most shops charge around $70 to $100 for a ""professional setup"" and it's REALLY easy to do if you have the right tools.  This becomes even more important as you collect more guitars.  I have 7 guitars and couldn't imagine paying over $1000 per year just on setups (I do a full setup on each of mine twice a year and do tweaks in between as needed.)  For years, I used the method of putting the capo on the first fret, and using the string as a straight-edge by pressing down on the last fret, then using feeler-gauges to measure the relief.  This tool makes it so much simpler and faster... just put it on the fretboard and you can measure the relief directly.  I've gotten to where I don't even need the feeler gauges anymore.  You can see the relief so clearly that you can just eyeball it once you do it a few times (I do check with a gauge every now and then to ""re-calibrate"" my eyes.)  I love that you're measuring the actual fretboard instead of the frets themselves, especially on guitars with worn frets.  It's also nice that it has two scale sizes, so it will work with most electric guitars (Les Pauls on one side, Stratocasters on the other)  The only possible gripe about this is that you could maybe scratch your instrument if you're not careful.  The edges and corners are a bit sharp.  I'm not one to baby my guitars though... if they get dinged and scratched, I don't care at all so long as they still play right.  That said, I've never scratched one with this tool, but I could see it happening if you're clumsy.",A must-have for guitarists.

It gets REALLY dry here when it gets cold, though, because the central heat is running, and it's so cold that you can't humidify rooms or the house.  In that case, I usually put a Kyser humidifier in the soundhole (keeps humidity in the guitar) and then put the Oasis inside the case for the case itself and the neck/fretboard (and usually stick a Herco in the case compartment as well!).  If it's not so dry where you live, you'll be fine just with this.  A few caveats.  If you let this humidifier get REALLY dry, it can rip the fabric.  It can also mold.  You're supposed to empty out the crystals at the end of every heating season and refill them at the beginning.  I don't think this is necessary.  I think it's better to just open it before it's totally dry, let some air in and let some space fill up the vacuum inside.  This will keep it from molding or tearing, and if you monitor it, you can let it safely dry completely and reuse it again.  ALWAYS use distilled water.  Keeps it from molding or collecting minerals.

The neck on the guitar is a bolt-on with a 7.25 inch radius. The good news is the bridge's post spacing matched the post holes on the guitar. The not so good news is the post anchors are smaller in diameter which means you need to shim the existing holes so these anchors fit snugly (or wrap them in tape). The really bad news is the saddle's string spacing resulted in the strings shifting to the left (looking down the neck from the tailpiece to the nut) with no way to make an adjustment. I'm sure the bridge will work fine as a replacement on a Fender type of guitar but as a solution for a Les Paul style with 7.25 of 9.5 inch radius it did not work for me.

2604,76532,5,True,"03 30, 2011",A3N2QDTY3VLUJK,B000RVYV20,Supperconductor,"I have a 1989 Fender Stratocaster Plus. It came from the factory with a trio of Fender Lace Gold Sensor pickups. While I liked the fundamental tone and voice of these stock Lace units, they were incredibly noisy. I know single coil pickups are normally not as quiet as hum-buckers but the sizzle, hiss, and spit I was getting was unbearable. I got headaches while practicing to the point I just stopped playing this guitar. I researched on how to fix this issue. I found some internet resources that advised adding metal foil shielding inside the guitar. When I opened my Strat up, I discovered a lot of shielding had already been applied at the factory. In addition, everything was also properly grounded. But, there was still too much pickup noise.  So I was intrigued at this set from EMG that promised good tone and low noise. They come pre-wired and ready to drop in with zero soldering required. The installation how-to video on EMG's site ([...]) was especially helpful. I am extremely pleased with the results. The EMGs are REALLY quiet and have a wonderful tone. OK, I don't sound like David Gilmour but it's going to take more than a pickup upgrade to make that happen. While practicing last night, even my wife commented ""Wow, that guitar sure does sound nice."" That's something I never thought I'd hear anyone say about my Strat.  Pros === QUIET - This was my number one requirement and it has been met. Excellent Tone. Evaluated with Peavey Classic 50 head amp and Peavey Classic 410E 4x10 open back cabinet. (FYI, this is incredibly subjective. Don't assume you'll like the tone and voice just because I did. You really have to try them in your guitar, your amp, while you are playing. This is obvious to most of you but I get a lot friends who ask for blanket recommendations and IMHO, tone is too subjective and too dependent on associated gear). Very easy installation - you'll need a phillips screwdriver and wire cutters. Attractive pick guard (I've read a lot of reviews call it ugly so YMMV)  Cons === Expensive - One could easily make the argument that it might be wiser to sell a guitar you don't like playing and buy another rather than dropping this much cash on an upgrade.

I run six pedals with a total max draw of 454 mA. The largest portion of that consumption belongs to my TC Electronic Nova Repeater @ 300 mA. In my old pedal board configuration, I ran all of the pedals off of a Visual Sound OneSpot, using the board's internal distribution and jumpers to supply all of the pedals. Never had a problem. The new board is a piece of plywood and doesn't have internal distribution capability so I thought it would be good to get a power supply that wouldn't require daisy chaining. The reviews for this product were quite good, especially for the price, so I bought it and installed it on my new pedal board. During rehearsal last night, the rig got it's first shakedown. The power supply worked on all of my pedals but one - the aforementioned Nova Repeater. When plugged into the Moozikpro Mini Power Supply, the LED of whatever channel I plugged it into immediately dimmed and the pedal powered off. I tried several different channels and jumpers, but all had the same result - it couldn't power my chorus. I fortunately had another power supply with me and ran it to the pedal and had no additional problems. If the channels on this power supply are truly isolated, then there should be specs as to what current and voltage draw each individual channel is capable of. I could find no such specifications. Had I seen them in advance, I might have made a different choice based on my pedal complement. The weight of the reviews for this product suggest that it works for many, but it didn't work for me.

Cost aside (what other manufacturer puts out a six-piece set with THREE cymbals that can be had for $850 or even less?), the quality of sounds is very good in my opinion and there are lots of them.  I appreciate that all the drum pads have two zones, not just the snare.  The rack, although it's lighter-gauge than what you would expect to find on an acoustic kit, is more than adequate.  Actually, it's pretty much rock-steady, and I love the fact that it doesn't take up too much real-estate in my studio.  The feel of the heads is great, and I really don't think the sound of sticks hitting the heads is loud at all as some other reviewers have opined.  Although they are ""real"" heads the pads have no shell depth for the sound to resonate and they are thickly dampened so stick noise was much less than I expected it to be.  Maybe Alesis has improved that aspect lately?  Yes, it's a pain in the neck to set all the pad and cymbal parameters so they are responsive enough and yet don't unintentionally trigger other components, but you only have to do it once and then you're all set (as long as you remember to save the settings before powering down!)  Yes, maybe Alesis could have shipped the brains with pre-set parameters that are closer to what actually works right out of the box, but then I think of all the money I saved by buying Alesis instead of other comparable kits and realize that the set-up was time well-spent.  A couple things I would suggest improvement for is the ride's bell and edge zones.  The bell is just a switch trigger, not a piezo, so no matter how hard you hit it it's the same volume. A piezo trigger would be much better. And the edge trigger is not customizable (at least, I haven't been able to figure out how to customize it): it triggers only when you hit the ride really hard (there doesn't seem to be a way to set the threshold), so you can't get a nice soft ride edge sound.  Finally, the high-hat isn't quite realistic in some respects.  With an acoustic high-hat for example, you can hit it while open then slowly close it and you get a nice sizzle as the top and bottom gradually come together.  You can't really duplicate this with the digital high hat, but it would be nice if you could.

2665,80768,5,False,"09 15, 2008",A1RXT6MNBFMTH3,B000WA4B1W,Louis S. Carrozzi,"Reason Version 4.0 - Mac - Review 9-15-2008  In order to give a meaningful review of Reason 4.0 and the major improvements in this latest version of Propellerheads' music creation software package, I first need to state exactly what Reason is, and what it is not.  The most descriptive definition of Reason is that it is basically a ""virtual rack mount studio"", complete with a built in sequencer, faithfully simulated in a single software package.  For those who are familiar with rack mount studio units, Reason incorporates most (if not all) common hardware rack mount units you would find in a typical recording studio. This includes mixer boards, effects processors (such as reverb, distortion, chorus and flanger units, etc.), two very robust digital samplers which can use samples and wave files as instrumental components, a drum sequencer, a drum sequence sampler/playback tool, and several analog synthesizer units as well - and much, much more.  Each of these devices can be ""cable patched"" into one another within Reason in almost any conceivable combination, and all of the units look and act like their hardware counterparts would in an actual recording studio.  Also, you can ""create"" as many of these virtual hardware components as you need and the only limitation you have on how many you can effectively use is limited only by your computer's processor speed, RAM, and the sound card hardware in your computer.  Since Reason 4.0 uses software to simulate the functions of these virtual hardware units, having a high-end soundcard is NOT necessary to get the most out of the Reason package.  Any decent PC or Mac sound card or chip is capable of getting near perfect sound quality out of this package - even the basic sound hardware found in a standard off the shelf Mac laptop such as the MacBook Pro will do just fine.  As a digital music creation platform, Reason has been very good for years, with one noticeable feature missing:  The ability to record ""live"" instruments, such as guitars or vocals.  While this lack of live recording ability has always made Reason a questionably ""complete"" DAW  (Digital Audio Workstation) software package, what it lacks in recording capability it more than makes up for by what it does best:  Be a one-man-band/studio in a single box.  For those who are already using another software package such as CakeWalk Sonar Studio for live recording, Reason does have the ability to be ""rewired"" into other packages that support rewiring, such as Sonar.  As an add-on component to other DAW software packages, Reason adds a some huge capabilities to other programs and can more than stand on it's own for creation of any conceivable type of electronic music from hip hop to classical to jazz and far beyond.  If you are looking to do a lot of live instrument recording, you might want to look at another software package, but if you are doing something ""instrumental"", say composing a music piece for a television commercial, look no further.  Reason has you covered - in a very big way.  This basic description of Reason as a ""one stop recording studio"" was accurate for version 2.5.  While Reason Version 2.5 was very robust, there were several features that were noticeably missing:  - The ability to easily combine samplers or synths into ""layered"" instruments (more than one type of sound being controlled by a single sequencer track) - A coherent and robust piano roll / track view with typical visual components (e.g. as found in other DAW packages such as Sonar) - A mastering suite of tools for controlling final mix down of tracks into a final polished and well engineered song - The ability to change tempo within a music project by measure - A very robust and complex synthesizer capable of producing a huge range of different sounds  Starting with the last drawback first, Reason 2.5 and 3.0 contained 2 main synths:  The Subtractor Analog synth and the Malstrom Graintable synth.  Reason 4 also still contains these two instruments. While these two synths were plenty capable of producing a host of ""vintage"" style synths sounds, they lacked the kind of customization that can be found in other high-end digital music packages such as Apple's Logic audio software, making music such as ""trance"" or ""techno-electronica"" style music incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to do in Reason.  This has now changed in a radical way for the better.  More on that in a minute...  Reason 3.0 was a huge step in the right direction for Reason users.  There were two major advances in Reason 3.0:  - The addition of a FULL suite of recording and mastering tools including a parametric EQ unit and a compressor unit, (among others).  The mastering suite units were a huge leap forward for Reason because they allowed composers to control exactly how a finished song should sound - and even how individual instruments within the song should sound - and these units also greatly reduced the occurrences of audio-clipping which can ruin a digital recording.  As with all other Reason ""hardware units"" the user has the ability to create and use as many mastering units as needed for any given project, limited only by processor speed and the amount of RAM in the user's computer.  - The addition of a new rack unit called the ""Combinator"".  The Combinator was another giant improvement on the Reason package because it allowed users to ""group"" any other kinds of Reason units into 1 ""package"" or ""group"" and then assign the entire group to a single sequencer track.  This meant that a user could now throw a mixer, some effects units, and several instruments into 1 package and treat the entire package as a single instrument from within the sequencer.  Obviously, this stretched Reason's sound producing capabilities much further and allowed the user to create multi-layered polyphonic instruments with ease.  Reason 3.0 was a great leap forward, for sure, but there were still the problems of having a somewhat limited synthesizer capability (there were still only the 2 synth units, and Reason was still fairly limited in that respect), you still couldn't change tempos mid song (you were pretty much stuck with one time signature per song) and the sequencer still had several problems that made it difficult, frustrating and often time consuming when working within the sequencer itself.  With respect to the sequencer issues, there were several other problems, but rather than go into all the details of what was still wrong with Reason 3.0, let's just get to the new version of Reason: Reason Version 4.0 and go over how any and ALL drawbacks of Reason 3.0 are now completely eliminated in Reason version 4.  Reason 4.0 is probably the first version of Reason that has finally eliminated any and all potential weaknesses with this software package, and Reason 4.0 is truly a devastating creative tool for musicians looking for full-featured music creation, recording and engineering package for less than a thousand bucks.  This is especially true if you are looking to do any kind of techno, trance, or industrial music as the new ""Thor"" polyphonic synthesizer utterly SLAYS anything previous versions of Reason had in terms of synthesis of sound or synchronized sequences of sound.  Probably the biggest instrumental leap forward for Reason 4.0 is the addition of the ""Thor"" Polyphonic Analog Synthesizer as a new instrument found only in Reason version 4.0.  The Thor synth is an amazing piece of ""virtual hardware"" that allows the user to create literally thousands (if not millions) of possible combinations of sound generators, oscillators, filters, envelope controls, and even automated or hardware controlled sound parameters, which can handle almost any aspect of sound generation.  While Reason 4.0 ships with a fairly decent amount of Thor ""instruments presets"" pre-created, these prefabricated presets really only scratch the surface of what Thor is truly capable of.  When the sequencing hardware found within Thor is combined with various parameters of the Thor sound generators and controllers, Thor completely blows away any kind of synth found in previous versions of Reason, and now the Reason software package has the capability of producing the deep and complex types of sounds and sequence loops that are often only found in hardware synths costing nearly two thousand dollars or more. The sequencing generator in Thor can be used to create delays, arpeggios, small instrumental sub-sequences and all other manner of complex sound effects found in a lot of high-end keyboard synths, and this places Reason 4.0's synth sound generation and control squarely in Apple's ""Logic"" audio software territory as well as now putting Reason 4.0 on the same turf as higher end Korg and Roland keyboard workstations.  By using Thor in combination with Reason's Combinator and the already built-in digital samplers, the sky is no longer the limit for sound creation in Reason.  The Thor Polyphonic Synth is a HUGE addition to Reason version 4.0 and alone is well worth the price of admission by itself, but Reason version 4.0 doesn't stop there.  The second, and another very significant upgrade to Reason version 4.0 is that all of the previous drawbacks of the Reason 2.5/3.0 sequencer have been completely eliminated in version 4.0.  Like previous versions of Reason, you can color-code your track labels with a right click on the track header. You can now toggle between track view and sequence piano roll view with a single mouse click; each of the tracks can now be viewed with the sequence elements (such as note placement in the piano roll now visible in track view as well) as well as effects controllers and note properties fully visible with a mouse click or two.  If you are a person who uses the visual cues of your sequence elements to keep track of what is what in your song, Reason 4.0's sequencer is now on par with the robustness of other software packages such as Sonar Studio.  Also, you can now actually see the instrument (or Combinator unit) as a visual element of the left hand side of track view very clearly, and each track is now expandable individually, or as a whole.  Also, all of your automation tracks are now controlled by ""automation lanes"" contained inside the track header for quick and easy navigation of automation channels within each track.  Just these changes alone make working with Reason's sequencer fun, easy and very intuitive, and all of the sequencer controls now make sense from an ease of use and robustness standpoint.  You want to open up a sequence segment in piano roll?  Simply double click the sequence and Reason takes you right into piano roll, and places you exactly within the right measures - Reason even color codes and highlights the appropriate measures in question so no more hunting around for ""those particular measures"" you want to edit.  There is also one other consideration here:  You can now toggle piano roll in your main reason rack-mount view window - easily.  This is a huge feature enhancement for Reason 4.0 because now you can test your patch creations within the main rack mount window simply by playing the keys in Reason's piano roll, and you can switch between track and your Reason hardware units with a couple of mouse clicks without ever having to leave the main Reason window.  This almost totally eliminates the need to hook up an external MIDI controller keyboard to test out your new sound creations.  Of course, Reason has always included MIDI-capable hardware control via an external controller such as a MIDI keyboard, but now you don't need one to edit your sounds quickly and efficiently.  Another welcome addition to the Reason 4.0 suite of components is the brand new RPG-8 Arpeggiator which allows you to create custom arpeggios that can control various aspects of other Reason instruments.  This is another great tool for people looking to create techno-trance music or musical effects for instruments, and again extends Reason 4.0's capabilities further.  Having said all this, I haven't even touched on Reason 4.0's continuation of previous strengths such as the built in vo-coder, the robustness and flexibility of the NN-XT built in digital sampler unit, the Dr. Rex drum sequencer, the myriad of effects processors and the incredibly intuitive and visual design of the virtual hardware units in Reason.  What Reason has done extremely well with previous versions is now a whole lot better in version 4.0 while still retaining all of the elements that made previous versions of Reason great.  At $400, Reason 4.0 is an absolutely incredible value - being basically an entire recording studio in one box - and its previous weaknesses have been seen, faced, and dismissed outright.  If Reason 4.0 supported live recording and VSTi compatibility, it would basically do anything and everything you could possibly want, no matter what type of music you are looking to create.  Even with these two features missing, $400 is still a ""steal deal"" for this software package.  For $400 bucks you basically get a $2,000+ keyboard, oh, and that keyboard also happens to come with a complete recording studio.  Try and beat that, for the price?  You can't.  If all of this still isn't enough for you to get the job done, it is worth mentioning that there are literally hundreds of free downloads that you can get off the internet to ""plug in"" new pre-created instruments into Reason's various components and there are many commercial packages - both from Propellerheads and other companies - that can add whole new dimensions to Reason's sound capabilities that go far beyond the basic package you get from Reason ""straight out of the box"".  Not to mention the fact that Propellerheads also have several other software packages that expand Reason's capabilities even further - not that you would need any of them if you learn how to use Reason itself, but even a great program can get even better with add-ons.  If you are a beginner just getting into the hobby of digital music creation and recording on your PC or Mac, Reason 4.0's intuitive and visual interface can get you into music creation easily, and is a worthy product just based on that.  However, even a seasoned professional will find Reason to be a hugely flexible, robust and powerful application for professional quality sequencing, recording and engineering.  And, while Reason may not be able to record vocals or live instruments on its own, Reason's powerful re-wire capabilities and sampling units can easily integrate Reason's powerful features with your existing DAW software.  For example, you can create your instrumental tracks in Reason, then simply export the loop you created (or even the entire song) as a *.wav or *.aiff file for use in another application.  Conversely, you can record your ""live music"" audio files in another application, export them as *.wav files, then import them into Reason's NN-19 or NN-XT digital samplers and then engineer and mix down your entire song in Reason alone.  Bam!  Done.  When you are done with all of your hard work, you can export your entire song straight to a *.wav or *.aif file and go from there.  Sadly, Reason 4.0 still doesn't have a direct song to *.mp3 encoder, but that's not really a big deal since most computers these days have some easy (and often free) way to convert *.wav or *.aif files to *.mp3 format or to CD audio tracks.  Mac OS X, for example has a free *.mp3 converter as a feature of ITunes.  All of that aside, Reason 4.0 is still an awesome program and a significant upgrade from version 3.0, and Reason 4.0 probably gives you more bang for your buck than any other digital audio workstation package out there (minus the live recording and VSTi compatibility issues).  Reason is an amazingly powerful, robust, flexible and comprehensive music-making package worthy of addition to any home/PC-based recording studio.  The bottom line?  Believe the hype.  Buy it, and try it, learn it, love it.  Reason 4.0 aims to please, and you won't be disappointed.  One final note:  If the geniuses at Propellerheads give Reason 5.0 the power to include live instrument recording and native support for audio tracks it might be ""game-over"" for the competition.

However, I'm blown away by the sound coming from this little puppy.  First, it reproduces my MP3 tunes very well, with better-than-expected bass response for small speakers.  The line-in signal is not routed through the amp's volume or tone controls, so I have to use the MP3 player to control loudness, but that's no big deal.  I tried my acoustic guitar with this amp.  The sound is crisp and clean.  The chorus effect is very good, but mix level cannot be adjusted.  I also like the reverb and delay effects blended with the chorus.  The sound is very lush, comparable to my TC Electronics pedals.  Next, I tried my Tele with the Cube.  The clean sound - with and without chorus/reverb - is excellent.  I like the slight edge the overdrive setting produces.  I can't say I'm thrilled with the distortion setting, but I've never been a fan of analog distortion to begin with - I can't blame that on the Roland.  Finally, keep in mind that this is a practice amp.  Reviewers who are critical of the unit's overall volume probably had unrealistic expectations.  If I want volume, I'll use my Marshall.

I decided to switch out the pickups for Seymour Duncans - boom! Magic! I think switched out the wire - boom! More magic! Then, I decided I wanted a vibrato (aka tremolo) system on my guitar, so I got the Stetsbar bridge and was happy; it even held tune okay. However, I decided I wanted to get tuners that would REALLY hold it in tune, and I was intrigued by the Planet Waves Auto Trim locking tuners. Big mistake.  I know that no hardware is going to be absolutely, 100% perfect, so bear in mind that I'm comparing these tuners to the stock Grover tuners my Epiphone came with.  Two main problems with the Planet Waves tuners:  #1. Strings are breaking all the time! I never had this problem before, even when I installed the whammy system. I'm finding myself going through a different high E string every day - and I play in flat tuning, so it should be reduced string tension. The B string is also a common casualty.  #2. These tuners can't hold tune. The problem is most noticeable on low E, but is also an issue everywhere else. If I start a song perfectly in tune after using a chromatic tuner, I find three minutes later that power chords sound awful because low E is flat. I've tried tightening the gears - I've even used a wrench - but there's nothing I can do to prevent slipping.  I get the impression that these tuners were designed specifically for standard and heavy strings. I like light strings, though, and it looks like these tuners simply can't handles 8s and 9s the way they should.  Again, I know all tuners will eventually slip a little and you need to retune from time to time. With the stock Grover tuners that my Epiphone came with, though, I was only having to tune my guitar once or twice a week. After two months, I just gave up and replaced the Planet Waves tuners with the old Grover ones.",I used these for two months and then gave up.,1345852800,3.0,{'Color:': ' Gold'},,know mistake look hold vibrato tune power paul magic prevent find i've wave epiphone way like come however pickups simply week need noticeable perfect think one hold specifically problem can't get nothing high everywhere compare le eventually big problem different later minute impression duncan want song tune happy aka retune boom little stetsbar really seymour slip play break like casualty issue reduce string let low go twice perfectly use first sounded lock light tuner muddy tuner month decide time switch find mind get common would auto standard give trim also whammy intrigue bear chromatic even explain start else day guitar sound tightening chord bridge main never design switch i'm stock gear two planet old okay come grover tension system try wrench slip though replace there's wire instal flat handle tremolo heavy use hardware three awful every absolutely string

I can't stress this enough. I've been in countless recording studios in my day and receiving mics that only attach via 3.5mm is SUPER annoying! Granted, this mic isn't exactly made for ""radio"" airplay, but that's not the point. With the current progress in today's electronics, is nice to be able to plug an actual mic cable into a mic. It feels more like a tool and less like a toy. The stand is very sturdy and includes the perfect holder to grab the mic. It also comes with an adapter so you can screw the holder to other style mic stands as well. Nice little addition, if you ask me?!  For the price, the sound quality can't be beat! There's nothing worse when voice recording than getting a crappy sound. This mic lets the sound come out clean and clear! At least, if you're using the correct equipment. The plugs allow for both connection type. The standard XLR (mic) connection, and your 3.5mm ""headphone"" jack. The included USB allows for the powering of the mic when using the 3.5mm connection. Also, the inclusion of two (2) separate knobs allow you to adjust sound on the fly. The volume knob is nice (but not completely necessary), and the echo knob is apt to cause more problems than not. If you think that kid's voice is annoying BEFORE, wait til they crank the echo all the way up! Of course, neither is mandatory to use the mic.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with this product.

I have played everything from EVH to Ernie Ball, SIT, DR Blues, and everything in between.  I had high hopes for these strings because I had heard their praises sung in many guitar podcasts from pro guitar players.  And the description and packaging says ""NYXL guitar strings will bend farther, sing louder, and stay in tune better than any string youve played before"".  It also said ""reformulated nickel plated string windings have greater magnetic properties resulting in higher output and enhanced mid-range frequency response for more presence and crunch"".  This was just not the case.  From a guitar player's perspective (I play mainly gibson humbucking guitars) the difference in sound was so dramatic switching from my EVH 9's to this set of NYXL extra lights that it was like I had swapped my pickups out for single coils.  I was like I turned a coil tap on.  It literally cut the volume output signal coming through my amp by about 35%.  So much so that I questioned if there was something wrong with either my guitar (which was brand new) or a cable connection.  I swapped another guitar back and forth just to make sure I wasn't crazy - because I have never heard strings adversely affect my sound in this way before.  The output was so screwed up that when I played lead with my boost pedal on it was like I wasn't even using it.  Swapping out for another guitar with my normal strings on it, worked fine.  Switch back to the one with these NY XL's and volume dropped again.  It was not that the sound from these strings was bad all around.  They did ring, it was clear, intonation was good, and they got in tune and stayed in tune pretty quick.  But the ""crunch"" and ""presence"" the package talked about never came.  I mean it was like someone swapped all my pedals out for ones that were half the power.  It was like my amp volume had been lowered.  For comparison purposes, I was playing a brand new 2017 Gibson Flying V with Dirty Fingers humbuckers through a PRS 25 watt Archon amp through multiple pedals (a Rat, a Tube Screamer, a Blackface drive, and a EHX Soul Food - all one at a time).  Also I play in a cover band that does all styles, so I also tried clean country sounds, 80's hair metal, classic rock, and everything in between.  I have never had a set of strings on my guitar for only 1 hour that I wanted to remove as badly as these.

This tube modeler acts first as a pre-amp, and then adds gain, volume control, ""crunch"", whatever, to the non-guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps. I don't really care what tube amps it models, or what mic placement, I just want the guitar amp sound and style. I also use it in front of a Behringer Ultra-G DI box, so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my non-guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage, and the other half to the house PA. I don't think that many people would do this. The sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp, and kind of amp you are driving with it, and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving. The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound, but I've used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps, home stereo amps, bass amps, and guitar amps, all of which drove PA speakers, bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers, all in the same acoustic space. Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant, sound different: some more like guitar  amps and speakers, some not. As I said, I don't really care about what tube amp is being modeled, only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box. It works for me. I read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2, and based on its performance so far, it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do.

It does not do it. It only works as a single channel selector, because whatever instrument has the strongest signal overpowers the others so their signal doesn't get through. For instance, say I've got my guitar, keyboard, and mic plugged into the A, B, and C spots. My guitar sucks up all the signal, and you can't hear the keys or the mic. I have to turn off channel A, and then I can hear either the mic or the keys, depending on how I have their volumes set. So it's really only good for ONE channel at a time. If you have three instruments with equal signal output strength (good luck!) AND you want them to play through the amp at equal sound (which would be never!) THEN it combines.

One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals.  It's not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs $150, $200, $250, $350...whatever.  There are a LOT of really expensive distortion/OD pedals out there.  I've had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years, after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years.  I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals, just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix.  I generally use the Bad Monkey for mid-gain crunch tones, and for that it's just fantastic.  Having two tone controls makes all the difference.  This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque, but not as midrange-heavy as a TS.  Anyway, this thing sounds great.  Excellent classic rock and lead tones.  The things it WON'T do: 1) a clean boost.  It has plenty of output, but there's always a little bit of dirt in the signal, so it can't be used as a pure clean boost.  2)  it won't clean up when you turn your guitar down...or at least not much.  No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone.  I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifully.

But at ~$2.00 for a five-pack, I have zero complaints.  And they WILL work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. For size reference, see pic.

I'm taking advantage of Black Friday sales and already got a 15W Marshall and a Peavey Vypyr 1 is on the way; i can't wait!, but I know there will be an extreme learning curve just programming it. But THIS one is FUN! I love the retro look and style, even the knobs on top look retro. Great colors, great materials, great style all around. And the style wraps around the whole amp in every detail.  Now, if you're a ""serious"" guitarist who only likes Marshalls and is picky about having a ""good"" guitar made only by Fender/Squier or Gibson/Epiphone, you're not going to like this. I'll tell you the bad right up front:  the volume knob is more like an off/on switch, it doesn't have gradual fade-fade-in control at low-levels; it goes from being off to suddenly on when turning the volume knob slowly from 0 up, it doesn't matter how careful you are. I haven't tried adjusting my guitar knobs to see but they're set fine and low for my Marshall. To get ""overdrive/distortion"", even with your guitar knobs adjusted up, you have to turn the gain to 9 or 10 (and push the overdrive selector button in); it mostly sounds ""clear"" at any knob settings and any volume. If you crank the gain distortion is adequate, not great, but acceptable for the mid-high frets especially in chords, it still sounds clear at lower frets and most single notes.  On the good side, I was surprised at the volume of this amp right away;  I actually heard it kick in and turned my guitar down before beginning to play, and adjusted the amp volume to the lowest setting (there is no low). The pick-up sensitivity and power of it was immediate. It's actually smaller in size than my 15W Marshall, but cranks! Perfect for a beginner shredder or someone that just wants to have fun and always plays at full (pre-)gain like myself. I was surprised it wasn't bad for jazz to despite the distortion setting. I could switch from trying to crunch and shred to picking out full-sounding jazz notelines without changing any settings (I have the bass to 10 and treble and midrange on 0 normally). Again there's considerably more distortion in chords than notes, being an asset or a disadvantage depending on your taste. I like it. You're not going to take this amp to a gig. I have other practice amps, and this one just looks great and I don't care if I shred *it*. I can pretend it's the 50s or 60s (or ?) with my 60's-era retro guitars. If you play in a retro band you might put it on stage in front for show (but use something else).  Understanding what it is and what it's not (a performance amp), if you want it just because it looks cool, well, it does! :) I like it.",Just for Fun!,1447113600,,,,know surprise look shred away power black like go crunch i'll detail taste use gain performance button way like program fade-fade-in pick-up fender/squier overdrive/distortion depend glad amp practice could hear someone take fine actually shredder might perfect full-sounding beginner turn can't normally get want suddenly fret wait kick take curve sensitivity overdrive something careful great already mid-high serious note color considerably bass immediate learning amp adjust notelines size low vypyr play fun put stage knob one play push despite love pre-)gain tell turn distortion make slowly right guitarist whole selector low try pretend go sound good low-levels single set picky crank off/on peavey turn want full cool switch get especially gibson/epiphone sale disadvantage mostly top gradual bad adequate crank gig guitar material still small friday even see treble advantage marshall front matter midrange asset band pick else guitar buy chord volume side retro wrap begin i'm style around set try without look marshall there's acceptable setting knob jazz well always extreme adjust they're show every low clear change understand care control

When you step on the switch, it does not activate the pedal until you lift your foot off the switch. This is because of design. Since it is programmable, you can cycle trough the patches while holding down the foot switch. Therefore, It will not activate until you release the foot switch.  For example if you already have to patch you want selected, and the eq is bypassed or off, step on the switch and release to engage. You will not hear the effect until you lift your foot. If you leave your foot on the switch too long it will go to your next preset. Until you get use to the way it works you might experience a delay when switching, but by design it's a normal condition.  Aside from that it is very quiet, the presets save your settings including volume changes for each patch. I believe you an store up to 4 presets so you can use it for eq or boost whatever you want.

I own many guitars, electric and acoustic, including one 12 sting acoustic but no 12 string electric.  I wanted a 12 string Electric guitar to experiment with just to see if it would be something I would actually use.  I do own a Rickenbacker 6 string and considered buying the Ric 12 but asked about and a good friend of mine who is also a luthier recommended I give this Dean a try. I found a brand new one for an unbelievable low price so ordered it, a Trans Cherry Burst exactly like the one pictured here.  First, let me say the photo doesn't begin to do the guitar justice.  The paint is vibrant and the fit and finish is outstanding and flawless, better than you'd find on a guitar costing 5 times what this one sells for.  She is a bit neck heavy but there are 12 tuners so it has to be so I put a nice padded strap on and tuned it, then plugged it in......and WOW.  The sound brought me back to the early days of rock and roll.  NO feedback whatsoever, just pure 12 string harmony with a LOT of tone range from jangly to a deep throaty sound.  I am so impressed by this guitar and am 100% positive that I will play it often and it will be my go-to guitar for many songs that would benefit from that 12 string harmonic tone.  Another thing that surprised me was how well this thing stayed in tune, which is important when you're talking about 12 strings to adjust...  I could not be happier with my purchase.  I have NO plans on purchasing another 12 string, this one is perfect for what I need it for and I plan on using it well.  Sure, I love my Ric and would love to have a Ric 12 too but just can't see paying $2500+ for it when this $300 guitar sounds just as nice and looks as good too.  The ONLY reason I can see that anyone wouldn't buy this one opposed to a Ric would be for status.  I own too many Gibsons, American Fenders and other high end guitars to count but some of my favorites are the less expensive models, this being one of them.

I keep it on my acoustic but use it when I am tuning up my electric, too. I won't go into how great the device is; that's been said over and over and I have nothing to add except that I am totally lost without it. I had a recent mishap with my Snark and needed to replace the clip that broke, not due to a failure but due to a mishap on my end. For your background info, the Snark clip-on tuners have three parts: 1) The clip, 2) The stem/neck that has a ball on both ends and 3) the electronic head. Both the head and the clip have a ball hole for the ends of the neck to rest inside of. Anyway, I went to the Snark website and saw that if I had a warranty/repair issue I needed to email someone named ""Macy."" I sent this email to the noted address:  ""Hello! My Snark SN-1 clip-on tuner has a broken clip. The jaw of the bottom part of the clip broke (right at the first 't' on the word 'PATENT' and at the 'n' on the word 'PENDING' on the line below it). The stem that attaches to the electronic disk display is fine. I just want a new clip to pop the ball of the neck/stem into. I love my Snark and am lost without it. I'd be happy to just buy a new one, but that seems wasteful to me since mine still works fine. No need to fill up landfills. I'll pay reasonable fees for a replacement clip. Let me know the amount.""  I sent it at midnight CST and the following day around 11 a.m. CST, I got this reply:  ""Hi Brian No problem.  We'll send you a new Blue clip. no charge Thank you Marcy""  And with that, I'm a Snark customer for life. Items can and will fail due to use, abuse, failure or fate. What separates great companies from others is what they'll do about it to make it right. It doesn't get any more ""right"" than that.
