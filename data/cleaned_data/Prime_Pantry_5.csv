I was excited to try these heat therapy patches, and overall I'm happy with them. I like the way they are designed to sit around/over the neck and they do cover both sides and back of the neck area. It seemed to take quite some time for the pad to reach a good level of warmth, but that warmth did last for several hours. My biggest issue is that the pad only has sticky-tabs on the very ends of the wrap, and no adhesive in between or even at the centre point. As the pad sits curved around the neck, I assume it's believed this shape would help hold the pad in place. It does this to a point, but if you move around much, the pad can lift away slightly and I found this annoying.  It helped ease my neck tension & accompanying pain somewhat, and did target this tricky-to-heat area reasonably well. Not a bad price point when I purchased. I would buy again.",Not as hot as I'd like but worked quite well.,1493078400,,,,away move heat much ease quite somewhat way excited pad like hour level accompany wrap try warmth area hold last chronic several shape take curve slightly therapy arthritis pain happy around/over find seem adhesive help lot issue back annoy lift place point good side target price neck help time purchase condition would buy bad tricky-to-heat centre end even reasonably sit big neurologic reach design i'm around overall degenerative cover tension believe patch assume sits well sticky-tabs

Why?  -It does clean them well, without any need to brush -It does the work fast -It leaves a nice slick polished feel on the aligners, which helps them avoid gunk sticking before the next cleaning -I can use it each time I take the aligners out, more than once a day, and it doesn't dry out the aligners  One of the things I actually prefer about this compared to Retainer Brite is that these are always intact full tablets. The Retainer Brite seemed to have a lot of broken, powdered up tablets that were messy to get fully out of the foil paper tear away, even though I do like that product too.  Some more aggressive tablet cleaners like this seemed to ""dry out"" the clear aligner braces (ones that were agressive about listing OXY), but this one does not. Many clear braces are switched weekly, and in that case even the aggressive cleaners don't matter because the braces won't ""dry out"" before you switch to a new pair.

I do not think that a milk chocolate can ever really be a dark chocolate. What we have here, is a questionable marketing ploy to try to pass off a darker colored milk chocolate as a dark chocolate.

They don't carry it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  We've tried it both right out of the can and well-chilled, and neither one passes the muster. If you are old enough to remember Strawberry Nehi sodas, then you will be able to understand what I mean when I say that this stuff tastes like a glass of carbonated water with a few drips of Strawberry Nehi mixed in. There is zero dragonfruit taste, so I'd guess they tacked that on there to sound exotic and interesting. It is FAR from interesting. There's a little bit of the strawberry soda aftertaste, but that's all.  I would definitely NOT buy it again.  I'll stick with other brands of sparkling water that have actual taste to them.

It is delicious, and the addition of the peanut butter drizzle on top of each bar is genius. Most of us fell in love with Nature Valley with the original granola bars, and I took that bar and ran with it, pairing it with all sorts of toppings (various nut butters, yogurt, Greek yogurt, frozen yogurt, in my cereal, crumbled on top of brownies - anything!). And I'm not fooling myself to think that just because the package says ""granola"" or that it touts to provide ""1/3 of your daily whole grains"" that these bars are the healthiest snack out there. All I know is that compared to other snacks in the same category, these bars beat out any other snack/health bar in terms of sugar/calories/bad fats, and these bars taste a whole lot better than the rest. And as a bonus, you get two! So if you're going to snack, you might as well eat something that tastes delicious, provides you with some amount of nutrients, and resembles actual food.  Some stats about the package: - It arrived a little man-handled. The box was dented in a few places, so if I were at a grocery store, I'd probably buy the box behind this one. - The first package of bars I opened were cracked in half.

It's more refreshing, and leaves me energized. Plus, I've lost weight and I get some extra vitamins to boot. It's a win-win.  Typically I always buy the non-carbonated version. I have now tried three varieties of the carbonated V8 Energy, and I have to say that the orange pineapple is my favorite of the lot.  Much like the carbonated grape and cranberry flavors I have tried, this drink always reminds me of the bottler sparkling grape juice we toast as a family on New Year's Eve. It definitely has that tart, crisp flavor. This one, however, is pleasantly citrusy, which makes for a nice change. It reminds me a little bit of the flavored sparkling waters (Clearly Canadian, Quest, etc.) that were popular in the early 1990s. I just liked this flavor the best.  That said, I still prefer the non-carbonated version, but take your early the strawberry lemonade flavor. But if you simply prefer carbonation, or if it's easier to switch from soda to a carbonated juice drink, this is a great way to go. Like the regular juice version, this is powered by natural caffeine from green tea and it's low on the sugar (10 grams for the whole can, about 1/4 the amount in a soda can).

1010,33324,4,False,"03 31, 2010",A2M4U0ZK4R3ZXW,B00IB0CO1O,R. Morris,"First off, I have no real complaints about these wipes: they do a good job cleaning and they stay moist for fairly long. However, perhaps a tradeoff for how long they stay moist is that they seem a little soapy (the cloths themselves are actually very wet), and they tend to leave a bubbly trail wherever I use them. Despite this, it doesn't leave a residue or anything, but it is a bit unusual.  Do note the directions, which are typical for all such cleaners/disinfectants: to clean, just wipe the surface down as you wish; to disinfect, wipe the surface down so it stays wet for 10 minutes, then allow it to dry naturally. Rinse direct food contact surfaces with water--I actually do this with almost all of my surfaces in the kitchen, even though they aren't all food contact surfaces. (Again, this is standard procedure for most products.)  I find the rinsing also lessens the smell, which some people may find disagreeble. Personally, I don't mind it, but you might want to smell these in a store or buy a smaller container first before committing youself to a larger volume. The scent, lemongrass and thyme, isn't really intentional: it's a result of the cleaning product itself.

Cost is similar, both cartons contain ten taco shells and use the exact same ingredients (limed corn, flour, palm oil and salt). But, there is a difference in weight.  A box of the SS shells weighs 6.6 ounces while SNS weighs 4.7 ounces so SS provides a larger total serving. And, the calories reflect that increase in size. SS has 170 calories per two shell serving and SNS has 130, with the rest of the nutritional numbers increased proportionately.  Specifics to size, SS is one inch longer and 1/2 inch narrower than SNS. I find it easy to fill the SNS since they stand unassisted, but they are also more difficult to eat. A single bite often causes the bottom to completely crack apart with the contents falling down to the plate.

1378,59529,5,True,"09 30, 2015",A3KGVEYJIYPLB,B00R1H0EEW,PPantryReviews,"Can there be any better combination than sweet and salty?  These bars are phenomenal, but don't be fooled - they are not necessarily ""healthy""! They are delicious, and nutty, and sweet, and compared to other bars out there, they are a little bit better for you. To compare, let's take another nut ""candy"" bar, like Payday. The center of this bar is some form of caramel, but it has a large amount of peanuts, so that's why I chose it for comparison. I've used a third party website to calculate what 1 Payday bar (52 grams) would be in terms of calories/fat/sugar/fiber compared to 1 bar (35 grams) of Nature Valley Peanut Granola Bar: - 52 grams/1 bar of Payday candy bar: 240 calories, 13 grams fat, 21 grams sugar, 2 grams fiber - 35 grams/1 bar of Nature Valley Peanut Granola Bar: 170 calories, 8 grams fat, 7 grams sugar, 1 gram fiber  So the Nature Valley bar is nearly the same as the traditional ""candy"" bar...but just a tad bit better in terms of sugar content. The ingredient list on the Nature Valley bar is shorter, which makes me feel like there are fewer fake ingredients or unnecessary ingredients.

I got a small package of these as an add-on to a larger order, planning to cut them into small pieces as a try-out.  TinkerToy has learned he must sit calmly before he gets a treat, but after the first bite, his manners were [temporarily] out the window.  There are only a few other treats for which I can say the same (even little bits of roast beef, btw).  They are a larger treat than I normally give my little guy - not that he couldn't manage the size, simply that I don't want to over-treat a ten pound dog - but they are softish & flexible enough to cut easily with scissors. I quickly cut them into small strips which I store in a sealed container to keep them fresh.  Tink's tail wags furiously the moment I open the lid - so I will no doubt be purchasing these repeatedly.  Made in the USA and grain-free - and sized so that they would be suitable for larger dogs as well - either whole or cut in half.  Although these are new for us, I rotate treats, and always pay careful attention to Tinker's reaction to any addition to his diet. I don't anticipate a problem, but will return to update if anything changes.

The 220 calorie serving size is 2/3 cup which is larger than many granolas, often only 1/4 to 1/2 cup, because of the density of the components. The difference is the inclusion of rice in this variety which permits a larger size bowl without greatly increasing the calorie count. The cereal is still hearty.  The sugar is a little high at 15 grams and so is sodium at 130 mg, but granola can be high in fat but is reasonably low here, at 4 grams (1 gram saturated).

My go to mascara's are Lancme Definicils and Younique 3D but, I recently tried a very cheap Elf mascara because the price was great and I was completely impressed so I thought maybe drugstore mascaras had improved.  After all, I've been using Lancme for over 10 years and makeup has come a long way.  So, I got this, also at a great price, with high hopes.  Turns out it was a complete waste of money...I'm just glad it wasn't much.  The applicator is really big, almost oversized but has short, sparse, hard little bristles that offer no chance for creating volume.  The wand picks up way more mascara than the brush and is hard to use without making a mess.  The mascara goes on clumpy and actually, unbelievably,  makes my lashes look thinner.  It doesn't harden well.  The color is awful.  It's supposed to be black/brown which, in my experience is usually pretty dark.  This is brown, not dark at all.  The one positive thing I can say about this is that it is indeed waterproof...took forever to remove.  I totally understand now why Amazon was offering a $3.00 coupon and $5.93 mascara.  Unfortunately, it's not worth the difference.  If you want a decent cheap volumizing mascara, try the e.l.f. Volume Plumping mascara.

I'm not going to focus on nutritional details since that's readily available on the package. Instead I'm focusing solely on subjective experience, and since I ordered a wide variety of similar products I'm going to use a standard template because I'm lazy that way.  PREPARATION: Heating time was accurate; one minute in a 900w microwave oven on a rotating plate perfectly heated the entree.  OBSERVATIONS: Unlike other entrees I've been eating, this one has a slightly different presentation. Rather than mixing the sauce directly with the pasta, this one has a separate little cup of sauce on the side. After microwaving you pour the sauce onto your pasta, toss the little cup away, mix, and eat. While this may be a bit more wasteful, it does allow Barilla to do something that other pasta entrees are unable to do: serve al dente pasta. Since the pasta isn't sitting in a pool of sauce for an indefinite period of time, the pasta doesn't get that characteristic mushiness that precooked pasta is known for. As a result this pasta is significantly more firm than any other (non-Barilla) entree, and I wholeheartedly approve of this method. The sauce had a good flavor and was perfectly in proportion to the amount of pasta given. The meat was disappointly sparse, however; I would have liked to have more than maybe the teaspoon that was in what is supposed to be a MEAT sauce.  VERDICT: Near the top of my reordering list.","A little stingy on the meat, but otherwise an excellent dish.",1502928000,,,,product away sparse significantly directly teaspoon maybe i've think use onto amount way wide disappointly order however share near entree know wholeheartedly oven presentation mushiness entree nutritional template get pour allow i'd al non-barilla flavor something slightly different mixing precook unlike microwave eat little solely dente that's one pasta like part dietary package barilla meat approve similar separate reordering go good readily subjective perfectly sit accurate list bit indefinite minute variety proportion eat time result characteristic focus compete would cup heat method verdict top standard rotate wasteful supposed firm period plan mix meal side experience unable microwave pool i'm serve sauce since instead lazy detail toss heat available observation plate focus preparation may give rather

The scent is strong so you don't need much. It don't really know what to compare the smell to, other than it smells like a feminine perfume... floral but with a bright citrus note too. On clothing, it's very mild, but if you are washing a picky male's laundry you might want to try something more herbal. My husband doesn't care one way or the other so this is fine for us.  I know fabric softeners/scent boosters/added stuff are not that great for fabrics but I like my laundry to smell clean. I respond to scent and I have found that I enjoy doing laundry much more if I have nicely scented things to use.  I was using Purex Crystals but the packaging is deceptive, it's only about 3/4 of the way full. I also have to use more in order to get the benefit of the scent. The Downy packaging is a bit better and I do the tiniest sprinkle. One bottle lasts a long time.  They open easily (I guess so people can try the scent before purchasing) and people can steal right from the bottle. I have found half-empty bottles on the shelf before. A friend of mine works in a department store and she says people will dump the entire contents into a ziploc bag and walk out with it! So be sure to check your bottles when you make a purchase! It's easy to just grab a bottle thinking it's full and get home to find that some is missing, especially if you're a distracted mom and are in a hurry to get home before your child has an in-store meltdown!  I now make my own laundry detergent and I use these in one of my batches (I make a softener/added stuff free batch too, for towels) and I am very happy with it. Only one step and no measuring when its time to wash. The recipe I use is from a blog called Aprons 'n Pearls and the post is called Homemade Laundry Soap (if you want to Google it, I found it on Pinterest). It uses washing soda, borax, Fels Naptha, and other ingredients plus these. You only need a couple-few tablespoons per laundry load so one batch lasts a looong time. It takes about 20-30 mins to make it.  I purchased this through Prime Pantry and it was $6.99 with a $2.00 coupon, which is still a little bit more than what I'd pay in my grocery store. But I needed a new bottle before I would have a chance to run to the store. I paid extra for the delivery but in store this is much less expensive, especially if you can find a coupon.",Gorgeous Scent,1421539200,4.0,,,know mild think half-empty batch perfumey steal meltdown much fabric chance use bright find packaging clothing scent enjoy wash way nicely like herbal order deceptive extra load smell couple-few scented pay softener/added need fine might bottle try guess expensive open walk naptha tiny soap get detergent grocery i'd barely something sure great apron looong hurry clean mine wash potent well happy long purchasing find less blog little purex thing really smell bag one miss love entire new need delivery right distract feminine compare perfume pantry free home picky child soda shelf respond laundry step post bit prime stuff tablespoon want fabric full crystal google time mom purchase especially purchase would male's friend check coupon content ziploc also batch min bottle dump trick recipe still work towel easy husband easily grab pinterest per softeners/scent make measure pearl plus say downy ingredient boosters/added last homemade fels department floral sprinkle borax run take call people pay use citrus strong note benefit use in-store store care

Considering that I do a lot of baking from scratch, I thought that was a pretty insulting remark but anyway here goes:  I normally don't make white cakes, because I hate separating eggs. This mix gives the option of using either 3 egg whites alone or 3 whole eggs, along with oil and water. I adjusted the mixture slightly---I used 4 whole eggs and a stick of melted butter instead of oil---and apparently that was the magic change that resulted in the most delicious cake of all time.

The cereal is not sugary sweet like a kids breakfast cereal. The hint of dark chocolate is in the center of each cereal bite. I like the taste but I notice the flavor of the cinnamon much more than the chocolate in the cereal. If I let the cereal soak in milk for a few minutes, the chocolate centers have a chance to mingle with the milk and flavor it similar to other chocolate based cereals. At that point, I do get more dark chocolate flavor in my cereal bowl as I eat it.  I generally eat non-sugared brand name cereals and granola. I like this cereal as it does have a nice flavor and it is different from many of the other brands that I eat regularly.
