Compared to those, they have some advantages and disadvantages. The advantages  1. They are easy to keep clean or even sterile (more or less) because you can wash them just like washing your hands. That is, leave them on and then wash your hands as usual. You can also toss them into the dishwasher or washing machine with your clothes. So using these for food prep is a more attractive alternative to the soon to be grungy quilt gloves.  2. They grip like crazy. Not only does this make for much safer handling of hot items, but put both on and then that jar of pickles, impossible to open with your bare hands is suddenly easy to open.  3. They seem to be quite tough resisting an abrasion which would wear an opening in a quilt mitt letting its stuffing out.  4. If they get wet, they don't soak the liquid up and you don't get wet unlike the quilt gloves which trap liquids inside of them and soak through easily. You can use these as heavy duty gloves for more than heat such as using them to protect your hands doing the dishes or other work like car washing.  The downsides are minor:  1. Their grippy nature causes you to take a bit more time getting them on or off.  2 The fit for my US size 9.5 or 10 hand was fine but those with very small hands will find them too large.

The ad, however, clearly states they are round top staples. That's why I bought them. The round top doesn't create a pressure point, when I install them as others have mentioned. In fact the lack of square corners makes them far more comfortable in my opinion... and stronger. The shipping is free. So the recent shipping complaints are clearly in places where shipping costs are expectedly high (islands, wildernesses, countries with poor infrastructure, etc.). Others complained about the weight... of course 500 steel staples weigh 20lbs. They're steel. All of the reviews below 4 stars seem angry at the staples for the customer's own circumstances. Also, the coatings on ground staples have nothing to do with rust. Some of the more experienced reviewers don't understand this either. This is a manufacturing lubricant. It's there to let the metal wire slide smoothly through the bending equipment. The more grease or oil on the staple, the more damage you do to your soil. That's the second reason I purchased these staples as opposed to others. It's also a sign of quality materials and good storage practices that very little lube was needed to make the staples and keep them rust free in the box. The last brand I used was COVERED in graphite grease which took days to scrub off my hands.  These are awesome staples. I've installed several thousand staples from several companies over the last 4 years from landscaping to crop planting. These are the lessons I have learned. The round top creates a bunching effect when installing plastic or fabric, making the material less likely to tear off the staple on a windy day. The cinch effect also tightens the fabric or plastic you put down. The round top also allows for slightly deeper ground penetration, further tightening your install. The tighter your material, the less likely it is that wind will be able to get under, and remove it causing a re-install. I use black plastic sheeting as a chem-free defoliant that also draws very straight lines for crop and tree plantings. The less space between plastic and dirt the faster it cooks the soil clean.

Being a deskjockey and not a lumberjack, I did not realize that there are multiple sizes of these wedges.  I was looking for the large ones that you see on Axe Men.  What I actually purchased, however, were only slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes.  That said, these things work great.  I think, in the end, this size is actually much more practical for the average homeowner with medium to light duty needs.  I used these with great effect to drop a 20"", wrongly-leaning hardwood.  These offered just enough persuasion for the tree to go where I was asking it to go instead of onto my roof.  I think that the larger ones I was originally seeking would actually be too large for my needs.  I rarely work with anything larger than 24"" on my property, and if I do, I'm calling a tree service for the insurance.  For anything smaller, I think this size is just right to provide leverage while not being bulky enough to get in the way.  These guys are really solid, as well.  I began by driving them in with a hammer, which worked pretty well.  However, I quickly realized that it was much more efficient to use the sledge end of my splitting maul.  Perfect.  These plastic wedges totally held their own and I no longer worry about them cracking or giving out under the stress of driving them into the slot.  I'm sure I don't even need to mention this, but they are NOT, however, impervious to the actual teeth of the chainsaw, as I discovered.  A roaring chain will eat through them like butter and will also, I am here to attest, hurl them 50 feet across the yard if, say, the wedge were to fall onto the chain at the completion of a preventing a pinch when making a vertical cut.

One thing I've found is that an electric washer will never beat the power of a gas powered one. But gas powered are more maintenance, cost more, and are a lot larger.  The PS14133 is light enough that an adult can carry it one handed by the handle, so if you're traversing stairs on a deck, for example, it's light enough to lift.

Six Phillips head screws to attach the spool and nozzle brackets, two pins for the wheels, and the arm snaps in.  Attach the hose, turn on the water, press the handle, and let water flow for 30 seconds - NEVER run a pressure washer dry. You'd destroy it.  There are three tips - these are all that control the pressure.  The low pressure/blue tip is for washing and dispensing soap. The yellow tip produces a fan shaped spray, and the black/hp tip creates a cone.  The yellow and black tips both did an excellent job cleaning my deck and fence.  I also use the yellow tip for washing my pond filter pads.  The electrical cord has a CFCI connection, so it's safe to plug into a non-GFCI circuit.  This is a home owner's pressure washer that's great for periodic use - cleaning the deck and fence every few months, washing a boat or car, etc.  It also works for stripping old finishes  from wood lawn furniture - at least it did for me.  The power cord and pressure/water hose both store on the unit - that's handy. Four stars because the pressure is nice, but not fantastic.  Really stubborn cleaning jobs need a lot more pressure, but for 90% of home owners, this unit will do just fine.","Great pressure washer for home-owners, easy to use and assemble, light enough to carry.",1436918400,,,give nice produce pro power black non-gfci i've assemble use head dispense wheel strip adult sling connection model yellow dry handy boat four need fine washer spool destroy cost six stubborn job unit least phillips soap electrical furniture thing enough screws press flow owner tip cfci great minute pressure/water wash hand creates cord find handle safe star really consumer that's one beat fence lot pond turn lift traverse arm currently electric nozzle let low large spray black/hp able pressure/blue home engine maintenance use stair light month periodic deck fantastic pad snap etc also fan pressure still filter works finish water clean attach hose wood pin gas second tip never plug cone circuit car bracket two old try powered excellent run hernia owner's shape big-box lawn washer job example three every carry store control

Given that we have used other Miracle-Gro products, we were quite excited to try these seed pods in our northern Virginia garden.  Soon after receiving the seed pods, we planted them alongside tomatoes, bell peppers, and sundry other plants, some from seeds, and some from pots.  Most of our seeds are coming up.  Indeed, we will have to remove some seedlings to make room for the rest, which is fairly typical.  We always plant too many seeds. Unfortunately, only two of the eight seed pods, the zucchini and the cucumber, sprouted.  The other six are currently no shows.  We still remain hopeful that the other seed pods will sprout, but the zucchini and cucumber each have multiple leaves, and it has been more than two weeks since we put everything in the ground.  Accordingly, I am not hopeful that the rest will pop up.  My significant other noticed that the material in the seed pods was quite loose on receipt, which she attributed to the shipping of the seed pods.  She wonders whether the seeds ended up being either too shallow or too deep to sprout properly.  Her theory is interesting, but I have no way of testing that theory.  I do know that some seeds are relatively sensitive to depth, so it could be that her theory has merit.  Regardless, a 25% success rate of sprouted seeds is hardly anything to cheer.  Having had long experience in gardening, we are always up for something to help make gardening easier, though we have generally been quite successful in the past.  It seemed like these seed pods were something new and different.  Instead, we ended up using valuable space in our garden for non-sprouting seed pods.  We are disappointed, and are considering using that apparently wasted space for something else.  ***UPDATE***  Eventually the spinach also came up.  However, the rest of the seeds are permanently absent.  I do not ""hate"" this product, but when only three out of eight pods actually sprout and grow a plant, I am unable to provide any recommendation for this product.

They stood behind their product, good seller, good service. Thank you!  My first shaft seal failed years after the pump was installed, it was an easy fix to purchase a new seal from the local store and also a spare to keep on hand. In addition to the seal, the impeller also broke, the plastic threaded portion failed due to age. Luckily I had a spare for that also. A few weeks ago my pump began leaking again so I disassembled the unit and examined the parts. The shaft seal looked fine but the all of the gaskets were 24 years old so I thought I may as well order a kit. With everything cleaned, I reassembled but the leak remained. At that point I ordered this kit figuring I would do the entire job and save my spare shaft seal for the next time I needed one.  The kit arrived quickly and appeared to be all the correct parts. In addition to the kit, I also ordered the replacement impeller for my 1.5 HP Superpump (they now have a bronze threaded portion), thinking the current edition had the plastic threads which might fail and take out my new  shaft seal. Every surface was cleaned and the rubber components lightly lubricated for insertion. Once done, I reactivated the filtering system, no leaks, no unusual noises, just a quiet pump operating as it should.  All was good for a few days, however, the leak began again shortly thereafter. Thinking the housing gasket might be twisted or some other minor issue, I disassembled, inspected, and reassembled without finding a problem. No apparent crack in the housing, no twisted gaskets, no nothing.  At this point I am at a standstill. My suspicion is that the shaft seal has a defect which I cannot detect. As soon as I have a chance I will be installing my new, spare shaft seal. If the leak remains and is not the fault of this kit, I absolutely will update my review. If the seller offers to replace what might be a defective part, I will update with that also. STAY TUNED!  UPDATE July 13, 2017: Last Monday I replaced the new shaft seal which came in this kit with the one I had stashed away as an emergency spare. That particular seal had come directly from the Leslie's Pool store thirty miles from my home (a number of years ago). So far, no leaks have appeared. Seems the seal I purchased here is defective, so now I shall contact the seller to see what, if anything, they will do.","Had a bad shaft seal in the new kit, seller sending another kit i.e. stood behind their product.

278,682319,5,80.0,True,"05 8, 2017",A1ON7Q43N2XYE0,B0197TS3IK,Derek,"This weed tool is similar to the Weed Hound by Hound Dog.  My neighbor has the Hound Dog and it works incredible well.  I wanted the same one but it appears it is no longer available.  I searched and this item came up after a week or so.  For some reason it did not come up in the original searches.  I have used both the Hound Dog and this Worth item and I also compared it to the Hound Dog, side by side.  The Hound Dog appears to be built a little better, it has a better brace at the foot, has 6 spines rather than the 5 on the Worth, and the Hound Dog is a bit heaver.  The length of the spines on the Worth is the same as the Hound Dog.  Although spines on the Hound Dog appear to be a little stronger but so far no issue with the Worth.  After trying the Worth weeder, I find it works much like the Hound Dog.  It pulls the weeds well on a normal lawn (not a dry surface).  I was able to pull large as well as smaller dandelion weeds with no issue.  Obviously using it on really dry soil would be more difficult, makes sense to use it when the soil has enough moisture to easily push into the ground.  I was able to pull some crab grass, where it was easy to spot the center.  This tool also makes it easy to pick up weeds from the surface that dropped off the initial pull or loosely sitting on the ground.  Basically you never need to lean down to pick a week up, just aim the tool into a bucket or collection bin and press on the top round handle and the mechanism releases the weed.  This certainly is easier on my back, I can gather as many weeds as I have time to remove and don't get a sore back.  Pulling a weed with this tool does create a small hole in the lawn as it pulls a plug out around the weed.  The hole is small but I did notice that they don't immediately disappear.  Could fill them in with a little dirt but I don't think it is necessary and acts much like an aeration plug which is good for the lawn.  Removing weeds is very easy with this tool.  But you do need to hit the cent of the weed, if you miss then you have to try again, which means a second hold.  But if you miss you can put the plug back into the hole using the tool,  The tool does allow easy manipulation of a weed or plug.  The pressing of the level on top to release the weed does require a good hit and this can start to wear down your palm after a large number of weeds.  But I find it less of an issue over the old Hound Dog.  Wearing a pair of work gloves does alleviate the pressure on the palm.  Also, I found you really don't have to hit it hard, you can press on it till it releases but it is a little slower.  I also own the Fiskar 3 claw weed remover.  I bought this several years ago and it does not work well on small weeds, only very large dandelions.  I found it too much of a hassle to use.  This Worth tool is many times better and easy to use.  You can make a serious dent on dandelion weeds in your lawn in short time using this tool.  I think the overall quality is ok, not a good as the Hound Dog but close.

The main selling feature was the ""no spill"" automatic shut off valve on the can.  The can dispenses fuel really quickly, which is nice, especially when trying to awkwardly hold a full 5-gallon jug upside down.  However, the ""automatic shut off"" only works OK.  There is a short delay between the valve getting submerged in liquid, and the flow to stop.  My scooter's fuel tank has a rather short filler neck, and so by the time the gas is shut off, the fuel has come almost all the way up the filler neck, which is a no-no.  What I have to do is listen very carefully for a sound which indicates the flow is starting to slow down and immediately release the valve.  That seems to keep the fuel level right at the bottom of the filler neck.  But if I were to hold the valve down until the automatic shut off stopped the flow, the fuel would be all the way up the filler neck, and maybe even overflowing.

What I did find is the bacteria treatment over-all is working quite well but I ended up doing a shock treatment on my ponds with pure bacteria from www.organicpond.com and that has made a real difference quite quickly and their prices were definitely better than pond clear and muck maid ( 4 gallons for apprx 120.00 that treats 4 surface acres or 1 surface acre for 4 months).

They tout 1 foot or more of muck a season when used with aeration (http://www.clean-flo.com).

The mouse enters a small tunnel with a ramp that should lower with the weight of the mouse and trigger the door to close. I put bait inside and some small bits of peanut butter on the outside of the trap to lure the mouse over. The peanut butter was removed from the outside of the trap regularly, but no mice were caught. So I finally put some peanut butter on the far end of the ramp that should lower, assuming that if a mouse was sitting there, it should theoretically be caught... that peanut butter was eaten as well and still no mice in the trap. I really like the idea of this trap because it's more humane than some of the other live traps- there are ventilation holes and a larger area for the mouse to move around. Since I work long hours I wanted to be sure that a mouse wouldn't have to sit for too long in a smaller, poorly ventilated trap and possibly die by the time I was able to remove it. Unfortunately, the trap just isn't working for me, but since others have had success I feel it may be due to the size of the mouse I'm trying to catch. I guess I'll have a better idea if I ever catch the thing.",Maybe for heavier mice,1324857600,"{'Size:': ' EACH', 'Item Package Quantity:': ' 1', 'Package Quantity:': ' 1'}",,theoretically move poorly door i'll work small like ever hour ventilation guess others eat area humane assume tunnel thing enough due mouse sure possibly want feel trap size long well unfortunately trigger put catch really ventilated success far try large live able outside trap sit weight butter time lure mouse close still small finally functional inside remove caught sit idea catch i'm around since ramp die work enters hole end regularly well bits remove bait weigh may lower peanut

I always have 3 or 4 in service at any one time and alternate them during a nectar change.  This one is very tiny at 8 ounces but it is very attractive to the hummingbirds.  I was able to capture one hummingbird at this feeder within hours of putting this out (see video attached; sorry for the sideways view).  FACTS  - It comes in three pieces (bottom, reservoir, and top piece) and it is all plastic.  - One S hook was provided for hanging.  - The feeder is easy to assemble and disassemble.  - Reservoir is easy to fill and clean.  - There are four feeding ports.  - It has tiny perches for the hummingbirds.  - The flowers have built-in bee guards to protect the nectar from bees.  - There's a built-in ant moat on the top that can be filled with water to keep the ants away.  - It comes with one package of instant nectar mix good for the first fill.  - It is made in the U.S.A.  CONS  - I found it almost impossible to remove the nectar package because it was inserted deeply into the reservoir. Due to the pinch neck design, I needed skinny tongs to pull it out.  However, this is a one-time only problem.  - I found that when turning the feeder right-side up after filling, the nectar shoots out of the flowers for that one moment.  Therefore, I recommend turning the feeder in the sink. I did not do that and I had nectar splatter all over my counter.  The feeder did not leak after I hung it, however; this only happens during a nectar change.  - Based on my experience with both glass and plastic feeders, glass is always my first choice.  The intense rays of the sun can make the plastic brittle or expand unlike with their glass feeders. However, having said that, I really love most of their feeders as long as they don't leak. The plastic ones are good in the shade.  As usual, this does not come with instructions on making your own nectar. I make my own clear nectar with one part white sugar to four parts water (for example, one cup of sugar to four cups of boiling water; stir and cool). The feeder should be cleaned and the nectar replaced every three to four days.  In summary, although I'm a fan of glass feeders, I really like the cuteness of this feeder and the hummingbirds love it.  In fact the hummers have been attracted to every Perky Pet feeder that I have every tried.  For those who are interested, I've attached my reviews of several of my other feeders in the comments section of this review.

Style,"There was a similar Orbit package offered at [...] (spring only?) that costs less and has three valves instead of two and included two quick disconnect couplings as well.  At their price it would be economical to buy a new one every year (I've found that many non-commercial grade sprinklers only last a season or two any way, so why expect more from this particular item.)  Now, this system allows you to have up to three watering sessions per day, with each outlet timed for an independent amount during the session -- but that same time is used for each session -- so it's great if you have a number of stations and you want to repeat the same program several times a day.  It won't help you if you want to operate different stations at differrent times of the day (but if it's cheap enough, just buy two).  Haven't had any problems yet.  They are made of plastic so I could see how tugging strongly on a hose connected to it could probably break a valve.  Also probably a good idea to bring them inside for the winter.  Really hot direct sunlight might be a problem too.  But in a moderate climate I think they'll be OK.  Programming and changing the program can be a headache until you get the hang of it.  This probably seems like a negative review, but if this is the sort of timer that you need and your environment isn't too hasrsh, it should work quite well.

The sprayer bottle - so important that a lot of people don't think of - is made very well.  I like the adjustments on it and it will hold up to repeated use so I know I can buy the refill and count on having a bottle to put it in.  I didn't get it for bed bugs but flour moths, flies and those tiny roaches that get in my sun room where my parrots cages are.  It worked GREAT on the flour moths and flies and I really love the scent.  It MAY have worked on those tiny roaches but I couldn't tell because they scampered off - hopefully to die.  I mixed about 25% CedarCide with it and it worked beautifully.  When I sprayed one of the nasty little buggers with the CedarCide added to it, within seconds I could see them begin to die.  This time I'm getting a gallon size to mix with my CedarCide.  It works great, smells great (better than the CedarCide), not greasy like CedarCide and saved me a lot of money.

The look had additional marketing appeal for my landscaping company, something to set us aside from others.  However, I wasn't really sure they'd suit a functional purpose, so I tentatively ordered the shovel to give it a trial run and to see if I could live with it.  I've since gone out and stocked up on all the NRG-PRO tools, their hand tools, and I'm looking forward to at least some of the NRG-STX series tools as well.  All of the tools have a great balance. They are easier to control and carry materials across distances ~ a simple open hand across the circular handle keeps them from spinning and dropping whatever they're carrying. I've also found the handle design helps keep them from rolling or causing too much trouble when toting them around across the arms of a wheelbarrow.  The nice green does seem to get dulled quickly from the mud and, even when washed clean, still loses that new-tool shine. The business end has no such problems and remains easy to clean even when it has a right not to.  I'm tall ~ over 6' ~ and I never thought I'd like the short handles on these, however, I've found they're more comfortable even digging down below grade. This is a bit of personal taste, as my son, slightly shorter than I, prefers long handled tools.  I've snapped several expensive, pro-quality forks, and have yet to manage to do any damage to this one at all.  I've mistaken it for a prybar, and used it to remove rocks of a variety of sizes.  I've also used it to remove about 30 or so square feet of hosta, two mature lilacs, and a mature rose-of-sharon.  On one job, this fork moved upwards of 11 cubic yards of mulch... and those are just some of the highlights!  If I could only have two of the NRG-PRO tools, it would be the spade and this fork.

I installed on my backyard on a 7ft pole that I converted and reused from an old outdoor table umbrella.  I repainted it silver and put a clear coating on it.  I upload a picture when I have the time. PROs: It does everything a fancy expensive 500 dollar weather station but maybe with less accuracy when compare to them.  I love it does all of the basic like temp for indoor/outdoor, raindrop measurement, wind speed/direction, dew-point, humidity, feel like temperatures, and heat index.  It does a weather forecast and has a ticker with great information about the weather status. CONs: I was almost fooled about the color display.  The so called color display is just color clear pictures on the background with LCD display digitals.  What does this mean?  The contrast resolution display of the text is very limited to viewing sweet spot.  Like all LCD display if the viewing angles are off the LCD display letters and number are very hard to see.  We originally have plan to mount this display unit up on a wall (unit has wall mount hole for it) over 6FT but it is not possible for me or my little 6 years old kid to see it.  The outdoor sensor device has a solar panel but it is only to run an internal fan to suck in air for getting the temperature and humidity.  I just wish it doesnt take 4 AA batteries to run the outdoor sensor.  The whole weather station is wireless and use MAC address but not compatible with directly communication with their smart phone app.  The unit needs to be connected back to a USB port to your computer to upload of the data that supposed to last about two weeks. This display unit was meant to be display on a work desk or kitchen island where a person when standing sees it in very good and high contrast.  We finally found a great place and put it near our kitchen counter next to our microwave oven.  We mount it to a wall there where is very low touch the bottom of the kitchen tile.  Even this low my kids still have problem seeing it (it was fine for adults to see) so we angled it downward for our kid by pulling our wall mount nail outward to give it that drop down angle and that finally allow our kids to see it.

What I like about this station is that the indoor unit can run on batteries or AC power. Instead of feeding it batteries I have it plugged into an outlet. The outdoor unit runs on two AAA batteries (batteries are not included).  The display is clear and colorful. It shows both the indoor and outdoor temperature and weather prediction. One thing you need to be aware of is that this product displays time and date in the European format with the date first and the month second. I was able to change the temperature to Fahrenheit but have not been able to change the date format.  This is not a big deal for me as I have other calendars in the room, but in case it does matter to someone I wanted to include this info.  The outside temperature does not appear instantly. Documentation states that it can take up to 3 hours. However, even in three hours it did not do it on its. I was able to fix this problem my pressing the button labelled ""Mem"" on the back. Note that this loss of connectivity happens every time you unplug AC or change the battery, so I now just press ""Mem"" button right away and the weather station syncs with the remote unit right away.  FINDING A GOOD LOCATION: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (1) The outdoor unit should be in the shade (2) The outdoor unit should be somewhat protected from the rain (3) It should not be higher than 5 feet from the ground (4) Should be placed on the surface that does not get warm (for example glass or metal are bad choices, wood is a good choice)  I have been placing my weather station sensors under the deck. This is close enough to the main unit to provide strong signal and meets all of the recommendations listed above.  The manual states that the accuracy of the weather station is +/- 2.7F and I see about 1 degree difference with my other thermometer. This is within stated accuracy and the display is much easier to read than the old weather station.  This weather station was provided by Avantek.

I have dozens of hummingbirds at my location and have used a plethora of feeders over the decades.  Long story short ... I prefer glass feeders to plastic.  Non decorative vs. decorative (decorations are for humans not the birds; birds can get caught in the froufrou decorations).  This feeder, while glass, has its issues.  The glass does not screw into the base.  Like a lens to a camera, you line up the bumps with the opening and turn about 20 degrees to "" lock"" glass into plastic base.  One of the 2 that I purchased didn't lock properly; hence leaking.  After getting the 2nd feeder properly filled, I attempted to affix it to the window.  I knew immediately it would be a challenge. The suction cups are tucked into a protective circle of hard plastic.  I am assuming this plastic gives the holder more stability on the feeder itself, but it doesn't allow you to push down on the suction cups to create the suction necessary for a proper hold. Putting suction cups on first and then sliding feeder over them wasn't successful either.  I am certain there are a few individuals who have gotten this feeder to hold properly. However, despite my degrees in math and engineering, I am not one of them.  I get great joy out of filling and hanging the feeders. The hummingbirds actually swarm around me when I am hanging them.

1069,660803,2,,True,"07 18, 2018",A2K5QBGSY6FMZB,B014M9PEXC,carobearo,"Yes, it is a very light hose. When they say ""zero G"", they really, really mean it. I don't say that as a compliment.  The problem is, no, it is not ultra flexible, except when it doesn't have water in it.  Worse, it has a mind of its own. It will suddenly leap up off the ground and flop over onto my delicate potted plants, smashing their branches and even knocking smaller pots over.  I bought this hose to replace an $8 drinking-water-quality hose I'd found at WalMart. The reason that I didn't find that hose acceptable was that it's pretty stiff plastic, which meant that it required a lot of space in which to drag it around in a wide circle. I have a very small yard which I have packed full of potted plants, with narrow walking paths all through the pots. I needed a TRULY ""ULTRA FLEXIBLE"" hose to navigate through the yard.  The best hose that I've ever used for tiny, fussy spaces like this is the kind that is sold as an ""RV hose"". These hoses, too, are very lightweight and very flexible, but *they lay flat on the ground* as you walk around with them, even if there is a trigger sprayer on the end. However, they recently stopped making those hoses with metal ends. I broke the plastic end of one of them after only 6 months, and the last one I bought came pre-leaking. So I had to give up on that kind of hose.  But it never occurred to me that I could expect the Zero-G to rear up several feet in the air and lay waste to my fuchsias and drag dirt all over my clothing in the process, and then continue to flop back and forth onto the plants as I pulled it down the garden path.  It doesn't help to turn the pressure to the hose down. When I do so, yes, the hose does relax quite a bit, but ONLY as long as I am pulling the trigger. As soon as I let go of the trigger, the pressure in the hose builds up again allowing it to stiffen so that it can continue its snake-dance. So I need to walk around with the hose constantly running to maintain its flexibility. And anyway, to get this relaxation effect, I have to turn the pressure down so far that I then don't have sufficient pressure to complete my tasks.  If you have a big, wide open lawn in which to wrestle with this magic snake, or if you just need to drag a hose across the driveway to wash a car, then this is probably a good hose for you. I recommend wearing your bathing suit, though, because the hose *will* bounce up off the ground and attack you. Also great for kids who want to pretend to be snake charmers.  (I'm not sure, but I think the reason that it behaves this way is that the inner plastic hose is not actually attached to the outer cloth sleeve. Thus, even if I am firmly grasping the hose with two hands, it can still merrily twist out of my grasp.)  Other than the difficulty controlling the hose, I don't like the material itself. I had assumed that because this is a *hose*, the cloth sleeve wouldn't be absorbent. I don't want to get so wet simply because I am watering my pots.",has a mind of its own,1531872000,"{'Size:': ' 5/8"" x 25\''}",,give sleeve bounce snake-dance plastic air build magic find i've quite onto branch control clothing wash way absorbent wet like come leap wide ever sell delicate space however recommend space cloth pot rear twist occur dirt bathing could simply smash need knock actually task yard think open walk garden relax last get circle several wear bad pot suddenly i'd sprayer expect big problem drinking-water-quality great make sure relaxation hand navigate path behaves driveway long find firmly wrestle packed trigger sufficient really water one compliment replace lot pull need stop back turn waste walk attack let flop far fuchsias suit foot yes reason soon pretend kind material good hose use probably outer truly effect bit light want full across assumed month zero walmart help grasp mind flexibility thus difficulty metal break pre-leaking merrily rv narrow plant also pressure lightweight end pull maintain small anyway path complete even charmer water ground stiffen hose forth lay except recently drag inner kid buy never process run constantly fussy continue car around i'm still best two required snake meant mean attach though end zero-g stiff grasp tiny flat acceptable go ultra lawn allow say flexible small pretty

The wooden ones started breaking in different ways and on others the wheels tipped, broke off or rusted and would no longer turn.  I'd finally had it when I was moving all the pots for deck refinishing and noticed  two caddies holding heavy pots scratched the deck when I moved them.  I bought more of this type to replace all the others before I moved the pots back into place to avoid scratching the new finish.  These roll easily and smoothly.  They are very sturdy and won't rot when wet.  I also like that they allow for pot drainage better than others that have a solid base.  They aren't decorative, but mostly you don't see them at all or just the wheels.

That is what makes this review all the worse. It is hard to be disappointed when your expectations are low. My good lawn mower died on me at the end of July. I didn't have a ton of money to spend this late in the season on a replacement so I was looking for something relatively inexpensive that could get me through the rest of this year. If it didn't work next year not the end of the world. I looked on amazon at several different models and for the price and the reviews this one seemed like it would work. It had some negative reviews but more good than bad so I figured those few who wrote bad reviews just were unlucky or expected too much for the price. I was wrong. This thing is the biggest waste of money every. If you pay 20 bucks for it you over spent because all it is good for is scrap. I took the lawn mower out of the box CAREFULLY followed all of the directions for set up pulled the rip cord and... nothing. Not only nothing but the cord didn't go back in. I rewound the rip cord and tried again... still nothing. Amazon of course DOES NOT DO RETURNS on lawn mowers. I've called the company to see if I could get any help but apparently they close at 5pm est... Even if they fix it for free... which i doubt they will this has been such a headache that I still feel like I should at least get some money back... but it doesn't look like that is going to happen.

When pea algae turned my Florida (largely in the sun) pond green, I knew I needed a long term solution to avoid chemicals that might be harmful to birds and other wildlife using the pond, along with my cats and dogs. I turned to the IonGen system after reading several reviews and speaking with my son.  My son warned against it, though he said his experience with the system was in small ponds where it killed the fish,  Since I have a large pond and as I am an ease-of-installation and use-- kind of guy, I chose to purchase the IonGen.  I gave it 10 days to make a difference at the highest setting in my large green pond.  On the next day, as it was not clear enough for my taste and a few fish had (4) turned up dead, and many more, plus a gazillion tadpoles were simply missing or out-of-sight, I had to apply an additional remedy.  I added enough algae chemical-fix for 2000 gallons and enough pond clarifier for the entire 8000 gallons; I kept my pets and the birds away.  I also have a large waterfall with biological filters and balls and a pump that runs 8000 gallons/hour in order to quickly disperse the chemicals.  The next day I could see the bottom @ about 3 1/2 feet.  I could also see all my Hornwort (a dark green underwater plant) was dying and soon huge chunks of it showed up in the skimmer.  Okay, with all that said; its been weeks now and I have since lowered the IonGen to 5 and no new algae has appeared.  My water Iris, snowflakes and other water plants are thriving.  No more fish or plants have been harmed and a biological balance is being achieved.  I found three much larger Brim thriving and I notice my two grey armored catfish had grown considerably, all of which I accepted as the explanation for the missing fish and tadpoles.  So would I recommend the IonGen to others?  You bet.

This pump is the smallest in the Intex sand filter line and puts out 1050 gph. I have had it now for a bought a week and it is really keeping the pool water clear. Before with the original filter that came with the pool my younger son, nieces, and there friends used it once and the pool was really dirty and would not clean at all. So picked this pump and the pool is crystal clear and I run it for only two hrs a day with the kids playing in it every day. For the price it's worth getting only if it's for one summer, or use it till it breaks. If you want easier  maintenance get the Intex salt water chlorinator also worth it. You can do pool chemicals but you have to keep up on a lot more. The only thing I don't like about this size filter is the leaf trap and how it's designed on this smallest of the Intex sand filter pump. Wish it was designed like the other ones. You have to stop the water flow from pool to pump with valves or plug and on the bigger ones 2100 gph and higher you don't need to cut of the flow of water to clean out the leaf trap.

This Fiskars tool has it all put together in a pruner that is easy to use, easy to lock, and cuts through thick and thin branches quickly.  There are other features of this particular pruner that I appreciate, too:  The tool is so tightly and precisely put together that the blades cannot separate under pressure--that means there is no opportunity for binding.  (Less well-designed and cheaper pruners have some weakness at the spot where the two blades are joined, and that allows for two cut surfaces in the wood, and the wood in the middle causes the pruner to bind.)  The blades are very sharp and the metal has a non-stick finish that does not wear off easily.  I can say this because this is my second Fiskars pruner like this.  I also have an earlier model--from a few years ago--and the blades on that older Power Gear pruner are still sharp, still cutting easily, still opening and closing with ease.  (The main differences in the older one and this newest model seems to be the locking position and where it is located, and also a bit different grip.)  On this newest model I can maneuver the open/close locking tab with my thumb as I hold the pruner.  The size of these cutting blades is a good choice for a variety of branch thicknesses.  This is the pruner I carry with me as I attend to our gardens.  This size works well for everything from cutting rose and other flower blooms to trimming bushes and small trees.  I even do some deadheading with this pruner.  This is a good size for picking bell peppers, eggplant, cukes and such.  (I do use a smaller Fiskars clipper for green beans, herbs and small deadheading.  I use a Fiskars lopper for bigger limbs.)

We didn't want to spend a lot because we already have a nice grill we'd eventually be moving there.  After a great deal of research we settled on the Weber Spirit.  And much to our surprise we got more performance than we expected.  Our Genesis has a sear burner, and because of that the left side of the grill does what I expect from an expensive grill.  The right side of the Genesis, not so much.  After using the smaller Spirit I can see the three burners heating a smaller cooking area provide me with much the same result I get on the left side of our Genesis.  Of course after retiring we'll be moving the Genesis to sit side by side with the Spirit.  I already know I'll be using the Spirit most of the time and using the Genesis only when we have guests and need more cooking surface.  However, if I were starting again and needed a grill with a larger cooking area I believe I'd get two Spirit grills instead of a Genesis or Summit.  That's how much I like the Spirit E320.  It heats more evenly across the entire surface of the grill than any grill I've ever used, and that includes some fairly pricey equipment owned by friends.  One thing I want to mention is the cast iron grill grates.  When my son-in-law installed the grates on the grill he placed them just as I've seen them in every store where I've see the grill, with the pointy end of the V-shape pointing up.  It seems logical.  However, when installed this way the horizontally running support bar interferes with the smooth surface and you can't slip a spatula across the entire grill.  Examining the grill grate more closely you will see what looks to be little pads in the corners where the grill grate would be resting on the firebox.  I flipped the grill grates over and now use them that way, even though at first it seems wrong.  I believe this is how Weber intends them to be installed.  And BTW, although I have the stainless steel grates on my Genesis I don't really prefer one grill grate type over the other.  Even heat over the entire cooking surface is what I'm looking for, and that's what I get with the Spirit E320.  In case you're wondering about the utility of the side burners, I find them quite useful as I don't have to keep running back and forth to the kitchen to attend to something on the stovetop.  If you feel Webers are overpriced, a comment I've heard when looking over grills at the big box stores, I feel they're worth it.  I purchased my new Genesis when I saw that Weber changed their burner arrangement from across to up and down.  The Genesis I was using at the time was 23 years old.  I gave it to a friend who is still using it.  The only thing that's been changed is the burner units, and it's now 27 years old and still cooking.  How many grills left outdoors and mostly uncovered last that long?

It's light weight, 23 pounds or so, and as long as you have an electrical outlet you can use the product. The heating element were able to be adjusted to one of 3 different positions which was what I wanted, flat, 45 degrees, and perpendicular, or verticle position for rotisserie function which I really wanted.  My product search showed no other product available that did this and was the clincher for buying the product. Now the downside: 1. The package was delivered and left out in the rain and got soaked but did not damage the product. We all know plastic bags are available.  FedEx was the culprit. Just irresponsible. 2. The assembly brochure is written hieroglyphics. Blurry illustrations and badly written text explanations. It's a mishmash of information intermingling several different models.  I had to look at the carton to determine what model I bought by manufacturers part number to tie in the instructions. 3. The nuts and bolts assembly required did not include lock washers...now really, we all know things come lose without washers, which I had in my workshop and provided myself...we are talking pennies here. 4.

The metal frame has metal corners, not the plastic ones found on other tents, which was a plus. It feels shaky & I was concerned about stability at first. But I have 3 air cooled hoods hanging, which is the max I would suggest, considering the frame structure. I am on my 3rd cycle using this tent & it is still holding up just fine. I wish the front zipper zipped from the bottom up, rather than from the top down. This is because when you unzip it, the negative air pressure pulls the flaps inward & I am always afraid they will hit my plants. But I am aware of the issue & don't allow that to happen. Also, after using the front zipper as much as I doo, I noticed the zipper was starting to seperate a bit at the very top. This is because of how often it is opened & closed. However, I took a little needle & thread & just reinforced it a bit with a few stitches to prevent it from tearing or coming apart, which worked out well. Another thing I really like is that the bottom has an insert which is about 4 inches tall, which catches any spillage or overflow if you are growing hydro. I accidentally leaked about a gallon or two of water by knocking off a drip line & the tray caught all the water, which I just used a shop-vac to clean up. But it prevented it from soaking the floor beneath the tent. I expect to get several more grows from this tent & I would definitely buy this tent again if I needed to. I would probably also position a new tent in such a way that I use the side openings to access my reservoir, because like I said, the front zipper/opening is a bit tight & over time the zipper will wear a bit.

We were worried about the ease of setting it up, because neither of us is extremely handy, but it went up great, and anything we weren't sure about, we called on. Customer Service for this company is GREAT!!!  After filling, we thought we would have a long wait, outdoor temp is 60, and the water from the hose was the same. It was up to 90 the next morning, and yesterday afternoon was 98, so we got in! It was wonderful, but couldn't wait for the full temp of 104. It felt almost too hot when I got in this morning, but the temp drops a bit when you get in, with it open, and the bubbler going.   When I got out, it was 100 and felt really good! The construction is mor heavy-duty than the pictures look, and it is very comfortable! I was afraid that it would need more cushion on the bottom, but it was fine, and we have it set up on the patio (cement) with a patio carpet under it. That is only for esthetics.  Now I want to find some mineral salts, for a therapeutic effect. I am glad that the company said no chlorine, as I hate chemicals.  This is a great little spa for the price, and giving us an idea how a big one will be, if we decide to get one later on. Not sure about keeping it running all winter (Colorado), perhaps move it to the basement?  Hubby loves it too, and he was the skeptic!  Updated: We still love it! I mistakenly added too much chlorine, looking to save a buck and reading spa forums. I called Oceantis CS and got GREAT assistance! The gentleman I spoke to expained how to open the pump unit and I discovered that the probes were corroded. I was going to buy a new unit, but had to have hip surgery and so now can't get into or out of the spa without possibly damaging my hip. :( Very sorry to let the spa go, it is almost like new, except for the heater/pump. I had chlorinated water circulating with a submersible pump all winter and it is sparkling clean! Do not do this with the heat/pmp attached!    The outside of the spa is wonderful and sturdy. The liner is great if you follow directions and keep it clean as well as using the manufacturers' recommended chemicals. The spa does lose heat as other people have said, but I used it year around in Colorado, and didn't plan to stay in for an hour, although my son and his girlfriend did! :D The solar cover and the inflatable cover are great, although the solar cover lost some of the metallic layer the second year. Altogether, this is one of the best items I have ever bought, and if my hip recovers to the point that I can use one again, I'll buy another!   Oh, we also added some insulation under the liner and between the liner and the spa sides. And as far as what one person said about having to be a mechanic to use this, that's hogwash! I am a 65 year old woman, I admit I can use tools if I need to, but I took it down and put the insulation in and put it back up in an hour.

I only caught two yellow jackets in these traps all year, along with a bunch of moths and assorted other bugs.  I assume they would have been more effective out at the edge of the woods, but I got these traps because they were nice enough to have out where I could see them.

I'd load a charcoal chimney, get them hot, dump them in the Weber, grill, then serve.  I found myself using them less and less though so my wife bought me a propane grill.  For grillin' the propane worked great and was so convenient.  My Webers were put in deep sleep while I propane grilled on average 50 to 100 times a year.  After many years I went looking online to see if there was another use for the hibernating Weber Kettles.  I quickly learned how to turn it into a smoker and an outdoor oven using just a few aftermarket accessories.  Using two fire bricks as a heat fence, charcoal, smoking wood, a good digital oven thermometer, and a proper charcoal/wood ""snake"" you have a near competition class smoker!  I dusted off the Webers and have been using them to smoke everything from ribs to turkeys.  I've cooked low 'n slow and hot n' fast with fantastic results, leaning more and more toward the hot n' fast style for saving time.  The Weber Kettles are not just grills!  In fact I don't use mine for grillin' at all since I have the gas grill for steaks, burgers, and hot dogs.  Now the gas grill gets very little use and the Webers are king once again in our backyard. You can smoke two pork butts or chickens on Saturday and have enough leftovers for the whole week!  And turkeys?  Brine a turkey and smoke it on the Weber for the best turkey you'll ever eat!

1483,300624,5,,True,"01 4, 2015",AYDZ6G3HG1R7Z,B0036F7HX4,Georgia Girl,"These work great. I had a big problem with pantry moths.  Of course, you can't just rely on these.  You must take action to throw out any food in doubt.  The life cycle of these moths is several months.  I threw out much food,  You would not believe the tiny spaces the larvae worms will live in.  They only need a spec of food to live on.  Unscrew a cap from one of your jars and you may find one in the groves of the bottle or one in a box of clear wrap.  They hide on your wire shelves.  Food that seems clumpy are a clue that a larvae is living in that food.  I had to go through a lot to get rid of the moths, but I did the hard work and I got rid of them.  If you want to get rid of them clean out your pantry, vacuum the walls and shelves, wash the shelves with a clorax mixture, paint the pantry, and use these traps.  Do not place two traps close together; 20-feet apart is the recommended distance.  These traps attract the male moths with the scent the female moth sends out. If they are too close together, it confuses the male moth and he doesn't know where to go.  I placed one trap in the pantry, and in every closet I had in the house, and one on top of the refrigerator.  Once a larvae turns into a moth, it flies around looking for the scent of a female and the moth can go into another closet and settle there.  Moths like to fly high and they are most active at night and are attracted to light.  So place these traps at the highest point in closets.  This trap will not help with females; but then if there are no male moths around, the female cannot mate to lay eggs, which turn into larvae in about 2 weeks.  The eggs are almost impossible to see. I found a few; they just looked like tiny yellow stains and you would not know they are eggs.  The damaging stage of these moths is the larvae stage.  Once they are moths, they no longer eat.  But they then mate and lay more eggs and the cycle begins again.  I thought I had done an excellent job of finding the larvae and getting rid of it.  I even put the pantry food I did not throw out into Lock and Lock containers to isolate anything I missed.  And I did miss some.  I could see a moth in a few containers and opened then opened the container outside and  threw out the food in that container.  I also put some of the pantry food in the refrigerator, which is a place the moths will not go nor survive in.  But I still caught about 27 moths after that in these traps.  I found at least one of 2 moths in the traps in each closet ( and found a garment or two with moth-eaten holes in them) and a lot of moths in the pantry trap and the trap on top of the refrigerator.  You just have to be diligent, patient, and do the work that must be done to get rid of them.  By the way, I got the moths from birdseed I had stored on the back porch.  When I opened the container of bird seed, some moths flew out and my back door must have been every-so-slightly opened for them to get into the house.  Foolish of me, I did not get rid of that bird seed immediately.  I knew birds ate moths so thought it would be ind.  I never figured on the moths flying into the house.  I did not know I had them until they became a problem.  The sooner you see them the easier it is to get rid of them because one female moth can lay up to 300 eggs!  The moth life cycle slows down in cool weather and is probably non-existent in  the very cold.  But the eggs can last longer than a year before they hatch so don't get fooled - do the work your need to do to rid your home of them.","They work, but you have to work too.",1420329600,{'Size:': ' 6 pack'},,know moth-eaten mixture wall hard female house container much door cold every-so-slightly week find use thought work damage clorax longer refrigerator scent wash rid way like immediately ind space yellow attract fly could grove need wrap clue turn threw open action job night worm apart closet last can't least get high several non-existent hatch spec take seem paint big problem recommend great mate clean must fly trap place find box look eat stage put food seed stain lock course one clumpy lot turn back eggs closet porch place fool high distance point fly bird live pantry believe easy home diligent foolish probably fly together outside hide trap male isolate cannot want light almost active cool month help find miss shelf get would live birdseed top bird also close bottle rely jar still miss figure see even moth become slows lay cap settle vacuum catch sends container unscrew never around sooner two female doubt cycle garment hole excellent life store larvae weather impossible patient wire tiny go confuses know year get throw another do every may anything look survive ate clear begin attract moth

The original premise was that the red color reflected on the tomatos making them ripen faster.  There are other items that make the same claim like red plastic lining and those cheap flimsy red ones with a slit that tear the plant to pieces and break in half when trying to get them around the stem.  I have both these and the Automator which is a similar product.  These are far superior; they are heavy duty plastic and hold up very well over the years.  They come in two sections with a large hole for the plant stem.  They are very easy to install as the two pieces snap together with no damage to the plants.  The bottom Is flat so I just wiggle it a little in the dirt and they sit flat, it has drainage holes.  It keeps snails and slugs away from your plants.

There are plusses and minuses.  On the good side, I had no trouble getting the unit set up, only had to attach the handle.  Parts went together intuitively after some study so I didn't have to read the booklet.  What I couldn't figure out was how you stored all the stuff.  Yes there's a little rack for three extension wands on one side and a little hook on the other but the hook isn't big enough to hold the very long electrical cord, and the water cord is even more awkward to deal with.  Should be a big hook on the back for that.  I was a little freaked about all the water and the electrical cord, but there were no issues as I hauled the thing around washing the car and then some siding.  Still I kept the extension plug as much out of the way as I could.  I may not have had the hose attached tightly enough to the water intake connection as there was a spraying leak but it didn't seem to affect performance which was better than expected.  It's not a high pressure unit but does do a good job for its size.  Should have a better washer though.  I didn't try any of the extra pieces or the soap bottle and can't speak to those but  was very satisfied with the basic operation which was easy.  The unit isn't heavy and can be carried around easily.  I have a gravel drive so the wheels don't really work for me.  The only problem that I found aggravating were the cords.  Notice they aren't shown in the pictures.  Both the one for the water wand and the power cord are loooong.  This is great for moving around while you are using the washer, but not good when you're trying to move it to and from your storage area to set it up and put it away.  I wish the cords were not both black so they were easier to tell apart.  They are a pain to recoil and there's no good way to keep them tidily with the unit.  I hope to find a really big carabiner that I can attach to the handle and that will also hold the water cord.  I'll also try to rig something on the side for the power cord.

I also bought the 33% and the 75% humidity calibration kits from Ambient Weather.  I'm very happy with the EP8706. It reads to one-tenth of a percent humidity and one-tenth of a degree Fahrenheit and has nearly instantaneous response time for both humidity and temperature.  Humidity calibration of the EP8706 is simple, but the cal kits must be purchased separately. The Ambient Weather cal kits that I bought include a transparent zip-top bag for each cal point that's large enough to put the EP8706 inside and seal it up. The button-presses needed to carry out the cal cycle are easily done right through the zip-top bag. Several vendors offer small ""pill-box"" calibrators, but I wasn't sure the EP8760's probe would fit the small hole in the ""pill-box"" properly, so I went with the zip-top bag type. Once you place the instrument inside the bag and seal it closed you can move it around and handle it without being concerned about compromising the cal cycle.  No temp calibration is available on the EP8706, but when it's compared to an NIST-traceable lab-quality Omega HH21 thermocouple thermometer they agree within two-tenths of a degree.  My new Davis weather station was within Davis' tech specs when it was shipped, and now I'm confident that it's humidity and temperature data is as accurate as it can possibly be.

It was a little marginal when we moved in, and has only gotten moreso over the years. I decided it was finally time to replace it. My goals were: had to fit on current pad. I wanted to be able to stand upright easily. I wanted it brighter, and well ventilated - the old shed was perpetually dark and dank, with about a 5 foot height at the peak.  I started looking at this shed due to it's unique size. There are lots of 8x10 sheds, but this was 10x8 - the door was on the long dimension. Not only would this fit my pad better, it meant items have less of a tendency to end up ""in the back"" behind a bunch of other things.  Shopped a lot, and ultimately ordered here on Amazon, as the price was substantially better than my local stores. While shopping/waiting, watched a few YouTube videos on assembly (search on 10x8, not 8x10). Not necessary, but picked up a few tips, that might have saved us a little ""figuring out time"".  Shed arrived in just a few days - much faster than I thought. Mine was shipped via Ceva Logisitics. They were great. Got a call when it was available, to schedule delivery, and had emails almost every day with status and reminders. They delivered at the scheduled time, and maneuvered the delivery into my backyard patio (a somewhat complicated path) as requested.  It arrived on a very long pallet - at least double long, and standard width. They had a pallet jack, but it was complicated as they had to carry it in the ""long"" dimension"" to get through gates. and the ""nose"" tended to drag. Two boxes, stacked on top of each other. My neighbor joked that it looked like a coffin. That is about the size. perhaps a bit taller. The shipping weight was between 500 and 600 pounds.  I'm 50ish, and fairly handy. I arranged for a couple of my nephews to spend some time with me to assemble. One is Jr Hi, one is High school - also fairly handy.  I would say the three of us spent about 12 hours, across 2 days, pulling out the old shed, and assembling this one. Probably only a couple hours were spent on the old shed, so call it 10 hours. Please bear in mind we had a very solid, level, concrete pad all ready to go. If you need to prepare an area, you will need to factor in that additional time. This seems REALLY important to get a good level base under it. You could do it with 2 people, although that third set of hands was really good to have now and then. 2 people might take a bit longer. It would be a struggle with one person I think.  Shed went up with no real issues. We could do it again in much less time, as we would save the ""figure it out"" portion. The instructions are good. Mostly pictures, with minimal verbiage. Where there is verbiage, PAY ATTENTION to it. All parts bags are labeled, so do not open them until you need them. We spent a fair bit of time cross-referencing parts to make sure we had the right things. We spent a little time fiddling with the door and latch. You'll need screwdrivers, wrenches or sockets. Pliers. A step ladder. A rubber mallet was useful - perhaps not necessary. Once the walls go up (very quickly) if you are in the sun, it can get a little warm in there. There are *alot* of screws, and they recommend not using a screw gun. a side not: A bunch of extra screws. I really appreciate that. IF you loose one, you are not in too much trouble.  The completed shed is very nice. 3 windows (two in front, one in rear which opens). 2 skylights. 2 screened vents. A shelf running the full length of the two short walls (front to back), and 2 corner shelves. You can rearrange where you put the shelves. We found that the steel rails that hold the shelves added to the structural strength of the two side walls, so we put one on each. The steel truss system that holds up the roof is VERY strong. The shed has a somewhat complicated roofline, so there are a bunch of pieces there. You can make the walls bow a bit if you lean into them (perpahs not as bad as mu old steel shed). The aforementioned steel shelving rails help that quite a bit. There are a bunch of other accessories you can buy - shelves, hooks, baskets etc. The door has a spot for a padlock. I' guessing this is more of deterrent, as this is after all a vinyl shed. One door (left) anchors top and bottom with a deadbolt. The other door (right) has the latching mechanism. You only need to open the right door to enter exit the shed. If you open both, you have a very wide opening, for wheelbarrows, snowblowers or the like. There is a page that tells you how to level the shed with shims if the doors are binding.  The shed is not anchored to the ground - although that would not be hard to do. It does have a floor, so once there is a few hundred pounds of assorted garden equipment in there, it is not likely to go anywhere. If you live in an area with really high winds, or you are building it in a really open windy area, on top of a hill or something you might want to take steps.  The door is about 6'4"" in height at the center. The truss system is several inches higher than that, about 6'8"" . Most folks will clear ok, or if not, you may need to duck in the door. The actual roof peak is about 8"". The lowest part of the roof - at the wall is about 6'. Very bright and airy inside. The shed looks very nice - it is light tan, with brown doors and roof.  Had a light rain today. Seems watertight. The rood drainage system is clever.  Very pleased.

I have used Miracle Gro potting soil in the past with good results, but I was feeling too lazy to drive to the home improvement store to buy it, so I ordered on Amazon.  The quality of the soil I received was excellent.  There were very few large pieces and no gnats.  It was easy to scoop out with a pot or a trowel and it holds moisture very well (so make sure your pots have adequate drainage and don't water your plants too often).  The seedlings I transplanted into this soil are thriving thus far.  My past experience with this soil has been that the fertilizers it already contains are good enough for one growing season, at least, so you don't need to add more fertilizer.  Also, if you don't use it all up, it will usually last more than a year in the bag, although opened bags may dry out a bit.  I would caution you to be careful what you're ordering when it comes to package size, since there are many package sizes with many different measurement units available on this page.

I left mine outside on the patio year round with the cover on it.  The cover faded after a few years, then I flipped it inside out.  After a few more years it split open and was exposed.  In the beginning I was spraying tonneau cover protection on the cover.  I didn't keep up with that which is why I got the fading and cracking.  I stopped using the cover this year.  And still get good fires out of it.  However, this fall I've noticed the metal on the bottom deteriorating.  What I didn't read, and maybe it didn't have it back then, was adding sand to the bottom.  That probably would have avoided the metal breakdown.  I did drill a hole in the bottom in the beginning and that helped with any water that entered.  I'm buying a new one and will use sand on the bottom and protect my cover better.  I bet I can get 10 years out of it.

I could not find the specs of this thing anywhere in the description, but so you know, it is 36"" from handle to tip.  You could get up to 32"" of it into the ground, which is pretty deep.  Of course, unless you have full sand or very clean and freshly dumped soil, good luck getting it that far in the ground...  The tube is 5/8"" thick.  If you hit anything hard (read: small rock) while trying to cram this into the ground, then you have to pull it out and try again somewhere else.  The plus side is, you'll be aerating the heck out of your garden.  Also, the hole at the tip is very small...  Which is fine, since it's just for water.  But, get a tiny little pebble in there while you're driving it into the earth, and good luck getting water to come out of it - the hole is plugged!  Carry a small awl or pocket screwdriver with you.  I think your best bet is trying to drive it in while the water is on, using the water pressure to bore the hole.  Problem with that is, this thing can generate a lot of pressure, and depending on what type of soil you're pushing it into, you might be in for a very wet surprise.  I will caution, once you finally do get this thing in the ground, don't turn your water on full blast.  I have no doubt that if you do, it will quickly begin working on creating the next underground cavern below your garden.  The tip does not diffuse the water, so it is a massive water jet (this thing shoots a steady stream a good 40' out of the box, with full water pressure).  One other annoying thing - is the coating.  Not that the coating is bad, it's a very nice powder coat finish. But, remember those rocks and rough soil?  The finish near the tip of mine was worn off after just a few uses, and the now unprotected tip is already rusting like crazy.  A year of use, and I suspect there will be no tip at all, just a rusty piece of 5/8"" tube left.  All in all, it does do the job, but I wouldn't expect this thing to last more than a couple of seasons, unless you have perfect soil (which I apparently do not).","Works okay, but not so impressed",1316995200,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},,know nice hard crazy apparently find drive rock use create wet like drive steady caution heck depend earth could near come fine might try perfect think underground generate job garden next last get luck thing certainly expect stream pebble problem tip sand already description clean begin mine surprise well deep read handle box leave thick shoot little somewhere finish coat course freshly one lot blast turn annoy cram rough pull aerate far try plug good hole type soil quickly worn couple rock suspect full remember bet dump bad also coat pressure season powder finally water ground hit else jet rusty side screwdriver spec bore cavern plus unprotected massive piece since pocket best anywhere work doubt awl rust dude tube unless tiny use push year diffuse get carry anything use small pretty

1717,251567,5,8.0,False,"01 16, 2010",A2950ARZ8S1M6D,B001I7JWTO,Gerald Bailey,"I pack the early snow on my gravel driveway by driving on the snow intentionally. Six inches of snow packs down to maybe one inch of packed snow (one inch of water equals about ten inches of snow). With a packed snow layer over my driveway gravel the Wovel glides easier and I do not worry about my gasoline snowblower throwing a rock. And up here the ground freezes down to about 4 feet for most of winter, which means the surface seldom melts into slick ice.  My gasoline snowblower is used only for really deep snow. Here in the badlands of North Dakota the day after a storm the wind is almost always still blowing. My driveway is on the normally downwind side of my house and the wind swirls around the house for the first third of my 90 foot driveway. On a nice sunny winter day I come in after using the gasoline snowthrower covered with snow from head to foot. On the brightest sunny day a jacket with hood is needed to keep snow out of ones hair.  So, of my manual snow toys, why does my Wovel get the most use? I am retired, have a bad back, and I make a hobby out of moving snow in the winter. I usually have time to plan when it must be done. Because the wovel can do everything well and throws snow up in piles the best, or on top of a snowbank the best (like when you have one or two feet of snow on both sides of your driveway).  The Garant Poly Sleigh and Suncast Big Scoop are best for moving large amounts of snow some distance, easily over level packed snow, and dumping that snow in a place that is almost level, by tipping it up on end. So I would only have one of those, if the snow always melted between snows so I had a level place to dump. But I usually end up with snow piled at least one or two feet tall on both sides of driveway between storms at some point. The Garant poly sleigh has a longer handle that angles up giving the user an extra way to grip it. Most important to those of us with bad backs is that it can be angled back and pushed up onto six or eight inches of snow at sides of driveway without hardly bending over. A light jerk moves the snow off of it. Not as easy as tipping it up on end on level ground but not difficult. Tipping up on the back slightly before jerking backwards makes it even easier. But the dumping part is where the wovel really shines. It can toss snow further back, and on top of a higher embankment, for a higher thicker pile each side of driveway.  The wind can blow often up here. Sometimes I will wake up to see a snowdrift across my driveway perhaps 6 foot wide and 10 inches deep tapering off to nothing at the other side of the driveway. Usually my Wovel or my Suncast Big Scoop can deal with it faster than warming up the gasoline snowblower. If the downwind side of driveway has at least a foot of snow on it the Wovel can throw the snow up on the bank faster than any other hand powered method I have found without lifting a shovel. Often I find myself using the Suncast Big Scoop then finishing up with the Wovel later when time permits (widening the driveway back to where it was by throwing the newer snow up on the older snow). If I had planned ahead and used my snowblower to give my driveway extra width the Suncast Big Scoop would do fine, dumping driveway snow at the edges until it gets narrow again. Unfortunately I constantly find my winter driveway getting narrower.  If a storm drops 8 inches of snow and it is ignored, and another 8 inches comes in before it melts, (last winter two storms of a foot and a half each overlapped) then one must have a very short driveway or a gasoline snowblower, or be young with energy to burn. Or in my little town you call city hall and for ten dollars (added to water bill) they will send out the maintenance man with a snowplow, when he gets time. After storms he is really busy.  I use a steel garden shovel to break up packed snow, like the berm at end of driveway left by the county snowplow. It is only a steel shovel problem when I have been driving over it a few days while it grows. If I promptly move it with the Wovel before driving over it the wovel does fine. If I need to break it up with the shovel then the Big Scoop also works fine. The long handled flat bladed utility shovels (shaped like coal shovels)works best for me.  I use my Wovel with the ice blade most often for smoothing out the lumps in the snow packed over my gravel driveway, where my tires run most often. And I am finding more uses for the ice blade now that I am leaving it on one wovel and the gravel wheels on the other. The ice blade is flat enough to give support similar to the gravel wheels. Without either the shovel head tends to dive toward gravel when full of snow.  Every time one uses these things some new simple thing is discovered. Like jabbing the end of Wovels shovel into the snowbank to keep it upright in the wind, or doing the same with the Big Scoop keeps it upright so one does not need to bend over to reach down for the handle.",My favorite hand tool for snow,1263600000,{'Size:': ' Folding'},,snow equal snowbank angled maybe snowdrift onto dollar hall upright drive wide melt slick toy inch fine one young last tall sleigh get county thing blow later steel blade seldom berm overlap warm bend really bill part point badlands easy jacket city energy high almost across find smooth would method gasoline everything melt bad ahead work water easily difficult shine either jerk pile constantly two without power wake shape do backwards every amount driveway give send house embankment move utility rock tire like extra garant level come usually shovel toward garden angle normally nothing problem brightest cover gravel deep storm burn long narrower unfortunately drop shovels)works one promptly new add bladed scoop day first suncast ten time lift call handle top give dive also dump still see edge widen user ice side reach sunny intentionally layer wind run new hood toss permit throw use always support nice hand use head break long wheel jab storm pile need half least grows important enough big slightly leave third mean must eight found leave packed faster little thing swirl back back discover deal place snow pack distance wovels pile similar foot pack manual maintenance use side bank come early perhaps glide thicker sometimes throws plan bend man make move snowthrower shovel best move often retire lumps well another get blow foot find way coal surface six poly tends inch simple tip freezes handle jerk need dump finish hair snowplow dakota snowblower large hardly light full wovel downwind narrow town winter even grind easy taper day north plan short push width around ignored worry keep end make flat get busy throw old use hobby keep grip

The blackberry bushes around here will absolutely take over if you don't keep them in check.  That was the main purpose for buying this trimmer.  I chose the DeWalt because I have several of their cordless tools already and the batteries are compatible.  Right out of the package this thing was ready to go.  Add charged battery, remove blade cover, annihilate blackberry bushes.  It easily cut through the very tough runners, some over 3/4"" thick.  Then it was just a matter of raking up the debris and throwing it on the burn pile.  This tool probably isn't the lightest but it's easily manageable.  The blades are razor sharp and it's long enough to reach some harder-to-get areas.  I ran it for over 40 minutes and didn't notice a decrease in the battery power.  Not having an electrical cord gives me the freedom to carry this tool all over the 10 acre property.  The fit and finish of the tool is typically DeWalt...perfect.

I mention below that I have pictures, I'll try to add those pictures when it becomes possible to do so.  It took me a while to research this product before I wrote a review.  I've actually never owned lawn furniture this nice before.  I had some cheap stuff that I bought ""somewhere"" for $100.  I have used many other peoples lawn furniture, and even eaten at some restaurants which used lawn furniture outside.  I've borrowed other people's lawn furniture when i was having a party.  To me, lawn furniture is a big investment even if its $500.  This Strathwood set has some really great aspects, and one poor one: the table.  But I'm going to start off by talking about everything else but the table.  Comfort:  the chairs are very comfortable.  I like them, and I use them a lot now.  The pillows I don't like so much.  They seem small and very very puffy.  Sure, they should flatten out over time.  But the pillows are actually too small for my liking.  If you put the pillows up against the arm of the chair they try to squeeze underneath the arm of the chair.  This is because they are so puffy and small.  They seem smaller than the ones in the picture on the website.  But overall the chairs are very comfortable and very nice.  Style:  I don't like the grey color that much.  The pillows add a splash of color, and the grey hides the dirt well.  But after several weeks the grey just looks bland.  Maybe a taupe color would have been better.  Durability:  I abused the set a little.  I left the cushions out in the rain on purpose.  They drained out the water very nicely and dried quickly.  That was good.  Speaking of durability, you aren't supposed to leave the cushions out in severe weather.  I bought a patio box to keep them in:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suncast-DBW9200-Mocha-Wicker-Resin-Deck-Box-99-Gallon/dp/B0044V3USU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suncast DBW9200 Mocha Wicker Resin Deck Box, 99-Gallon</a>&nbsp;That box is actually a bit too small, something bigger would have been better.  But it was within my budget and its a great box, so we cram the cushions in anyway (they fit in the linked suncast box if you cram them in).  Quality: The set is very lightweight and sturdy, and easy to move.  But sometimes the plastic bits that are on the ends of the legs want to come out.  But eventually they they will go between the boards on my deck into ""the black abyss"" below.  Material: Water beads up on the material very easily.  I'm uploading a photo of how easy it was to spray them with a light water mist to remove the pollen thats been coating everything lately.  Packaging: the item arrived undamaged.  It came in one huge box, which was delivered in a panel truck (NOT UPS!).  The box is too big to fit through most doorways.  It barely fit through the gate that leads to my backyard.  I've already told you that the table is my biggest complaint.  So its time for me to come clean about that.  There are notable product flaws on the table, and, worse, it looks like someone ineptly tried to cover them up.  First, on 3 of 4 legs the leveling screw was screwed in so tight it bent the metal above it.  I'm talking about the screw that you can move in and out to keep the table from being wobbly (floors can be uneven).  Mine were screwed in so tight that they dented the metal on the other side of the leg. Second, on the top of the table there were some dents.  These were from the 8 screws that hold the legs on.  Once again, someone had screwed them in so tightly that they damaged the metal on the other side (this would be the top of the table in plain sight).  To fix these blemishes, someone just took a can of spray paint and spritzed a round shiny spot of spray paint that is really obvious.  So its not that the problem went unnoticed.  Then the table was disassembled and sent to me pre-dented.  I'm very disappointed about the botched touch up paint, but there would be dents either way.  I also don't like the table design, there is a lot of pollen right now and the pollen gets in the track around the glass, so you have to remove the glass to clean this area.  To me, this is a safety issue even if the glass is tempered (it is).  If you want your table to look clean you will have to regularly remove the glass.  I don't have this problem with my other glass outdoor table.  Overall, this is a really nice set.  We are spending more time outside because of it, which is great.  We're using it for both lunch and dinner because the weather is so beautiful right now.  We had guests over Easter weekend who complimented the set and asked where they could buy it.  They didn't notice the problems with the table, but they also weren't really looking.  I really like the set.  If it weren't for the quality problems on the table I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.  Amazon stands behind its products 100%, and included a card that says you can return or exchange anything at no cost.  So big props to them for being so upstanding.  If you are on the brink of purchasing this then I would give it a try.

THE FACTS: I live in Miami Florida and yes it is hot here in the summer however my pool has a lot of landscape and palms around it which provides shade to about 2/3 of the pool so my pool water rarely gets to the desirable temperature it normally stays between 82 to 85 in the summer while the temperature outside is 91 to 95. we like the water in between 88 and 90 especially those days when we use it in the evening and into the night.  THE PROCESS: My pool holds about 12,000 gals of water so as per their chart I needed two boxes (4 panels) but I went ahead and ordered 3 boxes (6 panels). I installed it myself with the help of my two sons and took us a few hours. I ran the piping myself as well. at the first try it didn't work - there was too much pressure on the pump and there was not enough flow to run the jets so I contacted the Company directly (Smart pool) and this is the part that gets really good.  THE COMPANY: Their customer service was great; it exceeded my expectations. They took all the necessary time on the phone to review the installation I had done, the layout, etc. we even traded pictures over the email so they consulted with their experts and came back with recommendations including changing the configuration of the piping connecting to the pool pump and worked with me all the way through until it was resolved. Kudos to this company for their superb Customer Service.  THE PRODUCT: I am Completely satisfied with this product. it is a great invention and works well - easy to install.

Not to mention MEK or even real Berrymans.  But enough. My property was until recently littered with seasonal sprayers- Home Depot $9.99 models which despite proper maintenance and care can become relatively unusable after a few years. Spare parts? Forget it. I recently got one for my hardwood floors, and despite attention to cleaning, its already in the heap.  Surpassing event he finest Hudson sprayers I have used, the  is built of the highest quality materials I have seen in a sprayer- brass and stainless and almost no plastic.  The nozzle is solid brass, and instead of the valve being in the handle as with all the typical sprayers, this one seats a brass plug against a Teflon washer between the threaded end of the wand and the nozzle. I was somewhat stymied by the order of assembly, the illustration in the manual is extremely tiny, and applies to several other models as well, and very difficult to discern what was really going on. As it turns out, the correct valve seal was not included in the package. A quick call to Customer Service and I had the part in 3 days, including a much more detailed drawing, (which, when I post it you will also see illustrates that the wand must be attached to the hose with Teflon tape) assembling them immediately became a doh moment and I was on my way. I may have heard wrong, but it may be that this model usually ships assembled and mine was not.  The Amazon product page shows two nozzles which are presumably included, but not in the kit I received- I am not sure what is actually correct, you may wish to check before purchasing. It throws a cone shape, while for most purposes I tend to prefer a flat pattern. But, all parts are available instantly from the manufacturer, again, thanks to their excellent customer service and tech support staff.  The one thing I don't like about the valve being in the nozzle end means the tank has to be depressurized before any adjustments to the nozzle may be made, or even a nozzle change performed. Its a relatively small price to pay for the quality of this valve arrangement, just a new procedure for me.  The pump takes few strokes to well pressurize the tank, so its a fair trade. It seals well against the tank, and I quickly got used to the additional capacity. A built-in drip tray serves as a base for the unit, you can clip the wand into a hook on the side of the tank then tuck the tip into its own drip pan, although properly assembled there has been very little dripping.  A bit bulkier (and pricier) than the average DIYer may be used to, but the quality and performance certainly blow everything else away.","More than a sprayer, its a beaut.

Sadly, I've never been a good meat-cooker guy - I've seen the look of disappointment in my childrens' eyes.  Most things I cook on my gas bbq grill turn out disappointing - especially ribs (which me and my kids love).  Enter this smoker.  I bought some ribs (babyback), I read the smoker instructions, I read some internet instructions and recipes, I dry-rubbed, put in the smoker @ 250 degrees temp (using 2-2-1 internet tip - 2 hours on smoker bare rack, 2 hours in foil back in smoker, 1 hour back out of foil to firm up - spritz with apple juice once per hour).  My first batch of ribs turned out delish - best I've ever done and it was easy in the smoker. Since then I've been smokin' some meats 1-2x per week and probably will continue to do so until the day I die (hopefully not of clogged arteries/ cardiac arrest).  Things I noted about this product:   -Just to be clear you do no use this indoors - this is used outdoors and instructions say use at least several feet from any roofline - not alot of smoke comes out but a little does (which permeates my yard and my neighbors yards with the delish smell of smoking meat) - afterwards I smell like I was just eating in a bbq joint which I consider an extra bonus.   -This smoker is electric.  It plugs into a electric outlet.   -Instructions advise you need to preheat the smoker eat time (at PH setting).  This takes 40 minutes.  So smoking meat is not quick - 40 minutes preheat + 3 hours + for meat = start early if you kids want meat for dinner.  The smoker has simple digital readout controls including a timer you can set so it shuts off when that time is reached.   -Size is about like a dorm fridge.  4 metal grated racks in it.  Small wheels in back which allow you to tip and roll but for me it's just easier to pickup and carry the smoker which is a bit heavy but doable (provided I don't throw my back out).  Good build quality - appears like it should last at least a couple of years (I will update my review if it doesn't).  Overall, a game changer for me - I can finally cook some decent ribs (and if I can that means you can too).  At current price of $250 I think this CharBroil is a good value vs other options I've seen out there.

Wrap the string around 8 or more times for strength.   You should get string, (4) 5 gallon paint stirrers, and a string level to level the ground.  The paint stirrers are free at the hardware store, the level is a buck.  Use the paint stirrers as stakes.  Run the string as a rectangle around the stakes.  Use the string level to level the string.  Get the ground as level as you can using shovels, rakes, and hoes.  Then wet it down with the hose.  This will compact the lose dirt and the water will flow and pool in the low areas. You can high pressure spray the high points.  They will turn to mud and flow to the low parts.

Many years ago, before I discovered Earthboxes, I purchased a couple of simiar, but different planters from another source.  Those original planters used a heavy capillary mat to wick water into the soil.  The capilary mat support eventually collapsed, but the planters are still being used today by my neighbor.  I rigged up a support by poking holes in an inverted inexpensive litter tray and placing a brick under the center to support the weight of the soil and plants.  I've found Earthboxes to be superior to those original planters and would be lost in our hot, unforgiving summers without them.  Although I have a few raised beds, they never produce as well as veggies I grow in earthboxes. We still have many of the older ones without casters that are difficult to move, but the newer ones with casters are a dream come true.  Now I can roll the maters under some shelter from the scorching sun or position plants as needed to assist nature.  Being able to fill the reservior instead of time-consuming, labor intesive watering duty cuts down on stress the plants experience and saves me time. Not having to weed endlessly makes gardening a pleasure. My neighbor and I have both found many methods to replace the elastic covers instead of endlessly purchasing them. You can purchase dolomite or lime from any garden center, look for deals on good granular plant food and use trash bags or other methods to cover the planters when the covers wear out. The planters keep right on going, year after year. Periodically replacing or refreshing the potting soil is beneficial, but aside from the original purchase, the cost of gardening with them goes down over time.  The fact that it makes it easier and more pleasant to grow more of your own fresh veggies is reason enough to consider them.  Some people build supports to hold them off the ground making it easier to tend.  Note on homemade EBs.  Been there, done that.  Several years ago, we put together quite a few homemade earthboxes using instructions on the internet.  We used large tote boxes and they worked fine for a couple of seasons. The materials just don't hold up.  After a couple of years of baking in the sun, they began to crack if you tried to move them.  Then they would crack or crumble if you bumped them.  We had to toss all of the homemade EBs and clean up the mess.  They were cheaper than purchasing new EBs, but not so cheap in the long run because they don't last. Some of my earthboxes are quite a few years old and holding up just fine.

My prior edger started bending at the neck, so I retired it before it decided to break and injure me somehow.  This edger seems to feel substantially solid with the metal going up pretty far up the handle.  The round handle looks interesting.  In use, it is really easy to grip comfortably.  I may have to retire my d-handle shovels and try out these o-handles instead.  My old edger just had a long handle, and that often left blisters even after short use.

2208,582753,3,24.0,False,"12 14, 2014",A2M9ME0N2S3R39,B00N8PQCE2,Steven G.,"My home has a very large yard with many trees. Owning a Stihl chainsaw as well as an electric Remington Pole saw, I have some experience with these devices. At first I was excited about this chainsaw, since a 40v battery, light weight and tool less operation with a simple on button sounds great, except, the battery does not hold up, and the chainsaw itself is just too light to cut easily through thick wood.  The experience cutting wood - Filling up the reservoir has a little strainer I had to remove since the chain lubricant was to thick to run easily through. - My first cutting test was a big ambitious. I cut a big 8 inch log of dense elm wood into three chunks. The chainsaw had some problem keeping up, and at some point I was worried it would just burn out because of the noise. After this cut, the battery was down to 50%. Good thing I did not plan to cut the whole tree. - Next I cut some 2-3 inch thick branches, mostly basswood and ash, 10 cuts. Remaining battery life: 25% - The reservoir was almost empty after basically 5-10 minutes of continuous cutting.  Safety and operation - The kickback safety protector that is supposed to shut down the chainsaw when there is a kickback is fake plastic. Why they made a plastic mold I don't know except to make it look like a pro-unit - The metal hooks that usually are in front of most gas powered chainsaws was some plastic ribbed mold. Again marketing, since this had NO use. - It was easy to unscrew the compartment to adjust tension and clean. - It is possible to operate this chainsaw in ANY position, I tried upside down, I even cut vertical a full branch of a tree. Not very safe or recommended even. - The unit is very light in comparison to a gas powered 12"",  I could cut hours with this, except the battery would die in 15 minutes. Two batteries would have been better and optimal. - Charging the battery and checking how much power is left is a great feature. There is a button that you can push that shows immediately if you have 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% or 0% left.  Packaging: The box contains a fully assembled chainsaw with a partial charged battery. The manual states that some parts need to be assembled, but not the version I got. It was fully assembled. What is missing in the box is lubricant for the chainsaw. while going through the manual, I could not find much about this, good thing I had some from my Stihl I used.  Bottom line This is a good chainsaw for home owners who have to cut small 2-4 inch branches from a few trees. If however you plan to do a lot of cutting, remove trees, or tackle anything big, you may want to consider getting additional batteries, or just get a cheap gas powered chainsaw.","Light, compact, but underpowered",1418515200,{'Style:': ' Includes 40V Battery'},,know kickback plastic power much additional use find branch package button pole fake excited feature like immediately log however hour cut could need usually branch tree yard upside state hold battery next unit get many thing marketing inch owner big problem recommend great test simple device minute continuous clean contains chainsaw good burn less partial basswood remain shut compartment leave box thick little safe line pro-unit keep tool fill position optimal push miss stihl lot operate lubricant make possible electric whole cut point remington elm go manual sound home good strainer consider operation large tree use charge first light want weight almost chainsaws full fully version safety cheap owning empty get would metal mostly reservoir part worry vertical tackle suppose assemble even plan easy easily mold front remove basically except bottom wood ambitious ash rib check gas dense make experience show unscrew cut since saw die two chunk try powered look tension run life battery noise comparison adjust well get three charge may anything protector hook small chain

The Entire Palm, Back Knuckle and Fingertip Sections are made of Super Soft but Durable Goat Leather which helps protect hands from scratches and scrapes when working in the garden or backyard. They offer a 3"" Wide Lined, 100% Cotton Outer Cuff which helps prevent dirt from getting inside the gloves when re-potting plants. The Palm Side of this cuff features a 3"" x 3/4"" Leather Reinforcement Strip for additional protection to the inner wrist. The portions Between the Fingers feature a Leather Panel which is securely stitched to the top and bottom sections which not only offer flexibility, but added protection as well. The Tops of the Finger and Wrist areas are also made of 100% Cotton, with the exception of the Leather Knuckle and Fingertip areas. The Upper Wrist Section is gathered and sewn to an Elastic Band which helps keep out dirt, shape the glove and improve the fit. For the purpose of this review I took the time to turn one of the gloves inside out and discovered that the entire palm area is lined with a 55% Terylene / 45% Cotton fabric that is super soft and comfortable against the skin. Each Inner Finger on the Palm Side also offers a strip of this fabric to increase the comfort, as well as add another layer of protection. On the downside, this lining is not hemmed and the finger portions, while cut from the same piece of lining as the palm section, are only stitched to the glove at the fingertips, so I am unsure as to how long they will stay in position with time.  As the Overall Quality of these gloves is Very Good, I did not feel this was reason enough to deduct a full star from my review. Zeemplify included 6 Plastic T-Type Plant Markers, as well as took the time to email a very informative Gardening E-Book, ""The Beginners Guide to Successful Gardening"".  They shipped quickly and offered excellent order followup. I received my Leather Gardening Gloves by Zeemplify at a discounted price in exchange for testing and review, and while my hands are a size small, I ordered the Medium so I could gift them to my sister who has a much bigger garden than I do.

The battery current doesn't seem to be any interpretable quantity, seeming to be the absolute value of the battery current plus the load current, or something equally weird.  You want the plus or minus battery charge current, which is not what it gives, so you can tell if the solar array is staying ahead of the load or not.  (You can tell this indirectly by watching the battery voltage, which does work.  The battery voltage takes a familiar course over the day as the controller goes through its charging schedule, unless a competing load prevents it.)  You also discover that the controller temperature is not anywhere near the battery temperature, so you need the remote temperature sensor for the controller.  You might have thought not, but the controller generates some heat when the solar voltage has to be downconverted, so the temperatures differ even if they're located next to each other.

However for me to know whether the product actually makes a difference I would have to test it over a longer period of time.

One thing I learned is to adjust the head so I make square cuts to avoid any hang up from the branch starting to fall and binding the blades.  Used this to trim limbs over my electric pasture fence while driving my tractor so my Tractor ROPS bar now clears the limbs. If the jaws fit around a limb you can cut it without a terrible amount of strength.  I bought this to trim some tall hedge bushes along the edge of my yard and it worked well for trimming the tall tops.  Have used the saw (3 inch limbs) and it cuts fine if you let it do the cutting and take your time.  Used it to cut some woody stemed large weeds on hard to navigate banks too.

I'm going to tell you what I don't like first, because there's just a couple things I don't like.  Those things might be deal-breakers for some people.  The electronics on this smoker are sketchy, meaning the control panel would sometimes just blink out when I was adjusting the temperature or time settings.  I played with the controls for a while, plugged and unplugged the smoker, and then it started working.  The remote control sometimes turned the unit off when I pushed a button, too.  I sat with the smoker for about 3 of 4 hours while smoking a beef brisket, and the smoker controls never missed a beat thereafter.  The next thing I don't like is having to put pellets (preferred) or chips into the smoker tube every 45 minutes to an hour.  That's ridiculous.  I have a great solution -- use at your own risk -- to defeat this problem.  More on that later.  I also wish the temperature setting would go up to 300 deg F instead of 275 deg F.  The last thing is getting a smoker with glass in front is a waste of time and money and just another thing to worry about if the seal went bad or the glass got broken, in my opinion, of course.  The glass smokes and smudges up so badly so quickly that I wish I had just gotten a 40 inch smoker with no window.  Yes, I know I can clean the glass every time with some white vinegar.  Ok, now to the good.  I love the fact that this unit can be used with a cold smoker.  It has made some fantastic smoked cheese for me in about 2 hours.  I like the fact that the thermostat kicks the unit's heating element back on when the temperature falls 2-3 degrees below the target temperature.  I like all the drip pans and trays.  I like the built in meat probe, altho I bought a separate aftermarket wireless meat probe just to keep the Masterbuilt probe honest.  There is about 9 deg F difference between the 2 probes so far.  I like the fact that this unit is electric, so I don't have to worry (I hope) about it not continuing to heat (compared to running out of propane), unless the power goes out for some reason.  It is rated at 10A @ 120VAC, so be prepared to use some juice while this unit is heating up.  The cold smoke is rated at 1.5A @ 120VAC, as a side note, but you should not be running them both together at the same time UNLESS you want to try something I have done *at your own risk*:  I bought a 6 inch and a 12 inch smoking cube.  I don't care what brand you buy.  I bought what was cheapest while still earning good reviews.  So I don't have to babysit this smoker every 45 minutes to an hour and add pellets, I light up the 6 inch cube for 2 hours smoke, or I light up the 12 inch cube for about 4 hours smoke.  They work very well, and they are pretty consistent for the 2 and 4 hours durations.  I am even thinking about buying a couple more tubes to have them loaded up and ready to light for longer smoking projects.  The only problem I can see with using the cubes is I have to open the door to replace the cubes, and that lets some of the heat and smoke out, but these cubes produce their own heat (helps with the maintaining of internal temp) and smoke so quickly that it really doesn't matter.  The other thing I have done is to shoot smoke in from the cold smoker into the main body of the smoker and not use the chip/pellet tube at all.  The heating element in the smoker itself will heat up the insides, and the cold smoker outside produces the smoke up to about 6 hours has been my experience so far.  Again, do so at your own risk.  I did not have good results using the smoker outside in the wind in cold weather.  Again, do this at your own risk:  I put my smoker right inside the door of the garage so it's protected from the wind on 3 sides (I have machine shed type doors that slide side to side, not up and down), and I opened the door a bit to let the smoke out and some cold air in.  That helps quite a bit.  If I had to do it all over again, I would not buy the 40 incher with the glass front.  I would get the 40 inch with the simplest and most reliable controls as well.  I would also make sure the smoker allows for the addition of the cold smoker.  This is a must, in my opinion.  The cold smoker is soooo great for smoking cheese.","A pretty good unit, but spend less money and buy a Masterbuilt 40 inch without the glass front - 4 stars",1512604800,"{'Size:': ' 40 Inch', 'Color:': ' Stainless', 'Style:': ' Top Controller/Window'}",,think power go heat cold try sketchy last turn maintain get badly thing buying sure later electronics really beef beat tell control degree right panel let far earn yes type quickly couple cube ready hour target bit deal-breakers let would babysit bad juice reliable propane pan experience main continue broken build run door overall seal device risk go do note every aftermarket wish know cheap door remote button drip like element shoot start solution chip/pellet might vinegar open open prepare problem money ok hope love make meat electric help plug load first time unplugged buy also still see inside side wind tube allow there's slide use adjust fall produce play use work longer probe probe duration hour sit cheese thereafter next unit masterbuilt soooo must go smoker brand thing course shed cube prefer back waste tube kick separate good setting use side altho pellet get blink white sometimes wireless produce front chip garage ridiculous deg smoke buy make unit's window i'm work smoke body defeat setting heat well another smoke difference unless care control incher air quite insides result add glass meaning simple consistent inch thermostat something great addition minute project clean put protected that's fact replace tray compare reason go together outside machine temp want light smudge fantastic miss honest even temperature matter opinion smoke never push brisket review get worry instead rat weather people get internal keep pretty

I was pleasantly surprised to find that it performed wonderfully and worked as well if not better than I had dared hope.  A couple things to point out about this unit, which set it apart from some of the other, less desirable options out there (Orbit, or if you want, Ray Padula is the same unit as Orbit for twice the price). First and foremost, unlike the competitors, this unit from Melnor is made in Taiwan, as opposed to PRC/China. For anyone that's handled product from the former, you will not be surprised to find that it far exceeds the quality of the latter. Secondly, build quality is very good, even for plastic. It feels like good, higher density plastic and not just cheap/junk plastic that you'd expect from most Asian manufacturing. I was pleasantly surprised by this. Third, if you compare with other units, you'll see that only this Melnor one has the full hex bolstering around the hose connection. Competitors like Orbit have a much weaker connection with ridges rather than full on hex flats, and are not as strong. This is where you'll put the most stress on the unit, so beefier is definitely better. Melnor got this right where the others clearly opted to go cheaper.  Another nice feature that this unit has is the adjuster on the top. It actually does work and gives you what I would call some fine tuning of the flow rate at the unit, as opposed to having to do it all from the hose bib/spigot. And no, you cannot completely shut the unit off with this adjustment knob, it basically gives you a range from low to high. I probably would have preferred a unit with no moving parts, but in this case, build quality is good, you don't get leaks at the knob or anywhere else.  Overall, a very nice unit that I'm happy to have. I ended up combining this with the Gardena quick disconnects that I use for my watering and it works like a dream. Highly recommended if you're looking for a bubbler of this type. In retrospect, I'd still prefer Taiwan-made plastic unit over any of the Chinese metal ones.

It includes a tiny air plant, three different colors of moss, a branched stick, a sea urchin shell, sand, a thin glass terrarium globe that looks like a tipped brandy snifter, and a set of instructions.  The components come wrapped in tissue paper or bubble wrap, but loose in the box so you may have to hunt for them.  (There isn't a single, giftable box containing everything.)  Except for the pedestal portion, the glass is extremely thin and therefore fragile.  From base to top, it measures about 5"".  Assembly took about ten minutes and is easier if you use tweezers, although fingers are fine.  All you do is dump the sand in the bottom and arrange the rest according to your preferences.  The air plant must be submerged in water before adding.  You'll have to water the plant in this way about once a week, so make sure you can remove it without disturbing the rest.  I placed mine on top of the sea urchin hole, as per the product photo, and the base of the plant is a little too big (or the sea urchin too small) for a perfect fit, which means its more balanced there than inside.  This makes a unique and beautiful gift, although you'll have to find a small box that will fit everything because it doesn't come in any form that is truly gift-able, something I hope the company will rectify in the future.

The pros: + Reasonable cost of $44.85, with free shipping when I bought mine. + Pretty good customer product reviews. + Fiberglass poles with an easy to use ""quick release lock"". + Advertised - Ideal for cutting high branches without climbing a ladder. + Advertised - Product Dimensions 3 x 8 x 88 inches - pole extends up to 14 feet. + Advertised - Power-Lever technology maximizes leverage to give you up to two times more cutting power than traditional tree pruners. + Advertised - Included 15 inch WoodZig saw blade. + Advertised - Pruner blade - 1-1/2 inch diameter cutting capacity. + Advertised - Item Weight 5.8 pounds. + Advertised - Lifetime warranty. + Advertised - Origin USA.

Also as an added bonus I liked was that the school was full of string already so I didn't have to fill it up with my own. So once the spool was installed I begin to use my weed eater to weed eat my yard and it held up really well just like I knew it would.

The coco fibers are embedded into a rubber base with plenty of drainage space for water to pass through. Construction seems very good - gave it a good workout when it arrived, and the fibers stayed put. Also, like the fact that the rubber is recycled. The product is made in India.  I've used coco fiber mats before as outdoor mats and, while they did a great job in getting the muck off your shoes before entry, they tended to disintegrate due to rain/snow/sun. I had switched to an all-rubber mat which has held up well, but it doesn't do a good job of cleaning shoes. This mat seems to blend the best of both worlds - coco fibers to clean, and a rubber base that will hold up to the weather.  My only quibble is that it's rather lightweight - a stiff wind would probably move it about. It would be better if it had a thicker base to add more weight and resistance to the wind.

Any review for this product that says it did not work simply means it did not work on the type of algae that one person had (which may not be your own problem).  It means they have a fundamental misunderstanding of how many types of algae there is, and other problems that cloud or muddy your pond.  I ran a very careful test over the past 30 days.  My pond is about 6K liters (2K gallons).  I use a Little Giant 1hp pump 24/7 with a 2 meter raise (about 6 feet).  This goes into a standard 55gal barrel filed with Air Conditioning batting to collect the heavy particles.  This goes over to another barrel that is empty, but closed, which has a 55 watt UV.  I turned this off for the test.  But I did stick a kilo (2 pounds) of barley hey in there.  Temp is about 20c (70f)  Using the 1.89l (64 oz) Algaefix, ever few days I would splash a little into the water fall.  I find this works much better than shocking the system.  My water went from pea green thick to clear enough to see a dime on the floor of the deepest part (about 1 meter (3 feet)).  So recap, in my pond, 2K needed about 2liters or 1 liter  per 1K liters.  Since I did this slowly, I was able to see how fast the water cleared.  At this point, my GUESS is that to maintain the pond would require 2 liters every 3 months.  Hope this helps clear up your understanding of this product, and your pond as well.

2700,427867,3,51.0,True,"12 9, 2014",A1RSTON1MRXW0,B008UCCCII,Neb,"I'm familiar with the GH Flora trio and have had great results with it. So I decided to try to give this performance pack a try. After using it for part of the grow, the only real difference I noticed was my plants were easier to burn, and it took me way longer to measure out my nutrients with all the extra supplements. Plus it became obvious that the supplements won't even last a full grow.  So I stopped with the extras and now I'm just using the Flora Series trio again, plus CaliMagic (since I'm growing in coco coir). At this point, the package has been an interesting experiment but I wouldn't recommend it to any other growers, especially beginners! It's just more things that could possibly mess you up.  Pros - Get base nutrients plus a lot of extras - The Flora series trio (included in this kit) is AMAZING for growing big top-quality fruit, and I think a lot of growers will see benefits by switching over. If this kit gets people to the Flora trio series, then it has done some good in the world for growers :) - You get a lot of different bottles, which can be cool if you want to try them out - Cute, well-packaged box  Problems - No pH Up / pH Down, so you have to but those separately - No CaliMagic, which is a very common nutrient supplement, so you may have to buy a bottle of that separately - Doesn't contain enough of each supplement for a full grow. Several items will run out if you use them as advertised, and you'll have to replace some of the items to get to harvest. It makes me think this kit is just a vehicle for General Hydroponics to sell more nutrients and supplements - this seems like a complete kit but you'll end up having to buy several other things to finish your grow. - Too many bottles/things to add every time you make water for your plants, it ends up adding a lot of extra time compared to giving just nutrients - The Flora trio (the base nutrient trio) already gives your plants literally everything they need. I've used it for years now. I usually give the Flora trio at half-strength, with plain water every other watering. That seems to work really well. But adding all these supplements makes it super easy to burn your plant, and you'll need to give plain water even more often, or reduce the nutrient strength even further to use all of them. You don't want nutrient burn all over your leaves and fruit! That's what will happen if you use this kit at their recommended levels. So if you do get it, make sure to use way less than they recommend, and give plain water every other time.  If you're not sure what nutrients to get, get the plain General Hydroponics Flora trio in the big bottles! You don't need all these other supplements. The trio is all you need to make it to the end of your grow with smelly, tasty, huge dense fruit. I also recommend adding CaliMagic if growing in coco coir, if you have soft water, or are using RO water. Make sure to test and adjust the pH throughout the grow! Test the runoff too. If you do just those things with the Flora trio, I guarantee you'll end up with the same or better results than you would using this kit with all the unnecessary supplements. Just my opinion! In any case, I've stopped using the extra stuff and gone back to just the trio. My plants are happier than ever :)",You end up with the same or better results using the plain Flora nutrient trio without all the supplements,1418083200,,,give measure base use i've performance work fruit longer way like result ever mess harvest extra recommend trio could add need usually bottle top-quality try grow think world advertise coir last cute problem plant soft get calimagic pro several many enough hydroponics seem recommended big ph benefit great sure test beginner already sell different amaze possibly real good burn less interesting box huge thing grow finish nutrient water really half-strength that's obvious include bottles/things runoff part replace series package lot go flora stop back point compare leave pack easy good vehicle give take coco add use ro reduce item super unnecessary stuff want full cool separately decide time especially common would give happy everything familiar buy level plant extras general supplement also switch bottle strength experiment end complete literally even see water become grower easy smelly year opinion plain dense contain make guarantee case plus i'm since often nutrient run throughout end make kit people happen adjust use gh well-packaged well get difference do notice every may tasty supplement

I've tried a bunch of different expanding hoses in the past, with varying levels of success, and some immediate failures.  This brand appears to have found the winning formula---I have the 100ft, 75ft, and 50ft lengths, and they're all good.  They've clearly used heavy-duty materials, and they haven't cut corners like the inferior models you can buy for a fraction of the price on Amazon.  Don't make the mistake I did initially and go for a cheap, lightweight model---they crap out almost immediately.  This one is pricey--but you have to think in terms of cost-per-use.  The expensive one that lasts longer is more economical than one that bursts right away and need constant replacing.  This is definitely not featherweight---and that's a good thing.  I weighed this hose, and it's 4.5lbs.  That's heavy for an expanding hose.  But that's because they've used better materials:  heavy brass, thick woven material, and reinforced latex.  What I wish I'd known the first time around was how to tell the good hoses from the bad ones: ----They have brass fittings.  (The bad ones are plastic....stay away from those.) ----They're slightly heavier--which is unavoidable if you want a reinforced core.  (The bad ones are extremely light.  You'll regret it.) ----Most importantly, the exterior fabric looks like a G-Suit or pressure suit hose, with a tight criss-cross weave.  See close-up photo of fabric below. (The bad ones look like bunched up prom dress fabric.)  It really does remind me of hoses you see in aviation---and while I don't expect it to live up to the same pressure-testing standards, it's at least a good sign as compared to the featherweight expanding hoses that look like hair scrunchies.

2731,265877,3,3.0,False,"07 8, 2010",A38NELQT98S4H8,B001UHOWTW,WB Halper,"As a composter, this Ecomposter works great.  The spherical shape doesn't have any corners to trap anything, while the internal air tubes break up any clumps as the composter rolls around.  As long as you turn it regularly, the result is a well mixed, rapidly composting bundle of yard waste.  Incidentally, this STC Ecomposter is not recommended for the following uses:   Fusion Reaction Chamber (see-Lawrence Livermore Shiva Project for details and pictures)   Dog Toy (unless you have a very large dog)   Soccer Ball   Christmas Tree Ornament   A birthday pinata   Lunar Lander and/or UFO.  I do want to compliment STC on the assembly instructions.  The instruction booklet is clearly written and well illustrated.  Each type of part comes in its own labeled bag.  Spares are included for the parts most likely to get lost.  Assembly takes a while, but if you can follow instructions, you'll put this together in a couple of hours...or days...  I recommend wearing some lightweight gloves while assembling the sphere.  I pinched my skin a couple of times between various plastic pieces and gloves definitely helped once I put some on.  And, as one other reviewer pointed out, don't assemble it inside.  Only half a sphere will fit through a door.  Trust me.  November 24, 2010 update:  After using the Ecomposter for a summer and change, I'm downgrading my original five stars to three.  I have three different composters: this one, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lifetime-60021-75-Gallon-Compost-Tumbler-Black/dp/B0030GG2FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lifetime 60021 75-Gallon Compost Tumbler, Black</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earth-Machine-Compost-Bin/dp/B003S57WDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earth Machine Compost Bin</a>.  Of the three, the Lifetime 60021 has proven to be my favorite.  The Ecomposter has a few problems.  First, as the contents decompose, they pack down.  The weight in the bottom of the sphere makes it difficult to turn.  Being a sphere, there's nothing to grab hold of and putting my fingers in the holes only works if the contents aren't too heavy...I ended up using an old screwdriver stuck into the aeration holes to get some leverage.  Second, the  top is not particularly easy to remove and reattach.  Dirt and (I assume) a bit of warpage add together and I need to brush off the track before I can turn the top back to the locked position.  On the other hand, the Lifetime composter rotates around a center shaft.  It opens and locks easily and seems to work just as well.  It just doesn't look as cool.  There's not much to say about the Earth Machine.  It's simply a plastic cylinder (although technically it's a truncated cone) that you fill up with yard and kitchen waste.  You let it sit and occasionally stick in something to mix it up.  Of the three, I'd rank the Lifetime first, this second and the Earth Machine third...the latter just because it's boring.",A great design for a composter.

Riley,"I really like the Weber Q series of grills and now that I am on my second one, a Q200 (my Q100 was stolen) I decided to get a cart for my new, larger grill.  Weber makes two carts for it, the 6507 Rolling Cart and this item, the 6508 Stationary Cart.  The reason one is called ""stationary"" and the other ""rolling"" is because the 6507 folds up and includes a strap so that one can use it as a caddy for transport.  Since it folds you can put it in the trunk of your car.  If the folding feature is not important to you, they both function the same as far as moving them around when the 6507 is fully upright.  The 6508 Stationary Cart includes a hose adapter for the 20 lb. LP tank and the other does not.  It also seems better built and includes a screen that blocks the tank from view.  The cart was fairly easy to assemble, even though I hate to put things together.  It took me about 30 minutes and I only used one or two bad words.  I would have spent more money for a cart that had more metal and less plastic, but it is what it is.  It still seems well built and sturdy enough.  When you fold out the shelves on the 200 or 220 this portable BBQ pit transforms into a really nice, small, full featured gas grill.  I find it easy to move around I think that this is a good compromise for someone who wants both a portable grill and standard-type one.  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weber-6507-Rolling-Cart/dp/B000WXFHJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weber 6507 Rolling Cart</a>",Excellent cart for a great little grill,1218412800,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BYY1v7nOL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Nq9-wZzCL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SSetS+GvL._SY88.jpg']","adapter second nice plastic move transforms view use assemble find upright feature like someone bbq think function stationary get want important spent cart sturdy enough seem caddy trunk minute money lb well less cart</a fairly fold put thing really weber standard-type one series new transport far large reason good take use roll lp together grill pit full fully decide screen hate shelf would grill metal item bad folding also still even block data-hook=""product-link-linked hose strap easy class=""a-link-normal gas fold build steal car around since word move two include though call make feature well cart small portable tank compromise"

Given I've had the expensive nozzle for over 10 years now without a hicup lends strength to the adage; 'you get what you pay for'. But who in their right mind would pay $90 for a hose nozzle? Well, I did once but the good news now is that this $10 nozzle is the best I've ever used in this price range and unlike others in this price range, should last virtually forever (because there are no inherent design flaws).  Others have raved about the Gilmour nozzle and so I bought one only to find out that it breaks. Turns out it is made from three pieces of brass, two of which are press fit together; the inner core and the part that screws onto the end of the hose.  The outer jacket, the part that is supposed to turn to adjust the spray is the third piece.  When you torque the outer jacket down to shut off the flow, stress is induced on the press fit joint which eventually fails.  The press fit joint is now so loose, that I can't turn the outer jacket to adjust the flow without the core spinning at the joint.  That is, the core begins to turn and it leaks at the place where the two pieces are press fit together. Worse yet, I can't turn the jacket to shut off the flow. Only took 4 months of light use to happen.  THIS nozzle is only two metal pieces! The outer jacket, that turns to adjust the spray and shut off the flow, and the inner core which is one piece of  machined brass all the way from the part that screws on to the hose to the center tip of the nozzle.  Internally there are a couple of replaceable 'O' rings in addition to the requisite washer where the nozzle screws onto the hose end.  The spray pattern is typical from wide mist to hard stream.  Brass is soft, relatively speaking and I do not recommend leaving this nozzle outside in a presurized state after the outside temp falls below freezing.  (to help you appreciate the $90 nozzle, you could leave that thing anywhere, anytime of the year, and even bury it, only to dig it up and find that it works like new.  Combined with a good hose you could even leave the whole set up outside year round and forget about it.  Which I've done for over ten years.  Come spring thaw, it would be right as rain.)  Gilmour makes some great products, like their Flexogen hose, but I'll stick to Dramm for the brass fittings.  **UPDATE** 18 Dec 2012. I don't remember when I wrote this (I see it now, over two years ago) but it really was under $10 at that time....as of today it's 30% more?!

The chairs come packed in two boxes (2 chairs in each box) and the table top and base are packed separately. There are directions and a pair of wrenches included to enable assembly. While it is possible to do this by oneself it would help to have a second person, especially for lifting the table top and positioning it so it can be bolted to the base. The directions have a couple flaws, such as mislabeling the length of one of the bolts (an error that was obvious since there were just 2 sets of bolts and it was clear which one was really being referred to) and showing the bar attaching the swivel rockers to their base as a separate piece when it is already attached to the bottom of the chair. Apparently these were generic instructions designed for use with multiple products. I found this set not hard to assemble, though I am pretty accustomed to do-it-yourself furniture assembly. The cast-aluminum seems sturdy and should be durable, the tabletop is very nice and has a luxurious appearance, and the chairs are comfortable.

Now, I initially bought an electric smoker from Amazon about a year ago, I bought the Masterbuilt Electric smoker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterbuilt-20070106-30-Inch-Electric-Smokehouse-Smoker-Black/dp/B00104WRCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterbuilt 20070106 30-Inch Electric Smokehouse Smoker, Black</a>&nbsp;after deciding to get into smoking meats. I choose electric because of the convience of being able to set the temp and let it run without having to touch it until the meat was done. Well, it worked fairly well....for a year... Then the smoker died and I found heating elements were not availalbe for the unit and the main control unit was not working. Technology and grills/smokers don't seem to mix very well...  So, I needed a new smoker and after contemplating on getting a $75 brinkmann smoker from the local hardware store I decided to pay the premium for the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker and let me tell you this thing makes perfect smoked foood! My first attempt at smoking with this smoker was pork butt. My wife wanted to take the pulled pork to work with her the next day so my first smoke experience was an overnight. I was worried about temp fluctuations so I set my alarm to wake me up every 90 minutes to check on the temp and make adjustments as needed. I never had to make one adjustment! I started the charcoal using the minion method (fill charcoal ring with unlit coals, then take a chimney of about 10 coals and put them on top, mix in a few pieces of apple wood and set vents about 1/4 open on bottom and leave top vent on top open) The cooker got to about 225 degrees and stayed at that mark for 12+ hours without me having to add more coal, open or close the vents or any other maintenance. I was upset after waking up every 90 minutes I actually didn't do anything, but at the same time I was so impressed this thing worked so well out of the box without any tweaking like is needed on cheaper units. Fyi, I smoked the butt at 225 degrees for about 13 hours with 2 foil packs filled with apple wood chips, I was going to use apple wood chunks but couldn't find any and I found the foil packs of apple wood chips work perfectly!  My second smoke was a turkey as the plan is to use the smoker for our thanksgiving turkey this year and rather then try my first turkey on thanksgiving I figured we'd do a practice turkey. I got the smoker up to approx 225 degrees again using the minon method listed above and put the turkey on the smoker, it sat for about 10 hours (12lb bird) and when the internal temp reached 165 degrees I took it off and let it rest. The bird was juicy and so good. Once again used apple wood chip foil packets.  This smoker is fantastic. Is it more difficult then electric? No, both require cleanup but the scientific properties of smoke from charcoal are definitly different then smoke from electric smokers, somehow it infuses into the food much more efficiently and you can tell by the visible smoke rings on the meat. The weber smokey mountain cooker really is as easy as it gets and the reason is the design and construction. You could get cheaper units but the modifications you would need for proper air-flow, plus the thickness of the smoker is important and Weber uses high grade steel. You really get a premium product when you choose the smokey mountain. The only gripe I have is the door on the side to add more coals or wood chips or refill the water pan. The door is sort of flimsy however there are sites where you can find replacement after market doors for approx $20 that are very strong. Maybe one day I'll upgrade but for now the included door works well, just a little thin.  If you want a smoker I highly recommend this unit. It will easily cook a turkey and a ham or pork butt at the same time. I've seen pictures of people cooking a total of 50lbs of pork shoulder perfectly. This smoker rocks and will last a long time, after all it's metal and comes with a 10 year limited warranty. My old electric smoker that lasted approx a year before it died had a 90 day warranty and was poor quality at nearly the same cost! Stick with American made, high quality and get yourself the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker, you won't regret it!! Well...maybe you'll regret not getting it sooner! :)",better then electric smokers!

The Ambient's remote sensors are small, 1 3/4""W x 4 3/8""L but they just fit into the Boveda bag. No way will you be able to fit the Ambient base unit into the Boveda bag.  Yes the Boveda kit works but you can save time and money by testing your hygrometer using the salt test. It gives the same results. How to: www.cigarsinternational.com/cigar-101/article/29/salt-test I used a large zip lock bag and a coffee scoop filled with 2 tablespoons of table salt. Ideally you should use distilled water but filtered water from your refrigerator (which I used) or tap water, if you have a water softener, works fine. Dampen the salt with enough water to give you a sno-cone appearance. If you have water floating on top of the salt you have added too much water. Place the salt and hygrometer in a zip lock bag, leave some air in the bag, and wait ~24 hours. If your hygrometer is correctly calibrated it will read 75% humidity. My hygrometer reached its max reading of 72% after 8 hours but I waited 24 hours just to make sure. What's great about the Ambient sensors is that you can set them to 75% with the base unit without taking the sensor out of the bag. Next up was the Boveda kit. After allowing the sensor to come back down to my house humidity, ~36%, I placed it in the Boveda bag. It took ~28 hours before it reached 72% humidity. After 36 hours it was still reading 72%. So I suggest if you use the Boveda kit to keep your hygrometer in its bag at least 30 hours or more. Both the Boveda calibration kit and my salt test produced the same results for my hygrometer, 72% humidity.  I gave it a 3 star rating based on the fact that, even though it does work, its bag is only big enough for testing small hygrometers.",Works but you can save money by using just plain table salt!!,1421193600,{'Style Name:': ' 75% RH Level'},,give house air directly read much wait base use remote star work refrigerator way sno-cone result tap hour ideally come salt take fine next unit least enough wait big sure great test reach sensor money correctly place read appearance float hygrometer suggest bag lock calibrate fact digit max back table place account calibrate add softener compare yes able scoop give take use large fit amazon hygrometer tablespoon thermo-hygrometer calibration time test purchase produce what's method top wireless ambient's zip still work even water leave discover sensor humidity make rating cashback set two without dampen though weather rh distil kit filter boveda nacl fill use allow base one-step ambient save keep small coffee give

Ironite being soluble is much faster acting, but it should not be over applied as caliche quickly sequesters iron that is not quickly taken up by plants and grass.

Edit: Longer more in-depth review below, keep scrolling.  In the past, allowances for lower performance have had to be made for electric tools in general and battery electric tools in particular, when compared to their gas counterparts.  This is no longer the case. This saw is 100% equivalent to a 42cc gas saw. Same cut depth, similar cutting speed, a battery even lasts about as long as a tank of fuel.  The chain was about the right tension out of the box, but loosened quickly with use, as any new chain will do. I notice lots of reviews mentioning the chain coming off the bar - proper chain tension is vital to safe and efficient operation of any saw and and if your chain is coming off, your chain is almost certainly too loose. There's a good guideline for tensioning the chain on the Greenworks site, a previous attempt to include a link got nuked by Amazon. If your chain is coming off, I strongly recommend looking up the gudeline and following the directions.  A note on safety: ANY TIME THE BATTERY IS IN THE SAW, IT IS LIVE. Don't do anything to this saw with the battery in place that you wouldn't do to a gas saw with the engine running. Yes there are safety interlocks, that's why the saw turns itself off so quickly. Yes it's annoying sometimes, I consider it worth the trouble. Hand the saw to someone, what's the first thing they do? Pull the trigger. With a gas saw, it's incredibly obvious when the engine is running and it's fairly easy to be safe. With a battery electric saw, there is both no such indicator and also a wide belief that these are just ""toys"" and that standard safety practices can be circumvented. That is simply not the case, this saw will take a limb off just as easily as a gas saw. So again, any time the battery is in the saw, it is live. Don't do anything to this saw with the battery in place that you wouldn't do to a gas saw with the engine running.  9/15/16 Addition: Have a bit more experience with this saw now, 3+ cords of wood cut.  I harvest firewood logs from logging operations or BLM(that's Bureau of Land Management) land. Easier to handle and strap down whole logs, and then bring the logs home to cut into firewood rounds. My big monster is a Stihl 034 Super AV. This is a 61.5cc pro saw, it weighs a lot, vibrates a lot(even with the antivibe), is loud, etc, and I'm not getting any younger. In the past for lighter duty work I've used and worn out multiple 42cc Poulans, despite being tuned correctly(they are tuned lean from the factory and will burn up quickly if left in factory tune). I consider them about the perfect size/weight saw for this. Cut well when properly tuned and sharp, light weight, maneuverable, less vibration and less noise than the monster above. They just don't last, they are a homeowner saw. I have no problems buying quality, but every time I'm about to pull the trigger and buy a smaller lighter pro-grade Stihl that will go the distance, another Poulan comes along for $5 at a garage sale with a gummed up carb because the owner used it once to trim one limb and then put it in the garage and five years later it won't start. I can fix that easily, and at $5, who cares if it only lasts a couple years?  Finally ran out of Poulan saws and was about to head to the saw shop to get a better saw when I came across this battery electric curiosity. I already own and love the 80v string trimmer and mower, already well invested in batteries and chargers, figured why not try it?  With the back story and usage situation out of the way, more on the saw:  I'm glad I bought it.  Being brushless and without much to wear out, it should last far longer than other homeowner internal combustion saws, which in my experience lose compression after ~4 cords of wood(one more cord to go for this saw to equal them).  It's much quieter than a gas saw, but still right on the edge of needing hearing protection. Measurements found online put this at 89 db, Osha 8 hour exposure limit is 90db, hearing protection generally recommended over 80-85 db. Personally I have not bothered with hearing protection as I routinely listen to music and drive vehicles much louder than this, but hypocritical as it is, I am recommending that others should use hearing protection.  Not breathing exhaust, handling gas, and having the stink of two stroke exhaust on you after cutting is NICE.  The bar the saw comes with is garbage. I've never seen a chainsaw bar flex before? Throw the bar away and put a real bar on it, Oregon makes decent ones. The chain is acceptable, though Oregon chains are not as sharp out of the box as Stihl chains, nor do they last as long. Neither is as sharp out of the box as a skilled sharpener(me, not to brag) can get them with a file. I wish the saw pumped more bar oil. Like other homeowner saws, don't run full comp chain on this saw, the 18"" bar is mostly braggadocio and while it will pull the full bar through a cut with skip tooth, it'll beep overload at you shortly. Full comp wouldn't be a good idea at all.  The charger can be powered by a stout power inverter in a vehicle for use away from an outlet. I have four batteries and can cut a full truckload of logs into rounds without going through all four batteries, but being able to charge on the go is a nice backup. If you're operating away from an outlet regularly and this will be your only saw, gas might be a better option for you.  This is getting wordy, time to wrap this up. In summary, if you buy bar oil and two stroke premix by the quart and have never cleaned an air filter, this is the saw for you. If you pay someone else to sharpen your chains, this is the saw for you. If you let your saw sit more than a year between uses, this is the saw for you. If you have other 80v equipment in this line already and those other items apply to you, this is DEFINITELY the saw for you. Way better than any gas powered saw in this class.  If you mix saw gas up in a 5 gallon can and it might last you all week and buy bar oil by the 55 gallon drum, this might be a surprisingly good option for some uses.","Every bit as powerful as a comparable gas saw, without the fumes or maintenance of a gas engine, in depth update 9/15/16",1473120000,,,fuel pro power i've performance shop shortly vibration notice come lean protection wide harvest glad toy edge carb equivalent try one compression garbage last problem strongly get homeowner thing mower certainly osha wood(one buying later hypocritical allowance chainsaw factory pro-grade trigger charge neither brag loosen despite annoy light right cut inverter pull let far yes premix recommend easy home speed quickly backup couple hour bit almost across version sale attempt gallon vehicle small finally young include easily idea experience clean vibrates run saw two last run without powered noise go site year note apply loose every lose truckload lot(even wish combustion review tune duty away skilled db much drive round like charger week turn four tooth might counterparts listen invested hear limit definitely chain trouble tensioning routinely well burn long care surprisingly see obvious one depth personally love new make electric whole string option vehicle stout worth log curiosity amazon first item weight cord time buy etc general also decent link still proper comp braggadocio five year mention gas circumvent case monster av story overload though run there's gum stink low vital nuke tank nice tune gudeline interlock use hand head work fix greenworks longer charger recommend skip cut antivibe generally maneuverable simply others disclosure battery lot log stroke brushless take big quieter less cord find box leave music fairly poulan handle sharpen exhaust lot quality back size/weight place distance similar able good consider online use worn come safety equal get particular what's mostly lowes/kobalt sometimes standard trim usage outlet filter operate start pump strap sharpener(me wood garage sit buy limb breathe i'm oil incredibly saws equipment along come tension previous management guideline direction well another land look bother firewood in-depth air flex need way blm(that's oregon pay properly someone wrap perfect wear practice recommend addition drum multiple already bar real handle line put safe owner that's poulans green tool stihl file summary efficient sharp compare live go loud operation operation engine super light full wordy measurement blue bureau correctly(they situation figure even easy else mix edit it'll never indicator bring class review scroll louder instead battery belief weighs make regularly beep quart acceptable past get throw internal trimmer anything exposure use keep chain follow

I then bought a Greenworks light duty line trimmer sans battery and used the battery from the chain saw.  That also was light weight and sufficiently powerful to do light trimming.  We have a .81 acre lot so most of the lawn cutting is done with a garden tractor.  Still, I need a push mower to mow around beds and in tight spots.  My gas powered mower died.  I ended up with an EGO self propelled mower with 7.5 amp 56 volt battery from Home Depot for $499...  great price.  Now back to the blower vac.  I considered a very light duty Greenworks blower (only) for $30 that could use my 2 amp hour battery but that model was either unavailable or had spotty reviews.  The above Greenworks unit had consistently good reviews on multiple sites, even though as a vacuum, it may not be the best.  Ordered it from Amazon and had it in 2 days.  Assembly was easy.  The controls take some getting used to or experimentation as they are not accurately described in the manual.  Play with it!  You can figure it out!  As a generic blower, this unit has more power than I expected.  Although only rated at 185 MPH, it seems to have more power than the 205 MPH TroyBilt.  Perhaps the impeller on the TroyBilt had deteriorated?  Anyway, it works real good for blowing away grass clippings, leaves, etc.  The push button start is great compared to a pull start.  The lighter weight makes it easier to operate.  I have run it for quite some time on the highest setting and have not had to recharge the battery thus far  I tried the unit as a vac.  It is easier to assemble / reconfigure than the TroyBilt.  Physically and not unlike the TroyBilt, using it as a vac is a bit awkward.  However, it seemed to work pretty well.  There is a crevice outside our family room that attracts and holds onto leaves  This unit got them out very quickly.  Not sure it's going to pick up or mulch big piles of leaves in the Fall, not did I expect it to.  All things considered, I am satisfied with this item and would recommend it to anyone, as long as it's not expected to do heavy duty mulching.",More Powerful Than Expected and Light Weight!,1530662400,{'Style:': ' 40V Blower/Vac Battery Included'},,fall duty accurately ghost away power blow awkward much mow assembly use assemble quite onto work greenworks troybilt button trimming order model however recommend crevice cut amp powerful could need figure sufficiently room clipping garden battery unit tight vac anyone due mower volt blow compare expect seem take pick big sure sans acre great multiple blower real unavailable recharge ego although long unlike line sufficient impeller seem mulching thing consider one play push tool lot back operate control deteriorate light electric high generic compare pull far blower/vac leave go easier manual home good set debris mph use quickly end self consistently day outside amazon hour price bit light weight die time purchase experimentation perhaps thus attract described get mulch would hold depot item begin etc ago also season still reconfigure anyway satisfied work bed even start easy recently year gas vacuum buy either needs review spot pile i'm electric/rechargeable around grass saw best pretty old cycle try powered tractor though run rat spotty make convert heavy lawn use physically well expect get do site trimmer may family propel chain driveway give

Southern Ag Crossbow has some good video and people supporting them, so I thought I would give it a try.  Waited for dry hot weather with little to no wind and waded into the poison ivy and thistle thicket. Sprayed the largest poison ivy leaves and followed them as far as I could. Around the base of trees, in the undergrowth, across fallen dead trees, the more I sprayed, the more I found and I definitely needed to get a handle on that stuff before it flowered and went to seed!  Within days, I drove past the areas and happily found it all wilting down and dying back. Whew, success and not a moment too soon as I was getting some ""feedback"" from my northern neighbor regarding my weed situation. I also used this spray to kill back wild roses and heavy thorned wild berry stands. It left the grass and my Irish Moss in tact, so I was pretty darn impressed.  DO NOT OVERDOSE- When I was reading the ingredients and mixing instructions, it says for poison ivy you should use 6 ounces to 3 gallons. Some may just grab a measuring cup and fill it to the six ounce mark.. DON'T DO THAT, you will have an overdose if you do. Get a paper cup, put it on an actual scale, zero the cup out and then add the concentrate until you hit six ounces. It's much less liquid than you will be using IF you go by the ounce marks on a measuring cup. Mark the 6 oz. point on your paper cup and save that as your dosage for 3 gallons and you'll be spot on!
