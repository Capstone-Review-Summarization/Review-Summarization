The one on this page is for At&t and T-mobile only in the US, or for international use----------- First I have to say, I don't currently own the S7. I do own the S6 & the htc 10. I compared the M10 & S7 based on few days of use. I like both brands so I'll try to be as fair as possible. Screen: I'm not a pro,so while other reviewers kept talking about depth & black saturation, all I could see is a beautiful, full hd hTc screen, vs a more solid -colored Samsung screen. IMO I prefer how the colors look on the M10 Speed: No winners here, both phone are quick & can do any task u throw at them with equal capacity. If u wanna be too technical the US version of the S7, which comes with an exynos processor does seem to lag slightly, specially with some heavy games! Camera: Image Stabilizer is the winner here. While both 12 MP back cameras seemed to have equally impressive pics, the front ""selfie"" camera on the htc seemed to take much better selfies. Sound: Hands down, the M10 has the best speakers on any phone in the market, period. While I still think the dual bar of the M8 had slightly better sound than the M10, I do think they looked ugly and should have been changed Battery: Both phones have very similar batteries,they both seemed to last almost the whole day with regular use. Browsing, light gaming, internet calling and some netflix. Don't believe htc advertising of 2 day battery. The M10's battery is actually smaller in capacity than most other competitors Design: I have always been a fan of htc's full metal back, and still am, it's actually the reason I bought this one. But I have to say the S7 does look more slick and is slightly lighter than the M10. That's definitely the reason why I took 1 star off. THe htc 10 is slightly heavier than it should, and slightly thicker too. Should definitely have been slimmer & lighter. So , despite the S7 being a dirt & fingerprint magnet ( it is, it will drive u crazy with all those fingerprints!) I think it wins over the design point. Both phones have expendable memory. Both OS are good. However I felt the htc has a much ""cleaner"" operating system, Samsung's touchwiz is just a little too much! To wrap it up, if, like me, u already had the S6 ( i had the edge) don't get the S7, u'll be disappointed for the daily use, since u won't feel that much difference! Get the M10 if U don't have the M9! If u haven't had a Samsung in a while, now is a good time to try it, the phone is really good, but buy a case!",Confused between Galaxy S7 & M10?

Hurricane Sandy rolled through this week, and we had our first real test of the lanterns when the power went out (and stayed out).  The Eddie Bauer lantern was not as bright and lasted only about an hour before going dim.  The no-brand lantern lasted a bit longer but was very difficult to use -- it wasn't configured to put the light where needed.  Our d.lights, on the other hand, performed flawlessly.  We used both the area lantern (the d.light S10) and also this task light (d.light S1).  The area lantern (the S10) kept large (15x30 foot) living spaces lit well enough to work (preparing dinner, etc.).  And the task light (S1) was fantastic for reading, doing paperwork, etc.  All of the d.light lanterns lasted from sundown to bed time at full brightness -- the S10 lanterns were on the whole time (about 6 hours), while the S1 task lights were used intermittently (probably 3-4 hours).  Both the S10 and the S1 are designed for functionality -- the area lantern is very easy to hang, and the S1 task light puts light right where you need it.  Last but not least, they recharged the next day with only partial sunlight and were ready to go for a second night.  Long and the short of it:  D.light lanterns are awesome!  Hands down, these are the best power outage lanterns available, and at a great price.  I just placed an order for a few more.  These are far more valuable than battery-eating flashlights when facing a sustained power outage.  05-Nov-2012:  Important Note.

PAIRING The H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets. Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit ""ok."" This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.  COMFORT/DESIGN The H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.  SOUND QUALITY I've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little ""far-away."" I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.  OVERALL At it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price. If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.",Only decent quality.

Remember that their design and purpose is for bone conduction and bringing awareness to the customer of their surroundings during use. With that being said..  The comfort and fit are great; very snug and secure while working out in the gym and running. Little to know movement in various exercises. So I would say their fit is a high mark.  The design is also pleasing and well thought out; I have used other behind the neck products but these would be at the top. The weight is not noticeable and you know they are on because of the snug fit on your temples. The buttons will take a little getting use to but once you do you can operate the functions easy. Standard volume up and down, pause and skip.  Sound is acceptable - I say this because I did not purchase these for a high level of sound quality such as what you would find in over the ear or in ear headphones. They are surprisingly loud and clear - little to no bass but plenty of treble and you can clearly make out the voice. If you turn it up to the loudest setting I can say there is a bit of a tickling sensation in your ear drum. What I have noticed is that running outside these are great for awareness and providing the music for the added boost. Now, on occasions my local gym decides to crank up the music as if it was a club and when they do then these almost become useless. If the surrounding environment is just that loud then it becomes difficult to listen to your audio.

I had a trident case for my S3 and decided to stick with them since I like how sturdy they are.  Pro's - The two-piece design ensures that this case has a tight fit and will not slide or deform. - The hard plastic on top does not cover any sensors or buttons in a way that makes them difficult to use. - The soft silicone portions help to prevent the phone from sliding, either in your hand, on a table, or on your car's dash.  Con's - The built-in screen protector is a good idea, but it fails to function properly. It does not meld to the screen like other protectors, but leaves a small gap between the protector and the screen. I have removed it from the case but would have to take apart the case once a week to clean out accumulated dust. - There is a piece of plastic right next to the charger port. This keeps a silicone flap in place to help with weather-proofing the phone. This plastic also makes it impossible to use certain charger wires, such as the one I use in my car. The wire will connect but fall out if pressure is not applied. Like the screen protector, I have removed this from the phone and am more satisfied with it. - While it is good that the case is tight due to the two-piece design, it is a real pain to remove. If you don't have strong nails you may need to use a flathead screwdriver to remove it.  Overall, I would probably not recommend this specific case to someone, but I am willing to give Trident another try whenever i upgrade since my S3 case was very good.",Durable Case With Some Flaws,1443571200,,,fall give dust phone hard plastic prevent hand use connect two-piece nail way pro's like ensures weather-proofing built-in charger recommend flap meld con's week properly need someone fail deform try function slide next apart tight soft upgrade sturdy whenever due button wire take silicone real clean pain apply one lot flathead table place right leave good probably fit design protector certain car's help decide screen dash gap trident would top also pressure satisfy port sensor remove difficult idea willing screwdriver case either piece car stick since overall cover keep specific impossible make wire slide accumulate remove strong another portion may protector small

It's the one my Galaxy S4 is ""wearing"" at the moment.  The hard shell is bonded to the protective inner layer.  The silicon ""grip"" portion (horizontal lines on the back of the case) protrude through just a bit, and are very effective at giving you a sure grip.  Without those grips, I wouldn't buy this case, it would be to slippery for me.  The protective silicon lip around the screen is there, but it's not very tall.  That has the advantage of a slimmer profile / less bulk, but if you are using a thicker glass-type screen protector, this might not offer you enough face-down protection.  I'm using the standard plastic film screen protector, and the lip seems sufficient.  I mentioned ""details"" in my description, here is an example.  The corners of the plastic shell are interrupted with narrow channels through which the silicon protrudes.  That's brilliant.  In the event of a drop, it would let the hard case edges, particularly the vulnerable corner, to flex a bit, reducing the likelyhood of cracking, while the softer silicon can take the brunt of the impact inertia.  That's just a nice touch.  There are more protective cases out there, but I really like the look of the Speck Grip, and it has a quality feel in the hand.  If the trade-off is between protection and bulk, the Speck CandyShell Grip is a good compromise for me, working in an indoor environment that is just a little harsher than carpeted office setting.  For a little more protection in similar style, I like the Ballistic Aspire cases also.

182,2027,2,False,"06 3, 2010",A6K0AEJ6HKBJM,B000A3OLZC,,Travellin&#039;,"PLEASE, PLEASE READ MY WHOLE ARTICLE BEFORE BUYING ANY BOOSTER SYSTEMS.  I purchased this booster some time ago, Oct 2009. Upon installation, I did not see any improvement. I contacted Wi-Ex and after a few days of bitching, they sent me a new system. The new system was a bit better but still did not do what they claim it to do. I've continued to use this booster for 8 months total now and here is my analysis.  First, they claim that this unit will cover a home of 2500 sq ft. LIE.  Second, they claim that this will reduce dropped calls... HALF A LIE  Here are the facts:  1- You will only get a boosted signal from the base unit ONLY if the receiving antenna has a strong signal. I have 2 bars in my attic, where the receiving antenna is installed, and the coverage range from the base unit is only anywhere from 2 inches to 3 feet from the base unit.  2- In my situation, the coverage area dramatically drops as soon as I'm out of the 3 foot radius of the base unit. As soon as I'm about 10 feet from the base unit, the signal will drop to zero bars on my phone (Palm Pre) and the phone will intermittently switch to Roaming. (This also occurs with an HTC Touch Pro 2 as well).  I contacted Wi-Ex and they told me that the max range of the boosted signal will be 15 feet. That's right, he said 15 feet. They why do they advertise full house coverage? And also claim a 2500 sq ft home coverage on this unit. I was also told that if my input signal is only two bars, that the output from the base unit is reduced to a lower radius/range. This is not what is advertised. As a matter of fact, while I was on the phone with the rep, he kept asking me to repeat myself because I kept breaking up. He asked me to repeat myself three times, yes, three times, and my distance to the base unit? About two feet at that time and the bar strength indication on the phone? That was at 1 bar!! Yes, 1 bar!!!  So basically, if you have full bars (a strong signal) outside of your home, then the boosted signal inside your home will be greater. I want everyone to know this. DO NOT BE MISGUIDED!!!! This system is only as good as your signal outside your home. If you have FULL strength outside your home and have no signal strength inside your --- a basement for example, then, you will have good coverage in your basement room ONLY.  Also, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned:  The Wilson system gives you a better coverage radius than the Wi-Ex unit. However, the Wilson unit continuously loses it's signal and the base unit's LED will switch from green to amber to red quite often! Again, neither of these units really improves your indoor signal if your outdoor signal is not at 100%. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR INDOOR RECEPTION TO BE BOOSTED THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE 2500 SQ FT HOME!! This will NOT happen. These two units are misrepresented to make a sale. This is not to say that the Wilson is a better buy, it is not! The coverage radius is only increased by about 1 foot using the Wilson unit. As soon as you are out of this range, your signal will drop and switch over to Roaming as well.  Do not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window. These will give you that same result and you don't have to climb into your attic or bore holes in your home to hang an external antenna. More importantly, they cost about $100 less.  I have disconnected both units and the signal strength at my desk is at 2 bars without a booster. (Intermittently of course but good enough and better than with the boosters in place). I of course, lose my signal in the basement, but the boosters didn't provide me with better signal strength either so for me, it's not a loss.  Note: I did abide by the distance requirements called for by each manufacture and those called for by the FCC. I only operated my cell in close proximity only to perform my tests.

The fit is snug and I don't feel like it will slide off like my Plantronics did. I think I have average size ears, and I'm sure that factors into the fit. The small, flexible loop that snaps into shape around my ear also helps. It has long battery life and short charge time, and its compact size doesn't look silly or call too much attention to itself while I'm wearing it.  I only use this to answer calls, and to make outgoing calls when I dial by hand on my phone. I don't use voice commands, so I don't know how well that works. I think the range is either smaller than what the company claims, or walls interfere with the reception. I've lost my connection 2 or 3 rooms away from the handset. I usually keep my handset with me, though, so this isn't really a big deal. I don't know what would necessitate having your handset 300 feet away from you while talking to someone anyway.  For some reason, mine didn't come with set up instructions. However, it was easy to pull up product instructions on the company's website to get connected and running.

Wagoner,"I purchased this protective case because I liked that I could get decorative battery covers and use a clear case to cover it all.  This case was so inexpensive, I wasn't really holding high hopes. Maybe it would be good, maybe not - roll the dice and see.  I am pleased to say that this case is really much better than I thought it ever would be.  First, the button covers. Most protective cases have cutouts for the buttons on the left and right sides of the phone.  This one completely covers the buttons.  The nice thing, this doesn't at all diminish the feel or the usefulness of the buttons - and dirt and debris can't get into the little cracks and crevices, which I love. The top and bottom cutouts are correctly placed and the camera opening is generous without being sloppy.  I have only had the case for a short time so I can't speak to its durability.  I can say that I am able to take the case off without using a sharp object, which is a plus, but I don't ever get the sense that it's too lose or insecure at all.  As I mentioned, I want to change the battery covers out seasonally so I find it wonderful that I can get this off fairly easily.  The case is soft, and though it isn't slick, it won't stop the phone from sliding off of a surface by itself.  With that said, I put my remote control on a slick surface and my phone, with case, on the same surface next to it and tilted the surface to see what would happen.  The remote slid much more quickly than the phone with the case. I had at least 25 seconds longer to catch the phone with the case than I believe it would have slid off without the case.  I like the odds that turns in my favor.  For a case that runs less than eight bucks, I'm very pleased.  I might go ahead and get a couple to save in the event that this isn't durable, because I sure do think I got a good deal.",Really good deal,1441756800,,,case nice phone much durability maybe use thought find remote buck longer button event like ever say diminish slid surface dirt slick cover could turn might completely think slide next battery usefulness can't least soft get generous high hope dice thing opening button object decorative cutout take change roll sure protective run feel stop well correctly place less left eight fairly put catch little really favor one crevice like love seasonally deal right sharp sense speak hold mention able believe durable good debris quickly side crack couple first want time sloppy purchase get would insecure top pleased odds inexpensive tilt ahead see easily bottom second case plus short i'm without cover though wonderful happen go use say save lose clear camera control

These are my initial impressions, and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal, very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.  I gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving.  She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving, and her bluetooth's battery had died.  My friend is not mechanically adept and I would've kept the H680 otherwise.  It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics, but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better.  This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:  1.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.  2.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.  3.  Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet (it's not lengthy) and you get past setting it for your left ear (if that is your desire), the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you.  This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up.  I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.  Though the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking, it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first (contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment)-the rest will follow.  Sound is crisper than with the H680, and appears louder.  You can't go wrong with either, but I think I like this one more.  Update:  1/7/10  Sound is definitely better with this unit, and it appears to hold charge longer than H680.  Voyager is definitely larger than H680.  When you get past that, and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge, you might favor, as I do, the Voyager 510.

It also comes with an adhesive metal plate that you stick directly on the back of the phone if you do not have a case. My husband has a thick rugged protective phone case & used one of the metal plates, he does a lot of driving for work & when going over bumps it would occasionally fall off the mount. He put both metal plates in the case which gave it a stronger hold & he hasn't had a problem since. For a regular case you would likely only need one metal plate.

When I first got it, I was a little disappointed, since it did not close tightly, but have since adjusted to that (guess I was so used to the magnetic closure on IPad cases). I downloaded an app called ""Stay Alive"" so the screen does not go dark in10 seconds (kind of defeated the purpose of having the little window). One screen shows the clock and when you swipe to the left, it shows the weather info (this is the screen I use). But what I love is the fact that when I receive an email, the info regarding the email  runs across the top of the screen- so I do not have to go into my email to see who the email  was from (hope this makes sense!). I also love the fact that I can pick up calls (or hang up) without opening the cover. Can also talk on the phone with the cover closed.  When I am on the internet for a long time, and fold the cover back, I do worry that it might not close tight again -- but I usually just place it down (with the window facing down) for a little while, and seems to be fine. The clock and weather in the window are in black and white (not color as the picture shows) which seems to bother some buyers. I am ok with that. I have also used the timer on my phone, and when it goes off, I can just dismiss it without opening the cover. I love this so much that I plan on buying another in the black (I have the white now and I know that eventually it will get dirty). This is just a great addition to a great phone (which I also LOVE). BTW-- I also love the fact that I do not have to constantly be hitting the on/off button on the side of the phone (main reason I bought it)- just open and close the cover instead. Any questions - just ask, I will be glad to answer if I can. JUST LOVE THIS CASE!!!  Just wanted to add to this review-- if you receive this case and it does not close tightly- send it back. I ended up liking this case so much I bought another in black and it closes with no problem! I can also fold the cover back without worrying that it is not going to close tightly again. Obviously the last one I received was defective. Now that I received one that closes correctly I am even more thrilled with the case!!  Again, I have to add to this review because I just updated to Lollypop (not because I wanted to , but several apps were no longer supported on JellyBean). Once I did this, the front window shows the time & date (which looks nice)-- but I can no longer swipe to the left, to get the weather, and to see incoming emails. I am so incredibly disappointed.

260,648604,4,False,"04 30, 2015",A3NB4OJL1EZRE2,B00S24AH2W,,Austin H,"Disclosure: I was provided a free review unit from MPOW in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The views expressed are my own, and not influenced in any way.  This review is for the Mpow Streambot Console FM Transmitter with Car Charger. The current Amazon listing shows reviews for multiple products, this review is only for the Streambot FM transmitter.  I was in need of a way to connect my wife's iPhone to the factory radio in our new (to us) 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Since it has the rear CD changer connected to the head unit, I had no way to physically connect an iPhone to the radio without either disabling the changer, or replacing the head unit altogether. Neither is a very viable option in my opinion. When offered to test the Streambot product from Mpow, I jumped at the opportunity to see if this could fill the need for us.  Upon receiving the Streambot, the packaging is very small, and contains a car charger with two USB ports, and the Streambot unit which has a wired connection coming out of it that has both USB and 1/8"" audio at the other end. I did not measure the cable, but it is about 30"" long, and the audio cable splits off about 18"" or so from the USB end, allowing you some good freedom in placement for both the Streambot and your device. The Streambot box is very small, measuring about 1""x1.5""x1"" (again, I did not measure, just estimating). It comes with 3M sticky tape on the bottom to allow you to adhere it to your dash. We mounted ours in front of the instrument panel and ran the cable along the recess to the center console where the charger is plugged in and the iPhone sits. But enough about the physical part of the product, lets get to how it works.  This unit is an FM transmitter, as specified above. It works by showing you the FM frequency on a small display and allows you to change it using up or down buttons. The device will remember the station, but there are no memory presets if you travel frequently. For most people, however, that should not be an issue. Changing frequencies is simple, and unless you are going to the other end of the dial, fairly quick. You then simply adjust your radio for the specified frequency. You will also need to connect your device with the included 1/8"" audio cable. The power of the FM transmitter is pretty good. I was able to find a clear frequency, and did not observe any static while playing music or iTunes Radio from my connected iPhone. (As a side note, I also tested this in my Jeep Wrangler that has an aftermarket head unit, with no antenna connected to it. I was still able to use the Streambot without issue, and still had clear music with no static.) The overall quality of the music transmission is good, but not great, as has been the case with any FM transmitter that I have ever tried. It works better than nothing, but is not as good as a direct, physical connection. But it is definitely passable, and is not an indication of the quality of this particular product.  The other feature that this unit gives you is hands free calling. The Streambot has a third button for calling/play/pause. This feature works okay. I had difficulty getting the button itself to work with Siri, although it did work to play/pause and to answer and end phone calls. The call quality is okay. Not great, but not unusable. The microphone is a bit underpowered, although your results will vary based on your vehicle (as stated above, I have a Jeep Wrangler, with a soft top, and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, both of which are noisy rides, with the Wrangler being exceptionally noisy). If you have a quite vehicle, the microphone may be more than adequate, but be warned if your vehicle is noisy. I was only able to use the mic in my Wrangler if I held the Streambot close to my head while on the highway. In the Grand Cherokee, it works okay mounted on the dash behind the steering wheel. The sound though the stereo is good, even though it is being broadcasted over FM. I have observed static in the background while on calls, even though it was not heard during music. That may be a result of the volume needing to be turned up higher for calls versus music, resulting in louder static that is not heard during music. The other issue that we have observed is with the placement of the Streambot unit. You must be careful in how it is positioned, as it can cause feedback between the mic and the speakers in the car. We have not heard the feedback in the vehicle, but it can be heard on the other end. Be mindful of that when choosing the mounting location.  Overall, I feel that this is a quality accessory, and well worth the money, if you are looking for an FM transmitter for a vehicle that does not feature a direct connection. Having used several FM transmitters in the past, this has so far been the best one (admittedly, I have not used one since I stopped using my 3rd gen iPod several years ago, so I am comparing this to models that came out greater than 6 years ago). I rated it four stars because of the minor issues with call quality and the hardware button not working to invoke Siri consistently. But other than that, I am very happy with this unit, and it has been mounted in my wife's Grand Cherokee for continued everyday use.",Good FM transmitter for vehicles without a direct connection.,1430352000,,,product power mounting come ever influence mount heard turn get allow direct placement contain call recess factory happy dial star jump neither part model usb panel audio sticky far state bit jeep high let changer difficulty mic adequate ago work sound volume show split broadcast either exchange overall two ran instrument without device hardware frequency note may aftermarket small review specify phone ride list observe radio connect button siri charger rear could freedom four product connect itunes nothing several button definitely careful console accessory money well long transmitter minor replace upon one new stop memory choose presets option plug give vehicle port worth amazon result remember call view call top streambot issue cd also still wire see physical bottom year vary side case play wife's since wheel try though behind center allow adjust cause sits use allow offer clear frequency hold express use head work microphone however travel simply ipod need opportunity mpow disclosure unit receive location enough change noisy everyday third cable hand must although box music altogether fairly unusable frequently indication quality able free gen good quick use consistently come result position particular background test close static front versus provide underpowered great steer car transmitter best work along come physically well cherokee unbiased change look unless warn measure continue fill find quite observed packaging need way speaker feature result estimate connection admittedly adhere passable disable soft station compare great multiple test simple feel viable invoke exceptionally stereo included issue transmission show answer go iphone display dash wrangler highway honest even feedback opinion mindful current measure review grand louder okay rat play/pause end antenna people past get base tape calling/play/pause pretty fm

These Aukey lenses work great with my iPhone and with the included clips, taking photo/video with these lenses is a breeze.  The wide-angle fisheye lens is great for capturing ""selfies"" and creating viaual effects by rounding the view of the sorroundings. As you can see, the center of the image did not come out distorted with the use of the fisheye lens. The overall view is still very clear but it creates this wonderful full-screen image.  The other lens, the 20X macro lens is very good for magnifying small objects and bringing them to full view using just an iPhone without any distortion. The lens is small but is very powerful. Please see the flower (bottom picture is the one taken using the 20X macro lens).  I remember having to pay $100 for each set of fisheye or macro lens for my Canon Rebel Ti Digital SLR camera.

Pros: Easy to place on windshield, had a very strong suction and was easy to remove when needed. It will hold any phone securely, even with the case on.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Does not block the sides , top or bottom, so charging a phone while it's in the cradle is not a problem.  No vibration when hitting pot holes.  Strong Suction.  This sucker will not fall off the window.  Full 360 degree swivel  Cons: After a few months, the swiveling ball joint starts getting loose.  Even after tightening it to the max, the cradle moves and vibrates slightly.  On 05/05/2013,  it finally died and it became useless, the joint spins and will not hold the cradle up. It droops down like a sad puppy.  The cradle is a 2 piece, the part that holds the phone is one , and the other is the suction cup and swivel joint.  The problem is the clip that holds the cradle to the swivel joint does not lock in place tightly.  Even though it slides it perfectly and it holds snuggly, those who may switch to landscape may see the unit fall off.  The release button becomes harder and harder to push and release your phone.  In the end, when the holder finally died, to add insult to injury, when I pushed the release button, it would not release at all.  I had to literally pry the s*** open to get my phone out.  Even though Mivizu offers a 1 year warranty, where can you file one?  No website, no phone #.  The only reason I gave it a 2 star was that it started off very well.

This one was the pick for the black iPhones in the family.  I was not sure how the flexible plastic case would work and if it would stay on the phone. I have used the soft flexible rubber cases in the past, you know the ones that fall off the phone when you slide then into your jeans pocket.  This one is not at all like that, it is a harder plastic that is just flexible enough to get onto your phone, there is no way it will  come off during normal use. I also really like the texture.  It is a matte finish that gives a little grip and is not slippery,  but it is also not sticky and slides into your jeans pocket with no issue just like the glossy plastic cases.  I saw the review that says that the glossy front bezel makes it look cheap. I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder because I think it looks nice, it matches the shiny bezel on the edge of the iPhone nicely.  The holes are appropriately sized for the rear camera, mute switch,  bottom speakers and lightening plug.  The headphone jack is 'normal' size.  If you have a fat aux cable or headphones you are out of luck, but just make sure that you get the right size plugs an it will work fine.  I have learned over the years of trying to find the right case that you just need to pay attention to size when you buy accessories.  The buttons for the on/off switch and the volume buttons are built into the case.  I have had cases that are too tight and the pressure of the case makes the buttons too sensitive.  That is not the situation with this case. The pressure required on the buttons is appropriate.  If I am being a bit too picky here,  the power button takes just slightly too much pressure to push but  the volume buttons are perfect in terms of pressure.  The case is nicely thin, thinner than other iPhone 5 cases that Iooked at.  But at the same time gives good protection with the lip on front of the case and at the corners.","Fits well, good coverage nice feel",1349654400,,,know case fall texture look nice phone plastic power black much jack iphones slippery use find onto work match rubber way button speaker nicely plug like protection order lip rear pay edge come need fine try guess think perfect mute one size normal tight soft get headphone luck enough fat headphone button pick hard sure multiple slightly cable iooked camera size little finish really bezel one push accessory appropriate issue term beholder right sticky try matte slide jean give good picky iphone use on/off bit cheap sensitive thin time switch would learn buy also pressure thinner situation attention front bottom year appropriately make volume case glossy say plug build lighten pocket saw require corner beauty hole look aux take eye make stay slide past flexible family grip shiny review

I'm honestly not sure what could be rattling around in there, so I'm not sure if it is causing any issues.  Here are my thoughts on this battery pack. 1. The weight is great. It's very light which means it can hang from your phone. Love this feature. 2. There is NO LED when the battery pack is charging your device. Only when it is being charged itself. This is very frustrating when I'm trying to figure out how much juice is left in the battery pack. 3. The battery pack only charges my Galaxy S5 about 40-50%. This is okay.... But I feel like 2800mAh either isn't great for newer devices, or my battery pack doesn't hold a full charge. 4. I'm not sure if its the cable that was included, or the device itself. But sometimes when I plug the charger into my phone it constantly disconnects and reconnects to my phone. (which causes my alarm clock to open and is annoying) 5. Finally, both the battery pack and my phone get hot when using the battery pack to charge. This is a little worrisome because my larger battery pack and wall charger don't heat up my phone.  The low rating is simply because of the overheating, the broken piece of something rattling around inside the battery pack, and the heat issues that I've experienced with my Enerpak Micro. I really like the idea of this device, and I've never had a problem with UNU products before this, but either mine is defective or this product needs some improvement.","Love the idea, but needs improvement.

But in the end I choose ""Tech Armor"" because of two main reasons.  1) Lots of Feedback, some Negative, some Positive 2) Lifetime Guarantee (that one played big part of my final purchasing decision)  So I installed the Glass Screen Protector in the bathroom. I turn up the hot water to create steam, which always works by eliminating floating dust particles.  I clean the my iPhone 5 about five times, with my own iPhone cleaning solutions, then I went I use the included alcohol wipe that is provided by Tech Armor. I then proceeded to use the included Microfiber cloth, I wipe my iPhone back and forth about 5 times and then notice during my final wipe, that it was leaving lint. I wipe it the best I can to remove the lint that was created by the Microfiber cloth that was included.  I got it cleaned very well, then I went ahead and proceeded to install the Ballistic Glass, everything went smooth. I DID NOT put pressure on the glass during the install. I let it ""stick"" to my iPhone 5 automatically. It's pretty neat to see it work, then once it stop sealing itself to my iPhone 5, I then use the included card to push away the few tiny bubbles. After spending about 5 mints doing this, all of the corners fit perfectly on my iPhone 5.  BUT... then I discovered a LINT in the center upper left of my screen. It's the lint that came from the bad Microfiber cloth that was included. The thing is once this is installed, you cannot peal if off and stick it on again. The included Home Buttons (White & Black) looks ok, makes my phone look cheap with it on, so I remove it and keep it as is without using the included home buttons.  So my conclusion is that, this is a very good quality tempered glass screen protector for the iPhone 5 / 5s. Tech Armor needs to ""Upgrade"" their Microfiber Cloth to a lint free cloth. Since I have Lifetime Guarantee. I will attempt to contact them to get another glass and this time around I will purchase a lint free cloth on my own.  I also purchase ""Tech Armor iPad mini with Retina display and iPad mini Ballistic Glass Screen Protector - Premium World's Clearest Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" for my iPad Mini.

When you pull out the sections, the stick is 24"". It takes enough effort to pull them that you feel confident it is not going to collapse until you push the sections down.  This is a one-piece selfie stick, the type I prefer; nothing to assembly, no parts to lose.  And there is no battery to charge, either. It is not Bluetooth, so it runs off the battery of your phone after plugging the cable from the selfie stick into the headphone jack of the phone.  This selfie stick is compatible with iPhone 4-6 and some Android phones. If you find it doesn't work with your phone, then download the free APP ""Camera360"" from Google Play. According to Google, this is the #1 APP in the photography category with more than 400 million users worldwide.  To put your phone on the stick, pull up the top of the clamp, set the phone on the ""arms"" on the clamp bottom and let the top down. The phone is secure. The clamp base and top are covered with soft silicone, which improves holding power and also prevents any scratching of the phone.  You can move the clamp forward and back about 270 degrees to get the angle you want for your phone. When positioned, lock it in place with a thumb screw.  When you are set up and ready to shoot your photos, just press the button on the handle of the selfie stick  As can be expected with a selfie stick so small, the handle is only 3.75"".  But is covered with spongy rubber material that is very soft and non-slip.  This is a simple, well made selfie stick that is strong enough to hold phones safely. What sets it apart from other good, one-piece selfie sticks is its small size.

After looking at iPac and other built-in devices, I just decided this would be easier and less intrusive. I'm glad I did.  Funtionally, it works just as advertised.  It turns itself off when not in use, and turns itself back on (and pairs) when it detects movement.  Note, it is detecting physical motion, like the door shutting and shaking the car, not visual movement.  One of the buttons on the unit will bring up Siri if you have an iPhone, which is very handy for voice dialing.  The speaker is clear to me, and people on the other end say it's fine.  It's fairly low profile and the materials are good.  The only downside is that each time it turns itself on and connects, it plays a little jingle, says what phone it's connected to, and announces it's own battery level.  I wish I could turn this feature off (can I?), a little beep would be sufficient for me.  I tried the FM feature to play a call over the car's speakers, and it was fine - no different from the factory bluetooth system in my wife's car, except you have to tune to that channel AND press the FM button.

So while the case supplies some much needed surface to grip, it also leaves some vulnerabilities exposed.  I suggest better pictures as well.  It sounds like I am slamming the case and I'm really not.  For what it is, it's fine.  But be aware that there is a lot of exposed phone with this case.  If you like Feather type cases, this is much better in terms of feel and materials.

At 3.5x2 1/8x1 1/8 it is pocket size, but the weight of 8.83 ounces may be more than some want to walk around with in their pocket.  It can be easily carried in your pack or purse and takes up little space in your carry-on when traveling.  The maximum capacity is 11000 mAh, but when power is transferred from one device to another there is always a loss due to resistance, which typically is between 10-20%. If you figure that you have at least 80%, 8800 mAh, of charge capacity you shouldn't get caught short.  There is one charge port capable of delivering 2.0A.  It is smart, so if your device takes only 1.0A, that is what it will get.  This means that both tablets and phones will charge at their best speed.  For power banks around 5000 mAh, one port is fine.  However, when it gets to 10000, or more,  I would prefer 2 charge ports.  Chances are if you buy a power bank of this size or larger as your travel charger you have several devices that need to be charged  There is one input port.  The power bank inputs at 2.0A, which a good charge speed.  When charging or being charged, little blue lights tell you the status of the battery. Each light represents 25% of the total capacity. Between times you can check on how much charge power remains by pressing the power button. The lights will go out after a few seconds, you don't need to try to turn them off.  I tested to see if it can charge while being charged and it can't.  When my phone was being charged by the power bank, I plugged a charge cable into the micro USB port.  The phone immediately stopped charging and did not resume until I unplugged the cable from the micro USB port.  I personally don't consider this a serious negative, but it is something some people ask about  If you are looking for a powerful, well made power bank for travel or other use, this  is a good one to consider.  Included with the power bank are a 10"" Android charge cable and a user guide in multiple languages.

With one of the large screen cell phones (HTC EVO 4G) I run through my battery very quickly if I do any extended usage.  I'd have to find a PC or carry a wall charger with me all the time.  Now I don't need to do that, I get at minimum two full charges and some more out of this unit.  This will get me through a heavy use day no problem and charge another device or two.  I also have 3 Ereaders in my family and the IMP500 will be used to charge those as well.  I'm planning on using it to do my Nook Color, and will also use it to charge my kids Pandigital Planets.  Update: I have now utilized it for these ereaders and it works fine.  The charge time is a little longer though.  It's slower than the original charger but when your on the road that's OK.  By the way depending on how I'm using my ereader I'll attach the IMP70D while I use it.  This way the charge on the unit stays longer and I'm sort of running off the eternal battery at the start of the day.  I'm going on vacation to Disney shortly and this device should keep my phone functioning all day in the parks as well as keep one of the Ereader powered for some game playing while we wait in lines.  Update: As I updated above I connected the IMP500 while sitting in line and it extended the readers to run all day waiting in lines.  It also works for the kids Nintendo DS.  I suppose any USB charged device will run longer or charge off of this battery.  By the way you can do more than one device at a time.  Two usb ports allow us techo users to keep multiple devices charged through the day.  Buy the IMP70D, It's size is great (a little larger than a cell phone) and it greatly increases your run time for a cell phone.",Very nice for modern day life.,1320710400,,,techo trent phone function i'll find use update shortly nintendo longer way charge like phone charger depend stay planet need park fine product connect user battery unit get allow i'd wait pc pandigital problem great multiple color device suppose size ok line little charge that's one compliment wall wait original usb increase large go slow port large quickly use charge sit line update utilized full cell screen time sort reader fit ereaders buy also game usage work start attach day road vacation kid htc evo nook extend ereader need run play i'm two minimum power though run device greatly eternal heavy well use disney another carry family keep planning

All of them are going to have the same issues due to the curved screen.  Customer service for TechMatte is outstanding, they reached out to me after after I purchased and again after my review to see if there was anything they could help with.  Overall it's not bad, but since tempered glass can't bend and the screen curves, there are limitations.  There are very small curved edges on the sides of the protector to try and help alleviate this a bit, but just the way the phone is made means you'll never get a perfect solution with glass.  Pros: it protects the screen, no doubt about that.  It also doesn't scratch very easily from what I can tell, used it for about a month and it's still pristine.  Application is also very easy, much easier than the standard dry application flexible screen protectors that you have to line up perfectly on the first try.  Cons: as a result of the curved screen, the edges suffer from dust collecting under it, and the touch sensitivity on the edges of the screen takes a hit.  You have to really press down to drag down the notification panel when in landscape mode.  I also use Samsung Pay, a quick way to access your card is to drag up from the bottom of the screen, and this proves to be more difficult with the screen protector on.  When trying to press keys on the edge of the keyboard or anything else around the edge of the screen a harder press is required.","Good, but with some drawbacks",1488412800,,,dust phone month limitation much use keyboard samsung way customer service dry say notification could solution pay edge try perfect glass can't get pros mode curve due alleviate con press curve sensitivity harder reach mean temper good line bend really prove one touch application tell make panel let try go easy techmatte quick use probably perfectly side access card first bit protector want help screen result outstanding purchase scratch collect standard issue bad also still see edge hit easy easily bottom else drag difficult never key galaxy around since overall require doubt preface take pristine landscape suffer flexible anything protector protect small review

Seems such a simple idea, but it has revolutionised charging procedures in my house! The updates are; more ports and ALL smart ports! Smart ports, in case you didn't know, automatically detect the charging current of the device you plug in, and automatically charge that device at the fastest / safest level. Standard chargers have different amp outputs on different ports, commonly marked as 'iPhone', 'Android', 'Tablet' etc, sometimes leaving people (me especially) unsure of the best port to use.  The usual Anker quality shows through, quite a small unit in smooth white plastic, quite heavy which is good as it doesn't slide around the table too easily. The mains lead is nice and long, always a bonus.  There doesn't seem to be any discernible difference between charging a device through this unit, or charging it 'directly' I am sure someone, somewhere, will do a direct comparison and thrill us all with reams of scientific data such as optimum current, cable length to resistance ratio, amount of heat generated and much more.

It's a much better way to charge while in the car than to use my car's built in ports. The Dual Port USB Car Charger by Aukey is really something. It not only gives you two ports,but also allows you to charge at the fastest pace even when your using your device. It has great output and can quickly charge my phone back up to at least 30% on a short drive.  Sometimes, I would be in the car trying to charge my phone while using it, but the phone won't budge any further than maintain or start slowly losing battery power. Why, I wonder because it's not being charged by a high power charger and my phone has so much battery power needed to keep it performing the background stuff, that it uses more than the adapter was helping to give back.  Therefore, with the Aukey USB Charger I was given more charging power than the built in ports on my car. This outputs a max of 2.4A while my car only does 1A. I even now don't have to worry about pulling my phone out of the charger so my passenger can use it as well because of the Dual Ports, we both can charge at the same time and with the exact amount of high performance as one would get.  The design is great too and the high quality PCB means you also are protected by overheating, which causes problems for batteries if your charging and it doesn't need to be charged anymore than it is.

This is first, beautifully made,  no cheap corners cut,  it comes with everything you need to get your phone prepared to install the screen protector and also,  the clearest directions, and you will not find this at all difficult to install onto your phones screen!  I  promise you that!  It is so very easy,  it sets beautifully and this type of screen protector,  has NO bubbles!  yahoo!! The thing I wanted to mention, that was one thing really important to me,  is what stopped me from buying a tempered glass screen protector for years, and kept me using the rather defenseless plastic ones. First myth: They add bulk to your phone... Fact:  NO they do NOT add any bulk to your glass!  My defense cases and outterbox commuter cases fit lovely, perfect fits,  and you cannot see that there is something else on your screen. I must say,  I love that it looks like its just my screen,  AND it feels like my screen! Second myth: They lower your touch screen's touch sensitivity... Fact:  NO they do not at all interfere with your screen's sensitivity and actually,  another point,  is that the feel of the glass, and the touch sensitivity,  I have been using mine for two weeks,  to make sure I had substantially used my phone a lot, with the screen protector on, so I could give the most honest review possible,  and the thing I mentioned before,  it is like my original glass!  I love it!  so smooth and perfect touch sensitivity! Third Myth: My cases won't fit anymore: Fact:  Again,  there IS no added bulk!  truly and honestly,  I am using mine, and have for a little over 2 weeks, I am using my otterbox defender case now,  and also used my commuter case and a symmetry case I have,  just to check if my expensive cases would still fit,  that is of great import!  I paid a lot for my case,  as you all have too I am sure, and you want that protection you invested in to still be of use and YES it absolutely is,  there is no added bulk,  no added thickness, my cases have fit as they would and did before, with no glass screen protection. I hope this helps, because I Have the Samsung galaxy s5,  and yes, my cases all of them,  fit lovely! Fourth Myth: They don't work: Fact:  which I am so happy to share!  I have dropped my phone,  as we all do on occasion, although,  I will admitt,  I drop mine more than the average person! I have small hands and a large phone!  so I usually drop my phone,  every other day,  or okay...maybe daily! I did however drop it without its case on,  and only this glass screen protector,  and that is how my old phone,  my Samsung galaxy s4, got replaced by the now,  s5!  the screen was smashed,  on my s4,  but...It had no case and had a plastic screen protector on!  I never bought the cheaper plastic screen protector either,  I paid a lot for them,  and another thing,  replaced them monthly, because of scratches and general wear on them.  So yes,  I Have or did, put a lot of money into the plastic screen protectors. So upon dropping my galaxy s5,  without case but with this glass screen protector.  I had NO issues!  NOT a one!!  it feel flat on the screen too, and I was honestly surprised that the glass protector did not break,  nor take a single scratch!  So I purchased 2,  so that on my first,  I could play around, and see,  will keys scratch it,  will sand?  Will dropping it ...well okay that drop was accidental!  But still,  NO damage to the glass, OH this is truly amazing protection guys and gals! That is just my honest opinion,  I don't work for these guys,  or amazon,  I stumbled onto this by pure luck! Because like you,  I am just a normal amazon shopper,  I ordered and paid for my my screen protector,  and no one asked me to do a review, I just want you all to know, I am honestly that pleased with this find..... when you find a gem,  you must share with all ! I did buy 2,  like I said to play around and see how much damage i could inflict.  I am still using my first one, and don't see it needing a change, because I could not scratch or wear at the glass, not at all.  I love how easy installation is,  I love how well it has attached itself seamlessly to my phone's original screen,  I really love how well it protects my original glass, and do very much love how it looks and feels!! I ordered mine,. through amazon, and it was the, Samsung's galaxy,  s5 I ordered and the company brand is, COOLREALL so I have not been so excited about a phone screen protector before!!  I had in the past found plastic ones I cold live with,  but they needed to be replaced every couple weeks. I do not see this needing to be replaced!  It offers a lifetime replacement warranty,  and I see why!  You won't need another!

I say always, but I've really only purchased 3 items from them over the last four years (because the lifetime warranty is fantastic, they mean it). I haven't really tried any other brand, but I've never really needed to. Tech Armor screen protectors are a great value, high quality, and have that lifetime warranty I mentioned. This pair of screen protectors for the Surface Pro 3 is no exception! Important note before I forget: keep track of your order number. Flag the email as important or something. You'll need it to take advantage of the warranty.  Some good things: it doesn't hinder visibility, it has cutouts for camera/mic/light sensor/speakers, protects well, and it's quite difficult to tell there's even a screen protector on there. It comes with everything you need for application (stickers, cleaning cloth, bubble killer) and 2 protectors, so you get a freebie screw up. Also, Tech Armor is one of my favorite organizations because of their great customer service.  Some not so great things: the screen protector (obviously) doesn't feel like glass, so dragging your finger across it isn't nearly as smooth. This is somewhat related to the fact that this screen protector attracts a LOT of fingerprints and smudges, quite a bit more than the Surface surface itself (note, this is only for the HD clear protectors, I can't speak for the matte).  There's not much to say about the screen protectors, which is honestly a good thing. As always though, a screen protector only seems as good as the user's application. I somehow managed to get the first screen protector on perfectly without any dust underneath on the first try! Here's how:  Wipe off the screen with the cleaning cloth to get rid of prints and smudges. Don't worry too much about dust right now. Without taking either of the stickers on the protector off, line the screen protector up EXACTLY where you want to put it. Note: as other reviews say, it doesn't sit perfectly flush with the edges, so just be wary of the fact that there will be a tiny gap, so line it up appropriately. Now, when it's positioned, use painter's tape (blue tape) along the TOP edge (the edge with the power button) of the Surface/screen protector to tape down the entire edge. You should be able to touch and pick up the Surface without the screen protector moving at all. Once that is secure, it's time to start worrying about dust. If you have a dusty house or no place to cleanly apply the protector, turn your shower on hot to get some steam in there, to settle dust and prevent more dust from flying up. Once there's some steam, turn the shower off and let things sit for a few minutes (so the Surface screen doesn't fog up). Now, go into your dank and steamy bathroom, and you should be able to flip up the screen protector on the edge you taped on. Use the handy dust stickers to very carefully get any dust/hairs/whatever off the screen. Good lighting is important, and another person may be helpful because this is such a big screen. Once you're positive all the dust is gone, check again. Now, lay the screen protector part of the way back down, but as you do this, start peeling back the sticker on the protector that is against the screen (the one that says Step 1 or something). As you peel, stick it to the screen, and if you have a buddy, keep them on dust duty. That way there is very little time and opportunity for dust to get under there, and you don't have to worry about positioning, since the tape should still be holding it in the right spot. Once everything is stuck, check for dust again under the screen protector. You should be able to lift up a corner (carefully) and get it using the stickers. I live in a house with two dogs and a wife, so there's plenty of dust and hair around here, but I managed to keep all dust out from underneath and get it perfectly aligned on the first try using this method. Remove the painter's tape (again, be careful, because you could pull up the whole protector if you're not careful), and then peel off sticker number 2, pressing down on the protector so you don't pull the whole thing off. Viola! It's a perfect application.  If you're not comfortable with all of this, watch some of Tech Armor's videos. They're helpful. And don't be too afraid to mess up on the first one. Do be afraid to mess up on the second one. If you do screw both of them up beyond repair however, get ahold of Tech Armor.

Even with a huge screen and thickish body, the ZMax is a comfortable fit for average adult hands.  More comfortable than the LG Stylo, which is the same size.

It was with deep regret I sent it in to get a replacement phone. Since I was so very happy with my N95, I spent the money on getting another one. This time, I went for the third generation, with 8G storage built in.  I am not as impressed with the 3rd generation as I was with the first generation. This phone is a lot slower than my old, and lags quite a bit. I also cannot connect it to my Linux laptops like I could with my other. I believe it's because the phone mounts the disk, and it cannot be unmounted. This is probably my biggest problem with this phone. I could do this with the first phone. I have had times when the phone does stupid things like shut itself off. At first I was worried, but the alarm will ring even if the phone is off, so I have reliably used it as an alarm clock when I am on the road.  It's a good phone if you want an all-in-one phone.

You have a hard metal object grading against the glass screen. And that aside, if you don't think that will do it, how about a single grain of sand getting between the metal bar and the screen while it is in your pocket.

The earpiece is very comfortable to use and at many times I find myself placing my hand over my ear to ensure that my device is still attached to my ear. The sound quality of the H710 is outstanding! I have never noticed any ""echo effects"" when using this ear piece and I can hear my callers with crystal clarity. The boom-microphone allows you to swing it open when in use and to swing back to the closed position when not in use.  Although the volume controls on the device are small, one can become easily acquainted with the controls and can manage to turn the volume up or down with ease. One final plus for this device is the built-in power saving mode, which powers the ear piece down when there is no activity and an immediate response when a call is received. This allows battery conservation and less charging.

I will start by saying that I normally do not use plastic screen protectors on my devices cause I have come to really like tempered glass screen protectors for their ability to ""feel"" like real glass and also prevent screen breakage. The only problem with some of the tempered glass screen protectors out there is that they are very thick and add an ugly layer that just does not look right. I decided that I will just go back to the good ol' plastic ones and I was pleasantly surprised by how well these fit my Galaxy S5. The packaging was top notch and included the (3) screen protectors, dust tape and a microfiber cloth. The screen protectors were also protected by a hard paper insert so that the protectors do not get damaged in shipping and that used to be a big issue in the past as I have received many damaged protectors due to the mail man bending them or just damage from handling. I usually get a perfect application by the 2nd screen protector applied, but I had great luck with the fit of the Anker protectors and got it right on my first try and it left ZERO bubbles! I did get a piece of dust trapped underneath but that was easily fixed by using the supplied ""dust tape"" and lifting the protector and re-applying it. The clarity of these are excellent and they feel pretty natural to the touch. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to protect their screen on the S5 and applaud Anker for producing a great quality product. They have never disappointed me! Feel free to ask any questions and I may be able to be of assistance before purchase. I also left a picture so that you can see the applied screen protectir and what the package comes with.

One thing I really like about this wall charger/battery is the fact that you do not need a separate cable to charge this, it goes directly to the outlet. You can either use it as a dedicated usb wall charger or use it as a battery, or both if you want to. I like the fact that these are smart chargers, which means that the output of the charger will match the current that your device can pull. Each port can support up to 2.1 A or 3.4 A overall depending if being used as a wall charger/battery. If your device can only pull 1A then the charger will only supply 1A thus not harming the device.  I have many external batteries and I treat them just as that batteries, I never thought of using them as a wall charger so seeing this device double as a battery and wall charger is pretty cool. The device is small enough to fit in a backpack but its a little bit too big to fit into your pocket, you can do it but it feels uncomfortable.  I used this charger with my Galaxy s4 and 3ds, I can charge and use the devices at the same time without any issues.  One thing that I do not like the motion activated part, you have to shake the device to turn it on. I would have liked an option for turning this device on with a button instead. I usually carry my batteries in a duffle bag and I am constantly moving so this makes me concerned about the battery life because I am constantly turning it on and getting off standby mode. Since I have other external batteries I use this primarily as a wall charger.  I do like the LED indicator on the battery, it has three colors: RED, Green, and BLUE. As it shows on the manual when the LED is red you have about less than 40% charge remaining, Green is less than 70% charge and Blue means the device is fully charged.  As one would expect, the device output is greater when used as a wall charger instead of a battery. When plugged in one can expect an output of 5V @ 3.4 A and when used as a battery the expected output is 5V @ 2.1 A.

By description it charges compatible devices from 0% to 80% in just 35 minutes. And it does, I connected my cellphone, I have application that shows how fast phone charges and it does shows fast charging. In just 40 min it was charged in the range of 80%. (I did killed high power consuming applications first that were running on my phone.) They do not promise fast charge for nothing, to be Quick Charge complaint this charger must charge with this speed.  I don't think this charger is faster than OEM charger, the charger that comes with your phone will charge your phone as fast as this one. This charger probably is better and faster charging, but your phone will not allow faster charge since your phone is designed with one or another standard in mind. But this is very good spare charger, that can be used for travel, office or just as spare charger at home. This charger supports 120 and 220 voltage, so it can be used for international travel. In addition, all new devices are moving to a new Quick Charge 3 standard. That means, even if your phone does not support this charger performance today, your new phone you get tomorrow :) will. But today, even if you do not have QC3 complaint phone, this charger will still work for you since it is backward compatible. Means it does support QC1, QC2, and QC3 standards.  It will charge any device you got, may be not with fast QC3 standard speed, but it will work. Quality of the charger have nothing to do with this fact, your device will prevent faster charging, and charger will not supply higher current to prevent damage to your device.  This charger provides over-voltage and over-current protection and has lifetime warranty! It has small led light that tells you if charger is working, it does helps a lot. Not many charges on the market have this future. One thing you need to know, that performance of any charger will vary from phone to phone. You have many apps installed, and each phone uses power while you charging, so you need subtract usage power to understand how fast your phone is charging.","great charger, I now used it for couple of months and it works like a charm",1461888000,,,know application compatible phone power min prevent performance work small charge apps protection understand charger complaint travel supply market need cellphone product think connect get nothing high office many review allow thing tell addition today over-current powerpeak device description minute mean must oem good range provide international faster charge backward one fact lot wall new application quality future usb help qualcomm good home speed consume quick use probably charge subtract first come high light maxx lead quickcharge mind voltage get lifetime damage standard promise usage still standard spare even fast droid turbo current vary show design run since move work support device adaptive warranty kill over-voltage installed charge another may tomorrow use motorola support

But, for some reason the power switch would not turn this device off - you have to unplug it to turn it off.  I got in contact with the seller Zhou Leon, who promptly replaced this with a new one.  The power switch works fine now...  But, on to the product review.  It works well - you get to plug in 3 devices (and they are spaced out far enough that all 3 plugs can be those wide bricks), AND you also get 4 smart USB ports...  So, with 2 of us travelling, we only needed one converter to charge 2 phones, 2 tablets, BT headphones, and anything else you can throw at it.  We were in Europe, which is the default plug.  But, you also get a US plug, a plug for Asia, and another plug that I have no idea where it's used.  So, when you buy this, you will probably never have to buy another converter - I think it works anywhere you go.  And, with this US plug, it also becomes an extension cord and a 3-plug power strip with 4 USB ports, which I can use at home as well!  BONUS!  :)  Note:  the fan makes some noise when powered on, but not loud enough to keep you awake, in my opinion...

So you pretty much have to live under a rock not to have heard about the various limitations (such as edge halo) of the Samsung Super Amoled screens.  Even so, TechMatte has done a great job of describing the compromises that are inherent in their glass screen protector design.  So I am incredulous of all the 1-star reviews written in the last month.  The S-7 has a very thin bezel.  There are glass screen protectors - like this one - which go all the way to the edge of the screen.  Certain brands of protective cases overlap the bezel, pushing up the edges of this style of screen protector.  To address this, other brands of screen protectors don't go to the edge of the bezel - they are undersized by about 1mm - 2mm.  Buyers need to match the style of screen protector with the style of case.  I have a Spigen Thin Fit that fits perfectly with this screen protector (at least, thus far) and I'm trying out other cases which offer a bit more protection.  This screen protector has adhesive only around the edges.  There's an engineering rationale for this which, as I said, TechMatte explains very thoroughly in their product description.  This design has two limitations:  (a) The screen sensitivity is reduced, requiring longer finger contact, particularly around at the edge of the screen.  As noted by other reviewers, the reduction in screen sensitivity is annoying, but I'm learning to live with it.  (b) The adhesive works as a cushion between the screen protector and the screen - without this cushion in the center, the screen protector is more prone to cracking.  At $9.00, I'm willing to replace my screen protector 2-3 times a year.  Better than the $225 cost to replace the screen.  After 1-1/2 years, it's apparent that the design of the S-7 and the S-8 screens forces compromises on accessory manufacturers.  I understand that I need to put some research time into purchasing accessories if I wish to continue as a loyal Samsung customer (although I admittedly looked at LG this time around).  In the short time I've owned this screen protector, it seems the best all-around compromise... at least for my current needs.","Not perfect, but the best compromise in an S-7 screen protector.",1505865600,3.0,,case inherent finger note contact month reviewer compromise limitation much thoroughly force i've rock samsung longer all-around way customer screen like protection understand say admittedly prone loyal edge hear need describe write product cost compromise glass job time last least replacement manufacturer seem sensitivity protective great incredulous rationale description accessory learn good although purchasing look put adhesive write bezel overlap amoled spigen one offer replace accessory reduction explain annoy cushion buyer engineering reduce far try live own techmatte perfectly fit design require super bit crack protector certain thin month time screen thus various fit particularly match work even edge brand year current willing case short need reviews i'm style galaxy around continue best two without address apparent center halo there's go lg push undersized year research do protector wish pretty review

1280,238221,4,False,"09 23, 2013",A30R8VFR16RE32,B00CIRLJPI,,K.C.,"To be fair to a product like this, one needs to consider that everyone doesn't use their smartphone in the same way that everyone else does.  Smartphones have become an extension of people's lives and therefore create habits that can be as unique as the individual.  I gave this product the good college try, but in the end it doesn't work for me, and how I use my smartphone.  Before I dive in, lets be clear... this product does exactly what it says it does... it provides a wireless charging case and detachable backup battery.  I do not have the wireless mat, so I can only comment on the backup battery, and yes, it works.  In my typical usage of my iPhone, I get about a day's worth of charge, if I am unable to use any of my existing charging locations (home, car, work).  With this product, I got two full days.  However, I could not get past the following: They claim the battery provides the additional capacity ""without the bulk"". Well, that is a stretch.  While I did not get out a ruler, it 'feels' like the thickness of two iPhone 5's stacked on top of each other.  I keep my phone in my pocket, and therefore, the additional thickness was a problem for me.  It may not be a problem for you, if you keep your phone in a bag, fanny pack or purse. (or if you wear cargo shorts). When all is connected, the overall package adds about 1/2 inch to the bottom of the iPhone... which is 'open'.  It's an odd design.  It makes sense from the fact they needed to get the battery to connect to the lightning connector, but it was unexpected for me.  Not a deal breaker as much as the thickness was for me. There is a hole to attach headphones, and I am sure it accommodates the stock Apple headphones just fine, but didn't work for the cable I have in my car.  I had to remove the bottom piece (not fully disassemble) to connect the cable in my car.  This was a drag. Requires a special cable to charge the battery, and therefore the iPhone as well, if they are connected.  It is a standard USB cable, but the end is a 'mini' end or something.  I've seen them before, but if it got lost, I'd likely have to go buy a replacement (as opposed to using the lightning connecter). I will use this system when I know I will be without a charging location for sometime, and keep the backup battery charged and ready for use (say in a backpack or something).  Again, for my personal smartphone habits, I could not use this as a daily 'case' connected at all times, due to additional thickness.  I want to be clear, that I do not have the wireless charging mat.  I am sure that adds a whole additional level of value on this product.  My rating is based on the claims of the product.

I received no other compensation.  All opinions are my own.  I ordered this product because I've been walking around with my Samsung Galaxy S4 protected by nothing other than a tempered glass screen protector.  I've always been careful with my phone because I know I can't afford a new one but this product would make me feel a little more comfortable carrying my phone around.  Yes, I know my phone is a really old model but it's mine and I love it and that's all that matters!  I took this cell phone case out of the packaging and was slightly disappointed by the fact that it didn't come with instructions but no offense to anyone who struggled with this, I feel like a chimp could have figured it out.  I put the case on my phone and it fit perfectly!  I think the fit is great but the case does come out a little bit above the screen in the front.  I assume the company made it like this so if the phone takes a fall it doesn't land directly on it's glass, which is kind of nice.  For someone like me who already has a tempered glass screen protector it is a little unnecessary and slightly irritating but it really doesn't make a difference for me.  I like the ""stand"" feature of this case, which will allow me to place my phone on any flat surface and have it stand up on it's own.  I think this is actually a pretty cool feature, especially if you've got a shutter button for taking pictures away from your phone.  It eliminates the need to buy a tripod for your camera, which saves you money and it's convenient.  Honestly I just wish the stand was a little easier to get out of the cell phone case itself and I think having a button release on it might have been a better idea.  Luckily I've got nails and was able to pry up under it or I really do think I would have had some minor issues with this feature.  Next I checked out the case that the cell phone sits in.  I probably won't use this piece because I don't ever clip my phone on anything, but it's definitely nice to have that option and I will certainly keep it around!  I think it's nice that the phone slides so easily into the clip's cradle.  I think it's a little hard to move the clip around but I guess it would have to be in order to prevent it from flopping around on your belt.  Overall I really think this is a decent case and I'm very pleased to have it.  I think for the amount of protection it gives you the design is stylish and the price is perfect.

Package Contents  Arkon Sports Armband for Large Sized Smart phones   Specifications  Product Dimensions: 9 x 5 x 1.5 inches; 2.4 ounces  Fits mobile devices from 3.7 up to 4.3 screen or 5 in height.   Hardware The armband, as stated in the packaging, is made for larger phones in a 3.3""W x 5.1""L, plastic pouch with a 19 inch black sweat-proof elastic wrap. On the front, the plastic pouch is clear, which is closely stitched to the elastic wrap, and on the back it has one large opening for placing your mobile device or MP3 player, and two smaller openings at the top and bottom for venting the armband and inserting headphones. Inside the pouch is this very soft felt material, which means your device shouldn't be scratched from in or out of the pouch. On the wrap are two ""reflective"" safety straps, which don't seem to reflect well by any means, and two pieces of Velcro to wrap around the strap, and the desired place when it has fit around your arm. Overall, the design of this is very smart, as the only armband you would normally see would be for iPhones, a much smaller device. This will allow almost any device to be used when jogging.   Setup Setup for this is very straight forward.  1. Place your device (and headphones if needed) in the plastic pouch. 2. Place the first Velcro around the strap and the second in desired place around your arm. 3. Congratulations, you are now ready to listen to your music while jogging.   Testing I started testing by placing both my Zune HD, iPod 4th and 5th generation, and iPhone in the plastic pouch, then wrapping the strap around my 11.5 inch arm,. The fit was very comfortable for each device, no matter how big or small it was, and didn't move due to being strapped to my arm. I was able to hear my music comfortably with and without headphones, and my sweat did not seep into the pouch, despite jogging for a few hours. I was overall satisfied by the function and fit of this armband.   Final Thoughts Due to this device's functionality and comfortable fit, I recommend anyone who is looking for an armband for large (and small) mobile devices, and is why I am giving this product a 5 star rating. I am very happy with this product.

What you see is what you get; a plastic sticky screen that will protect an iPhone 6 from scratching or other potential damage. It won't protect your phone from cracking if it takes a hard hit on concrete. You need a bumper or extremely durable case to do that. However, if you want to keep the screen clean of scratches this is it. The positives are it does the job, it offers a clear image and doesn't obscure the screen image. The negative I'd primarily that this screen (and every other screen I have ever installed) is that installation can be tricky. My best advice is do the application in a dust free area, make sure the screen is both dust, dirt, and grease free and proceed slowly as you follow the instructions while aligning the screen to the phone's face and then carefully remove any bubbles. Ultimately, if you goof up my advice is try again since three screens are provided.

Together, the kids and I opened the box and brought everything out and put them in order so we could go step-by-step and put it together.  I want to say it took about 2 hours to put together.  It ended up being a lot bigger than I expected, but I love how it works.  Everything goes together pretty well.  I only had trouble with one of the hinges (which just gets hammered into the door - I might go back and add multi-purpose glue as I sort of had to force it out as it went in crooked, as a result, the particle board door cracked on the back around the hinge just a bit.  So far it is holding strongly though), and it took about 2 hours to put together.  The back goes on and has a split for you to feed a cord through if you want to put any electronics inside (great for laptop storage when not in use).  The moving top is the neatest part.  You can store unused charging cables inside, and it has a power bar that you can use to charge multiple items at the same time.  I may upgrade the power bar myself as it is small, and most of my chargers take up 1 1/2 of the spaces when plugged in, so I can only keep about 3 plugged in at any one time.  If I get one with the plugs a bit farther apart it will be able to charge more at the same time.  I will say that I was skeptical as to how much it would get used, but it has ended up becoming a hub in our house for Kindles, phones and other gadgets needing to be charged.

The cut-outs are all the right size and lined up correctly. The hole around the fingerprint sensor is also completely fine. I scanned my fingerprint after putting the case on, and use the sensor all the time to unlock my phone.  The magnets are super helpful for keeping the case closed. My last case didn't have magnets for this but it wasn't a problem, so even if these ever failed it'd still be a good case. But again - they do work and go a great job of keeping the case closed, and of holding the cover in a folded-back position against the back of the phone when I've got it open. Really appreciate this feature.  The phone doesn't stay upright very well if I try to use the ""kickstand"" feature of the cover - it slides back into place and falls closed - but it feels like if I keep folding that middle seam along the back that it'd soften and stay open better with time. I never use that feature with any of my phones, however, and would prefer a case without it since I don't use it and it just flaps around in various positions I may hold it in when trying to take pictures, so I will most likely not test out the case's ability to become more flexible for kickstand use. I'm sure if you try it, though, it'll eventually stand for you.  I haven't put anything in the card slot yet so I don't know how much that will impact the case staying closed, but since it's just one card slot I won't really plan on using it for anything more than maybe a thing slip of paper with my contact info on it to facilitate returns if I lose my phone.

Had many of their past headsets with pretty good experiences. After my Discovery 975 recently crapped out on me I was in the market for a replacement. I liked the small form factor of this but wasn't crazy about the price tag. After some hunting around and patiently waiting for Amazon to drop the price a bit (which never happened unfortunately) I ended up picking it up from Verizon because I carry a 25% off discount on all accessories on my Verizon account. Ended up picking it up for $93 out the door!  Now I use it daily on my commute from home to work and back again. It's great because it's completely hands free except for when you want to ""hang up"" (then you just press the side of the headset). The sound is extraordinary compared to my past headsets. And better yet, you can even download the latest apps from plantronics to check your battery status and find your headset if you lose it by gps tracking! Don't forget the NFC pairing! It's very convenient :)  The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel like the little silicon earpiece isn't the most secure way of attaching it to my ear. The loop works great! However, you have to disconnect it (not particularly easy) each time you want to put the headset back in it's case. So doing this several times a day is not preferred. Wish they could incorporate the loop (maybe a different or smaller design of some sort) into the case so it could stay on at all times. I realize the shape would have to be changed, but that's why I'm suggesting a different designed loop possibly.  Otherwise the headset itself is 5 stars.

For one thing I had two trailers to try it out on. One was a friend of mine who just bought property in a desolate, hilly area where the only signal he could get was standing on a picnic table at one spot only. Move away and it was gone. We quickly hoisted up the outside antenna on a 10 foot piece of PVC and pointed it in the general direction where I knew the map showed an antenna. We ran 60 feel of cable into his brand new metal barn and set up the rest without really knowing much other then we wanted 4 green lights. Within minutes he started floating 4 to 5 bars from inside his metal barn. (newly constructed) He stepped back 20 feet and still had 3 bars and made a call. He was also able to get color weather radar on this signal although I believe it was only 2G. He was shocked so he's ordering one up.  For my camper I eventually got down to it and it had a tiny bit better reception. (There was one corner of the camper where if you sat on one of the sliders where it went out you could get one bar of 2G.) I hooked the outside antenna up to the ladder on the back of the camper that also faced almost directly at a tower that was about 5 miles (I measured this later and just updated it.) off through some serious hills. Most everyone up there has Verizon and I had a T-Mobile phone. It immediately got up to 5 bars but it was 2G. I guess I'll be really impressed once they expand their network. I did have my old Verizon IPhone 4S and it did get 5 bars of 3G as it isn't an LTE phone. (Tower isn't but about a quarter mile away from the tower I was aiming at.  All in all I was shocked at how well this product worked. If you have questionable signal but you have some signal this thing will finish it off for you. You'll be very happy you bought it. From reading about this product it is apparently geared toward using your 75 ohm system that comes in most homes for Dish and cable. That will save you money when buying the lightning arrestors as Wilson wants $79 for the 50 ohm model and you can buy a 75 ohm one on Amazon for under $20.

Its 3"" wide and 6"" tall. I struggle to find a selfie stick that would open up wide enough to hold my phone and then I struggle with a selfie stick that doesn't fall over because my phone is so heavy! The fact that I couldn't find one that worked made me want to buy a smaller phone. Lol.  Selfie sticks can range in price from $4-30. I have both ends of the spectrum, and although this one is pricy I say its worth the investment. I have a flimsy one that had the problem with my phone being too heavy for the neck of the selfie stick so when you extend it completely and raise it up, the phone flips over. My other selfie stick is heavy duty and that holds the phone in place fine, but its almost 15"" folded up! You can't fit that in a purse! That leads me to why I love this one.  -Extends very long but only folds up to 7"". After it is folded up, it fits in any purse! Very small and compact -Fewer moving parts on the head. There is only one joint really so you don't have to worry about tightening up 2 or 3 different areas to secure your phone. -Folds into itself. The groove on the head, where you attach the phone is shaped so that once you fold that head down, it snugs up on the pole itself and doesn't take up any extra space. Great design! -Button to snap pic is on stick. My other selfie stick had a separate remote to snap pics, and I'd always have the stick but lose the remote. -Plug and use, not bluetooth. I love how you just plug the 3.5mm head into your headphone jack and you're ready to go. My other selfie stick was bluetooth remote required you do connect bluetooth every time. -Lightweight. My other selfie stick that was very sturdy did hold my phone securely but was so heavy itself, I couldn't hold it up with one hand with the addition of my phone!

It was a good case overall, but the snap-on design left the top and bottom of the iPhone 5's aluminum bezel exposed, which was then susceptible to unsightly scratches and wear, even with gentle handling (this is a critique of the iPhone design, not the case, and is more a cosmetic niggle than a real functional issue).  I've found that the full wraparound design of the glide case fully covers the aluminum bezel (both concealing scratches already present and protecting against future wear), while retaining the slim profile, understated design, and soft-touch grip that I liked so much about the breathe.  However, the case isn't perfect. The cutout for the headphone port is a bit too small for use with bulkier jacks. There are some raised seams along the sides from the molding process and the bottom piece doesn't fit perfectly flush with the rest of the case. Finally, despite the soft-touch finish, this case is still a bit more slippery in the hand than i'd prefer. However, it is still light years better than trying to operate the naked iPhone.  Like I mentioned in my elago breathe review, these types of cases are not flak jackets for your smartphone. However, if you're careful with your gadgets and need a classy, low-profile case, these are a great option.","Not perfect, but pretty good for its intended purpose",1361232000,,,case seam protect cosmetic much slippery i've use hand type glide like unsightly however prefer cover gadget need perfect wear headphone elago bulky i'd raise careful great already real snap-on better purchasing find breathe left critique gentle handle finish bezel retain despite liked issue understate future operate smartphone option try mention good soft-touch iphone perfectly expose side fit design bit light full classy fully jack naked conceal present top profile flak wraparound still finally even port aluminum functional niggle cutout low-profile rest bottom year mold buy case process piece overall scratch along slim susceptible flush jacket grip small review

The packaging is way too much for this ear piece but i'm sure its to keep it from getting stolen off store shelves. The hard plastic packaging has two chambers, one is the ear piece and the other is the plug. The ear piece has 3 ear fittings, I had to use the large to keep it from falling out. The style is like Uhura from Star Trek but it also comes with the hook for over the ear for extra protection from it falling out.  I like the on/off switch. Many others out there you have to hold the same button that makes calls etc and i've always held it too long making go into pairing mode. There's a volume button on the top that has 3 settings of low, med, high. The main body has two buttons that you can't see but each end is a hidden button. This was my only complaint as naturally you easily want to click the front button and that is the voice recognition button not the call answer hang up button. Once you remember and become comfortable with that it becomes easier.  The voice recognition is kinda cool in that it does specific tasks with your voice, now this isn't something new but this earpiece can answer or ignore your call just by saying ""Answer/Ignore"". Which makes it totally hands free. You can also ask to check the battery, redial, get 411 info and also has a Vocalyst feature that lets you get your email, post Twitter messages and check news and weather. I haven't tried out this feature because you need to sign up online using the 1year free service.  The sound which is the most important feature in my opinion is pretty good. Its not the best but not the worst. Its clear but slightly sounds digitized, although if you think about it its wireless and that's how it works it digitizes the voice from the phone to the ear piece.  Pairing it was the easiest I have ever done and I've owned about 5 earpieces. It also has 3 microphones to make sure your voice is picked up well and I can say that it seemed to do its job. I spoke slow and sometimes not as clear but it was picked up on the other end.  It says 4 hrs talk time and 7 hrs stand by but its too early to tell this although most likely it will be about that as i've again, owned many earpieces and most of them are true to battery life. This also comes with a small pouch for traveling to keep your plug and earpiece secure.

The phone started to overheat to the point I feared my house might burn down one night, and when I couldn't get another Lumia 521 I figured I would maybe make the switch to an android to take advantage of all the apps that are made for android and iphone users which never seem to cover Windows.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Player for listening to music and found a Samsung Avant phone that was a good size to fit in my pocket, so figured I would ""upgrade"".  What a mistake.  That phone was so frustrating.  Because my Lumia 521 was ""cheap"" I had been fooled into thinking it was not as good a phone - but it turned out it was actually better.  I am not one to quickly replace a phone, but after a month of frustration I couldn't stand it and researched to see what would be a good Nokia phone that might be a good size to fit in my pocket with a slightly better camera than the 521.  After careful research I settled on the 820 and so far am pretty glad I did.  It is not perfect, but it meets most of my checklist and all of my high priority items.  First - I have difficulties getting phones, tablets, etc.. to respond to my touch.  Apparently my fingers just aren't recognized.  So with the Samsung I would have to swipe 3 or 4 times to get it to work.  With the Lumia's it recognizes my touch -every time.  I have seen demonstrations of people using them with gloves and they work fine.  So whatever that technology might be - it is a great feature and number one in reducing my frustrations.  Second, they have a great texting autocorrect.  Once you learn to just plow ahead with your incorrect spelling and have faith that one second later the autocorrect will fix it to the right word, you will be in heaven.  With the Samsung, the autocorrect was nightmarish.  I would have the whole word correct except perhaps the last letter.  The Samsung autocorrect would split what I had typed into 3 nonsensical separate words.  The time it would take to fix the autocorrect was not worth it and I had to turn it off.  Third, I like a microSD card option.  The 820 allows for a microSD card - so I know that I can save my pictures, etc., and easily be able to download them or transfer, etc.. The Windows account already backs them up, but it is nice to know that I can have all this extra memory AND just move the card over to a new phone, etc..  Plus, I figure if I do something stupid to my phone, as long as the SD card doesn't get crushed and I can get it out, then I can save all my photos.  Fourth, there is a replaceable battery.  I cannot understand a phone that wouldn't let you change the battery for a new one once it starts to fail.  Fifth, the navigation.  The Windows navigation just makes so much more sense.  With my Samsung, my teenage daughters would be asking me how to get back to a previous text, etc..  You know a phone is counter intuitive when a teenager needs help using it.  I would like to additionally have got a much better camera, but so far the pictures I have taken are just as crummy as the ones on the 521.  I now have a flash, which is a good thing, but the camera is still not great.  Probably my main knock against it.  Another requirement I had is a phone approximately the size of an iPhone so that I can fit it in my pocket.  This phone is a really nice size so it scores high for its nice size.  If you've never used a windows phone you'll fine the tiles are a really nice feature - I really missed them when I had the Samsung phone.  One thing you'll want to keep in mind - and this could be important - is that the phone I got is an AT&T phone.  I use T-mobile so this was both good and bad.  It was good because for some reason unknown to me, but which I had stumbled upon during my research, only the AT&T branded phones are able to upgrade to Windows 8.1 which has Cortana.  The T-Mobile phones are not allowed to upgrade.  Apparently upgrades are actually at the discretion of the carrier, and T-mobile doesn't allow it on this phone.  So what I did was when I first got the phone, I started it up without a SIM card in it and connected to the wifi.  After being connected a little while to the wifi it told me there was an update to 8.1 available for my phone.  So I updated it while it thought it was AT&T.  I then had to get online and request the unlock code from AT&T .  It was easy enough to do and I got the code pretty much right away (it gives you a link to check the status of your request, so I checked that link immediately and my code was right there).  However, it does say it could take several days (I think it said up to 5 days) so if you are planning to use your phone right away on T-mobile and AT&T decides to take a long time to give you the unlock code you may be out of luck.  So you would think all is well and good but then I realized - and researched - that because this is an AT&T branded phone, I could not get the T-mobile function of making calls over wifi.  Apparently that function is a T-mobile specific function that only comes on T-mobile phones.  Because I really have only used that function once in the last year, I would rather have Windows 8.1 and Cortana, so I am just as happy that this is an AT&T phone.  But you'll have to decide for yourself if that is a problem or not.  There may be some other T-Mobile specific functionality that I am now missing but so far I have not stumbled on any.  Now I just hope that this one doesn't overheat like my 521 did, because I plan to keep this phone for a good long time.",so happy,1438214400,,,player internet think maybe update apps understand phone nonsensical say glad start figure fine actually one at&t time last turn get upgrade thing allow making later teenager stupid happy really heaven turn check sim right point let frustrate far fear quickly crush cheap would bad carrier sd ahead easily checklist main plus text pocket without previously year tell every may overheat camera know mistake give phone away house move much think like extra request could start might connect user realize finger unlock several photo discretion spell problem careful technology well size burn long additionally hope see demonstration upon one new priority whatever memory make account fool unknown whole replaceable option give t-mobile meet worth day first item awhile help time crummy call android tile call etc still link see need galaxy status nightmarish correct allow use save planning picture rather second code nice navigation type difficulty use work fix samsung recognize fail however download decide think night battery counter important luck enough brand take change faith slightly third research texting lumia intuitive find music word little recognizes meet back back sense separate able good approximately allow use online fit respond come mind perhaps get split background check mainly plan score upgrades occasional reduce make settle knock word autocorrect previous specific avant well research say another stand lumia's month apparently email ask feature stumble immediately wifi perfect function high frustration something great already take fourth tablet letter frustration glove miss replace touch window incorrect functionality reason nokia iphone probably card transfer update flash number plow cannot want learn listen switch microsd fifth miss figure advantage easy except check never teenage cover cortana seem make people available decide get daughter requirement keep pretty swipe

From the picture and the description on the listing, I was expecting a case with clear protective backing and a purple colored bezel bumper. I love purple so I was excited to find a case with a purple bumper. When I got the clear case with purple tint instead, I was disappointed. I don't feel they are using a case that matches their description fully. They said the front bumpers are raised slightly above the screen to protect but honestly, from my perspective, the front bumper will not protect my screen at all. I can feel the side of my glass screen protector and the edge of my phone.  The case I received is a gel clear case with a purple tint that fit on to iPhone 6/6s well. It doesn't make your phone feel bulky with the case on. It's slim but durable. It's easy to press the power or the volume button. The headphone jack is protected by the case but not the charging port. The case is anti-slip and scratch resistant. It also comes with free screen protector. I believe it is a PET flimsy protector.

Unfortunately, the included ear pads weren't a good fit for my ear.  I ended up using a spare ear pad left over from a different BT headset (Jawbone Icon) that I lost years ago.  That aside, this headset is affordable and works well.  Once you have it paired with a device, it will connect automagically as soon as you turn it on (provided the Bluetooth adapter on the other device is any good).  Range is adequate, pretty much the 10 m (around 30 feet) normally expected of a Class 2 Bluetooth device.  Sound quality is good.  I've never had anyone complain they couldn't hear me well, except in some cases where I had just connected the H17 to two devices simultaneously (see below).  Some limitations: You can only pair the H17 to two other Bluetooth devices.  I have a phone and two computers, all with Bluetooth capability, so for making VoIP calls I had to choose whether I wanted to pair it with the desktop or the laptop.  Speaking of which, it works great for doing VoIP on a PC.  My Bluetooth adapters are both Cirago BTA-3210's.  I've used the H17 paired with this adapter to do numerous Google Voice calls, as well as other VoIP applications (Viber etc.).  It's handy for saving one's cellular voice minutes when needing to make calls at home.  The H17 seems to have severely limited processing power.  Often, when I connect it to both my phone and a computer simultaneously, the sound is extremely distorted for a minute or so.  It seems that the H17 needs a short period to adjust itself to being doubly-connected, after which it works fine.  Don't expect to listen to music through this.  It is one-ear-only, and sound quality is acceptable for voice, but atrocious for anything else.  If you want to listen to music, you'll have to pony up for a stereo Bluetooth headset.","Actually works, though not perfect",1388534400,,,simultaneously case application adapter doubly-connected phone power limitation much connect find i've break need pad automagically save extremely process handy fine useful connect listen normally anyone expect pc seem great make ear different device minute want headset range unfortunately leave severely music stereo pair include icon turn quality complain aside computer foot soon good lose home limit use end fit desktop whether minute want google pony would call hear distort pad adequate etc ago speak anyway spare work figure see voip laptop voice period else year except cirago cellular adapter sound numerous provide one's choose jawbone make class never short need atrocious bluetooth around two often one-ear-only bt capability device adjust acceptable use well loop expect computer viber affordable anything pair pretty

Unfortunately, no padded (like silicone or rubber or whatever) exterior case can be used if you are using the belt clip, but I use it all the time in the clip, so it's awesome anyway.

I really hated taking them apart to put in a fresh battery and after a while the hard plastic would crack at the stylus opening and then run.  I have always liked this style case but  some said the magnets interfere with the phone. Other cases did not protect the corners. My hard case was cracking again and I began reading the reviews. After I read that the magnetic catch was strong but did not interfere with the phone, I looked at the pictures and saw that it does cover the corners. I decided to take a chance. The only possible criticism is that there is not a flap to cover the charger opening for those who drop their phones in the wash or toilet. That is it. Phone is held securely, the bright fuschia makes it easy to find in my large purse and battery life is much better as the flap comes out a little past the phone. No turning on with every bump.

Also, it will stand up with a charge cable plugged in and your iPhone will fit in the stand even if you have your phone in a protective case. The rubber mount stretches! So, on my desk or side table, I have my iPhone (in its case) standing up and charging. When it rings, I answer on speakerphone and the booster directs my caller's voice right at me, instead of all around the room.

There was a small tussle over ""air time PIN"" for which I had to call tracfone tech support, but buying time from the tracfone web site solved that.  Several people have complained about the nearly instant phone lock out time. It can be changed, but the way of doing it is not in the manual, as one person wrote. However - a web search showed me the way. On the phone's main screen, tap the ""dice key"" at lower right, then on the next screen up, tap the ""Settings"" key at lower right. From there, tap ""Phone"", and then ""Auto-lock"". In Auto Lock, choose the setting you can live with. I set mine to ""Never"" for the time being, but there's a danger of the phone ""pocket dialing"" (dialing a phone number because of pressure on it while it's in your pocket or its case) so you may want to choose 10, 20, 30, or 60 seconds.  This leads to the second thing I want to say here - almost any question you might have about the phone can be answered by a Google search - so use that liberally, if you need to. There are also quite a few very good tutorials on the phone, at [...]  The final thing I want to say is that this phone seems to share the same network of cell towers with the very expensive Verizon ""smart phone"" I'm escaping from. So for about $8-10 per month, I'll get most of the features of the $80 monthly Verizon deal. For a home user who doesn't download movies or play games on the phone, that's an excellent deal.  ADDED AFTER TWO WEEKS of owning and using the phone - still 5 stars, maybe more. The phone is much more versatile and useable than I expected. Most of the things which have bothered other reviewers are just matters of getting used to the interface. Texting, voice messaging, and of course phone calls are all simple and quick. Browsing is fast enough for casual use and the cost, in terms of ""minutes"", is very reasonable. I can view and use my Google calendar, so the Calendar is sybched across all my computers and other devices. I haven't yet figured out how to view my Google contacts, but I think that's possible.

Design: Anker has been fantastic in all their products and this one is no exception. Minimalist yet simply elegant. The powerport has a soft touch finish on it except for the port area which is piano black. Anker is like Apple of the peripheral world when it comes to simplicity of design. The powerport is only about the size of a credit card. The packaging box is almost double its size.  Build quality: Outstanding. The charger does not feel flimsy in hand. Extremely good build quality. There were no blemishes or defects of any kind  Performance: So far I have charged my HTC One M8 and Galaxy Tab S side by side with it and had no issues. Device got warm but nothing out of the ordinary.  Areas for improvement: These are extremely subjective - some sort of rubber feet or pad to stop it from sliding on smooth surfaces.

I needed a more rugged, protective case for when I was out doing things where I'd be more likely to drop my phone and need protection (hiking, etc). This particular one has a soft, cushion-y ""skin"" and then a harder part that clips on to give it like an exoskeleton. The combination of the two give it a hefty feel, without adding actual bulk or too much weight. I REALLY love that the softer part is grippy and doesn't let the phone slide around when set on a smooth surface. The button covers are responsive and I don't have to press too hard or overcompensate for not being able to feel the actual buttons, themselves. The cherry on top for this case is the fact that it comes with a color-matched stylus (which works well and has a clip on top so you can attach it to stuff like a pen), a microfiber cleaning cloth (again, works really well, very soft) and a screen protector for the touchscreen. I haven't used that bit because I already have one on my phone that's been working well, but if it ever needs replacing, I'll try this one and update my review.

One good volley ball to the phone or basketball and it would be toast.  UAG is a fantastic product but they were not available until after our family vacation.

It has the benefits of a smaller compact charger as well as having the nice touches that make it user-friendly.  The 1A output delivered just about 1% per minute on my two charging sessions. I ended up recharging for 120 minutes overall, and the four LED power display lights still had two lit up (meaning 25% to 50% charge left). Based on that performance, I could get two full charges on my phone before I'd absolutely have to recharge the battery. That's good performance from a nice compact unit. When I recharged it, I admit I lost track of the time it took to get back up to a full charge. But I *do* know it was less than some of the other units I've used lately.  I like the fact that this unit has the multiple LED display for power left, as it gives me an idea of what I still have left before recharging. It also has a built-in flashlight, which is a handy feature if you carry it around in a purse or backpack.

1877,275340,4,False,"03 16, 2014",A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,B00E2YI052,,RatherLiveInKeyWest,"This OXA external battery charger is priced well as compared to others in its 2600mAh capacity range, seems well constructed (uses a Samsung cell, which has a reputation as being the best), and is of a very convenient and portable size. At just four inches long by one inch wide & high, and only weighing 2.5 ounces, this backup battery is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack.  This external battery comes with a cord that has a fitted end, allowing its four adapters to be exchanged as needed. My son and I tested these adapters using multiple devices and had much success as summarized below.  Packaging was simple - a form-fitting plastic tray with the accessories wrapped in their own plastic bag - and it was easy to open. If you would like to see pictures I took of it, please navigate to the battery pack's main sales page, scroll down to where the ""Most Helpful Customer Reviews"" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the ""Product Images From Customers"" section.  Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my Samsung S3's wall adapter) and a red light came on; the User Manual indicates that the red light means the unit is charging, and that the red light goes out once the unit is fully charged. We let the battery charge until the red light went out, which took about 4 hours to complete. This device does not have a digital display to keep you informed of its power level, unlike its outstanding bigger brother the OXA S2 100000mAh battery, and I did miss having that display.  Just like the bigger OXA S2 unit, operating this battery is a breeze -- just plug it in to charge the battery pack, then when you need it you just connect your device to the port with the USB cable and proper fitting or with your device's USB cable. We tested both ways and had no issues at all with connectivity; once connected and charging a device, a blue light comes on to let you know that charging is proceeding.  The storage capacity of this battery is 2600mAh which is perfect for a quick boost but it not for multiple charging use without recharging. It is just right to help out in emergencies, and the charging times we experienced were good; on average, it charged our units at a rate of about 3/4 percent per minute, or about 45% recharging per hour from its 5V/1A USB output port.  We tested this power bank with a Samsung S4, HTC Droid DNA, Samsung S3 and an iPhone 5C... and a typical example was when the Samsung S4 was boosted from 1% to 61% in about 80 minutes. One curiosity; the backup battery has a 2600mAh rating and the Samsung S4 has a 2600mAh Samsung battery, but the fully charged backup was only able to charge the S4 to 61% before being depleted. This may reflect that it was only on the power bank's third or fourth cycle and the load may move towards full capacity after a longer break-in period. We did not experience this with other devices we charged.  The phones did get a little warm during the charging process, but no warmer than if put on its own charger, and the battery pack did get a little warm too -- but nothing odd or unusual at all. The unit's micro fittings worked fine in all phones that we tried, and the regular USB charging cables that came with the phones all connected perfectly with the battery pack too.  This battery is very easy to use... and that's good, because its ""User Manual"" is small and written in severely broken English -- to the point of being very comical. OXA staff already replied to my inquiry noting that they are working to improve the manual, and I feel that their responsiveness and customer service philosophy is outstanding. However, I must share this one line with you from the back of the box: ""Warming: do not follow these instructions. may cause a fire, electric shock damage or other damage."" I am sure that this meant to start ""Warning: Failure to follow these instructions....""  The title of the item on the Amazon sales page includes ""18M WTY"" which seems to infer that OXA provides an 18 month warranty; there is no further mention of the warranty on the item's box or ""User Manual"". If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.  Affordable, portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer.  If you are looking a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then I recommend it.

For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it."" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most interested in comparing it to, especially the Note 3 that it replaces, the iPhone 6 Plus, the LG G3 since it shares more than a few similarities, and even the new upcoming Note 4 Edge.  Physical:  * The Note 4 is basically a Note 3 - if you've held one before, then you'll feel right at home. It's just a smidge taller, narrower, thicker, and heavier. But the main thing you'll notice is the design difference. Looking at it straight down onto the screen side, you might not notice much, but set it down and view it on all sides and you'll see a much better difference. It's like having a same car but the 2015 version over the 2014 version - at first you don't see any difference, until you go up close and realize the little things that make it really stand out. First of all, Samsung has finally paid attention to its best aesthetic competitor HTC, and followed suit with a real aluminum metal chamfered edges, and not the fake aluminum of the Note 3. It looks great. View it from the top and bottom edges, and you'll see an even more striking design change and upgrade. View it from the top edge especially and you'll see what I mean. Here is the first Samsung with truly beautiful edges - I would have never thought I would say that!  *The very next thing you'll notice once you turn it on is the screen. the LG G3 was the first QHD screen for America from a big company, but I can say that Samsung's AMOLED has come a long way, and is now the best on the market. The color gamut, saturation, contrast and black levels have always been great, but Samsung has also come a long way in terms of color reproduction, and especially making the screen still looking great in direct sunlight - it's only been two years since the Note 2, but Samsung has made amazing progress. QHD means 2560 x 1440 resolution - 515 ppi - and Samsung's is the brightest, clearest, and best screen on the planet right now.  *Other notable improvements are: - Processor: upgraded Exynos and Snapdragon processors depending on where you buy it, upgrade GPU for you gaming aficionados. The Note 3 was one of the fastest and most powerful for its time, and is still one of the fastest phones right now(!), and yet the Note 4 is even faster! Swiping through screens, switching between apps, running a dozen apps, playing processing-intensive games, they all feel like a breeze. - Upgraded cameras: 16MP on the back, 3.7MP on the front(instead of 13MP and 2MP). You can now record video in 4K mode! - The pen/stylus is now made by Wacom, the famous stylus maker. Hardware and software improvements have made it more usable than ever. - Samsung got rid of the USB 3 charging port of the Note 3 in favor of the more universal mini-USB 2, but improvements have made it possible to charge the battery from 0%-50% in 30 minutes. The battery is 3220mAh, up from 3200 in the Note 3. Both will get you through a whole day of moderate usage with a bunch to spare. I've never had it lower than 20% remaining using it from 10am-10pm with moderate to heavy usage. What you should know if you didn't already is that the screen uses the most battery. Keep leaving it on and it will drain fast, especially if you're playing a game. Other big battery hogs are leaving your GPS radio on - even if you are not actively using it - and apps that continually access your phone - like if you set your email to instant retrieval instead of every few hours.  By itself, this phone is a beast in many senses of the word. But how does it compare with the other phones, and is it a worthy buy or upgrade?  In comparison with the iPhone 6 Plus: If you want a giant phone, the iPhone 6 Plus is a very intriguing option. If you're an Apple person, you're going to get this phone, that's just the truth. It has a beautiful 1080p screen(a very first for Apple), it's fast, and finally Apple has a phone that all Apple lovers who have been craving for a huge phone to have. The Apple ecosystem is still superior in terms of apps and userability. On the other hand, if you like Samsung, then you should absolutely get the Note 4. Samsung now has an almost perfect big phone, and each phone from now on will only get better. You will never regret getting this phone. If you're in the neutral, then it depends on your lifestyle. If you just want a big phone for everyday use, I personally think it's easier to use Apple phones. Everything is just right there - the learning curve is not very steep(until you get into iTunes and want to export stuff, but that's another issue). But if you want more control over your phone and you're more tech savvy, there is nothing better than the Android ecosystem - it has the best of all worlds, and for those more tech savvy, it's actually easier to use than Apple phones. As a user of both ecosystems, I can attest to this personally.  In comparison with the LG G3: I wanted to include the G3 because both share the QHD-resolution screens. But the G3 is more compact, having smaller bezels and a smaller 5.5"" screen. So if you still want a big phone, but feel the Note phones were just a tad too big, then the G3 has that perfect combination. It also has one of the best screens on the market, in LCD form, has a beautiful design, and the LG quality.  In comparison with the Note 4 Edge: Personally for me, there is no comparison - I'm going to get and use the Note 4 Edge as my main phone. It has a smaller 5.6"" screen, but that curve and design makes it oh so unique - it's the most unique and best-looking phone for me by far. Some will complain that with that form factor it will be very hard to have a case that can fully protect it, but so I will just be extra careful with it.  In comparison with the Note 3: This might be most important comparison, because you own a Note 3. Moving from the Note 2 to Note 3 was easy for me, because my Not 2 had performance issues that my Note 3 doesn't(it would slow to a crawl when too many apps are installed/used, and when your text history is too large texting crawls to a stand still), plus the 1080p screen on the Note 3 is 10x better than the 720p Note 2's, not in just resolution, but brightness, color reproduction, sun-light legibility, etc. The differences from the Note 3 to the Note 4 is less pronounced, since at this size QHD over FHD resolution is not so pronounced - although if you put them side by side you will notice the difference. My advice is, if you resell your Note 3, then absolutely upgrade to the Note 4. If you can't, or can't upgrade and have to buy the Note 4 at full price, then I would say to wait until the Note 5. Or do what I will do, and get the Note 4 Edge.  By itself, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is a definite recommendation. As an upgrade, it is still highly recommended, with caveats. I will add to the review once I have used it more.  ***Also note, that with these international versions, you might not get the best LTE/4G speeds, because that more depends on the country where you live/travel to and their telecom providers than the phone itself - although the Note 4 has one of the most complete sets of radio bands of any phone out there. Check the specs, and then research the telecom providers of your country/country of visit.",A Nearly Perfect Big Phone - But Is It A Worthy Upgrade Over Your Phone?,1413504000,22.0,,gps regret i've performance onto realize notice apps ever phone powerful factor slow market edge worthy actually resolution bezel strike sun-light snapdragon software get replaces upgrade many thing lcd userability direct make ecosystems stylus oh learn superior live/travel charge really turn usb pen/stylus right possible far suit notable savvy easy home run-over version swipe stuff almost version screen highly processing-intensive would metal everything visit overview small finally port clearest giant include specification main plus text definite run set two mean go hardware note every qhd-resolution review smidge know phone hard black much view radio person think fake like wacom extra maker come america might itunes can't nothing wait curve careful bright color unique well size narrower long gamut technical amoled favor one ecosystem personally upgrade best-looking new term crawl complain resell make dozen whole option sunlight compare company front(instead access first gpu band time game difference android history top issue buy etc general also game switch still attention spare similarity see edges physical user universal bottom country/country year taller brightness side case play galaxy since competitor yet export breeze comparison heavy pay use always crawl lifestyle recommendation lower mini-usb caveat hold apple heavier instant ppi protect hand use samsung world country hour qhd processor compact think professional next battery tech important change big everyday leave contrast mean want texting advice camera crave le although huge tad word little fast thing set back quality intriguing beautiful quick use side design game google get thick share check level truth close usage steep(until aluminum form fast chamfer make htc car i'm best combination move planet installed/used bunch research say charge another difference look control stand look retrieval email usable fast aesthetic way rid telecom screen upcoming depend straight drain share depend add perfect legibility reproduction provider video mode compare beast recommend great already amaze processor feel real minute interested remain neutral international put moderate record that's issue fhd efficient follow go pronounce iphone large truly price aficionado want full samsung's fully especially hogs saturation continually screen(a complete lover attest even easy day basically actively sense doesn't(it exynos specs never review progress instead make famous lg get us keep absolutely improvement speed

I don't want my phone to look like a jelly bean or a rainbow or a piece of junk.  I want something rugged.  (my previous favorite for my iPhone was a case by Magpul).  This case really met my expectations.  The extra bulk is minimal for the level of protection it provides.  It's very easy to install and remove, but the fit is plenty of tight - there is no wiggle room.  The buttons on the side are crisp and responsive.  The case does not seem to interfere with the camera.  There is enough lip on the front to allow the phone to be laid face down without scratching it.

I hoped these might be the ones, but I'm sad to say, they hurt my ears. I just couldn't find a comfortable way to fit them in. Although, every so often I could get them just right and wear them for a little while. I tried the alternate way of wearing them mentioned in the directions where they hook over and around the top of the ear but that didn't help.  However, Admittedly, my ears are smaller than most people's. If you have larger ears and you can wear the earphones that come with an iPod, you'll find these similar in fit. Having the switch on the line is nice for stopping and starting your music while you are listening.  I wasn't really able to try out the microphone feature on the headphones. My iPod has a built in external mic, so that picked up the sound by default when I tried these for facetime chat. And my computer has a built-in mic too, so when I tried using them on Skype with my laptop, the computer picked up the sound externally, not on the mic. I don't have a phone that fits this size headphones to try them out on to see how they work for connecting and disconnecting phone calls with the line switch. When wearing the headphones in the over-ear position, the mic is up near the ear lobe, so I don't know how well it would pick up anyway.  There are some big pluses about these headphones. The sound quality is very good and they have a very full sound. I could hear guitar fret noise on one song that was extremely clear and precise. The cord looks sturdy and well made (feels like rubber, but they call it a cloth cord). The info says they are tangle free, but mine still get tangled up, although, they untangle pretty easy. And like I said, he switch in the line is nice. You can turn your music on and off with one click right on the headphones if someone comes by and asks a question while you're listening. A double click on the switch advances to the next song. A cool feature.  Because of the poor fit, I can't see wearing these while biking. They just don't stay in my ears well enough. I did discover one trick though. To get them to fit, I had to treat my ears like a notch and slide the ear bud from the top of my ear down into place.

This one is almost identical to the ""Spigen"" case;  it has some basic cosmetic differences, but the material, the other all design is the same;  you wonder if same plant in China is making different variations of the same thing.  Obviously, in the end, the case one likes (or doesn't like) is going to depend on your individual needs.  I like this case for the following reasons: a.  It's relatively small / thin.  I am guy, I don't carry a purse, I don't utilize some method to carry the phone on the belt;  I just carry it in my pocket and thus I definitely don't / can't have a case that's bulky. b.  It's simple:  if for whatever reason you need to take this off, super easy. c.  It has an open window / face.  I already utilize an ""invisible shield"" on the LCD of the phone and thus don't want those cases with another protective shield. d.  It works:  I don't purposely drop my phone, but it's taken a few spills and I'm sure that this has protected it.  It's a no brainer that whatever case one ends up with, one needs to purchase a case for their iPhone.  All in all a simple but solid and effective product.",Another iPhone Case that works as advertised.,1397779200,4.0,,case depend phone like cosmetic use work belt lame like shield come need product opportunity open china purse brainer can't plant get thing lcd take reason definitely sure wonder protective make solid already simple take different obviously invisible protect that's variation spigen one face whatever check currently relatively utilize material reason go iphone design super want almost thin thus purchase difference bulky spill method end purposely work easy effective basically drop identical case need window i'm pocket end basic individual another carry small guy follow

You can stick it on windshield, or buy a beanie and stick it on there. There's not much to be said about that.  Now on the other hand, the mounting action itself is where this product wins my love and support. There are two options to how you can do it. If your phone has a detachable back, like an Android or Galaxy, you take a very thin metal plate and put it in the back then reattach the back plate. If you have a phone with no back cover or something like an iPhone, then all you have to do is take the little smiley face guy and stick it on the back of your phone.  Either way, there is now a metal plate on your phone, which then sticks to the magnet in the mount like glue! Since its metal, not a magnet, you don't have to worry about messing up credit cards. And if you chose the stick on plate, then the good news is that you don't have to worry about it falling off. They use a quality adhesive. In case you decide to take it off, or trade in your phone, mine came off with a little prying with a butter knife, and some Windex to clean off the residue.  And the magnet is super cool quality too.

I'm not particularly clumsy or worried that I will crack my iphone screen, but I still like to protect the phone for resale purchases and to keep my phone lasting as long as possible.  New technology always intrigues me and I was immensely intrigued to try the glas.t screen protector.  With the combo, I felt the price was perfect for trying - still a little expensive, but not too bad if I didn't like it.  Really, I shouldn't have been worried.  SGP sent the screen protector and case promptly (seriously, I received free first class shipping and I think I received it within a day or two) and I installed it as soon as I received.  The screen protector is easy to isntall and the fit is almost perfect.  My installation left it slighly misaligned, but not enough for me to reinstall. My husband recommended installing in the bathroom using the heat and humidity to eliminate dust specks.  I didn't do that and I did get one small dust speck under the screen protector.  This is my fault and not the fault of SGP.  The speck is on the screen part so when my Iphone is on, I can't really tell it's there.  I really like the screen protector takes nothing away from the original screen - it looks just as sharp and the touchscreen interface loses no performance. The screen protector also came with some bubble home button stickers to protect that as well.  I put the home button sticker on and with my slim armor case - I love that my whole phone is protected.

I used the stock software that came with the GT-1 and had no problem getting the hardware (cable & radio) detected using Windows 7.0 Professional 64-Bit. However, I was not able to get the hardware to detect using Windows 8.1 Professional 64-Bit version. I was also unable to get the software to load AT ALL on Windows 7.0 using XP compatibility mode, so I will assume that this hardware does not work with Windows XP, either. Oddly, the software does mention supporting Windows VISTA. Go figure.  Unlike some reviewers here, I had no problem getting the connector to ""fit"" with the radio. Everything seemed to fit snugly. The USB end of the cable is a tad large though, so I wouldn't plan on plugging any other USB devices right next to it. I'm not quite sure why the USB end of the connector is so large. It seems like a poor design.  Much like it's radios, this Baofeng/Pofung patch cable is rather cheap. It does exactly what it is supposed to do though and for $7 (approx current price) you really don't have much to lose. It isn't something that you will likely use on a regular basis, so wear and tear on the cable should be minimal. Baofeng has always been know for their incredibly cheap two-way radios.

I got this case in December, so less than 1/2 of a year. The charging buttons have fallen off sp now the cradle is useless, the case is so tight I can't get the phone out without breaking it and now the USB port is failing. I contacted customer service earlier as mentioned below when the buttons fell off and never got a response.  So I give up. I have ordered an apple case, hump and all, and have concluded their design is superior. Not only can I access my lightning port, meaning I can sync via iTunes with normal speed, but it's specifically designed to slip on and off.  Sorry Spyder, nice idea in many ways but horrible execution and customer service is non-existent.  This case is even worse than Mophie.  *****  Unfortunately I have to review my review. I purchased the charging cradle too. In late February I put it in to charge and nothing happened so I looked and the small metal conductors on the right side had fallen off.  I'm not hard on my phone. If anything I baby it. So I don't think I was mishandling anything. Anyway I wrote them several days ago to ask what I could do. I would like to exercise my warranty as I didn't do anything particularly abusive. Not one peep back so a big strike for customer service. That's so disappointing. I had to call my city today to find out some local information. The CITY had better customer service. That's so bizarre I should go slap myself. Yet it's true: they didn't know what to do but looked it up and called me back pronto.  When DMV surpasses your customer service that's beyond a warning sign.  As I said earlier the case is so tight that you can barely get the phone out. I stressed the sides to the point where the casing around the sound buttons warped. That's how hard I had to push to try to get it out and I still couldn't.  They have yet to answer. So I guess I'll go with this for awhile then go back to Mophie. I wanted to like this case but these issues just made it very difficult.",This is really nice with one major flaw. Well now two.

The processor isn't super fancy (like the 4GB zenfone 2) but it feels snappy and really we're getting to the point where cellphone processors are all pretty fast,  I mean it has 8 cores). 3 Gigs of memory is quite a bit for a phone right now and seems to be plenty.  It gets regular security and stability updates (still no Marshmallow yet, but should be soon).  The screen is nice and crisp and large if rather dim in sunlight, it's still usable even then.  The ""laser"" is more than a gimmic, I actually have a ""regular 4GB ram"" version of the Zenfone 2, and I compared the cameras holding both at the same time.  In a dim room the regular one will be way out of focus for 1-2 seconds while the Laser focused almost immediately and stayed focused properly.  That said the camera is still noticeably not as good as a Samsung Galaxy S6.  Zenfone 2 Laser is not as crisp, doesn't focus as fast or shoot as fast, and focuses less reliably.  Still the laser is a welcome addition, and for a cheap phone with no Optical Image Stabilization it's really not bad.  Comparing side-by-side with a Galaxy S6 the only obvious disadvantage is the camera,  comparing side by side with a Note 5 the screen isn't so bright and vibrant and it doesn't have the cool stylus.  Still, you're saving probably close to 4-5 hundred bucks, and staying out of the serfdom of AT&T.","GREAT phone for the price.

You get a semi rigid silicone cover that adds  a nice barrier to drops and bumps your phone may have. Along with giving you a solid grip to keep slips to a minimum out of your hands as well. Also this should keep the case on solid ground if you happen to lay it on a slick surface that is not even or your phone could slide off or be knocked off of.  On top of that is a harder TPU style plastic that has 2 nice accent holes in it to show off the design on the silicone breaking up the back of the phone along with the Apple logo hole.

I haven't put it on my phone yet but it looks as though it'll fit nicely. The cut-outs look good and the edges/corners seem well-padded in case of a drop. The thing that kind of bugs me about this case is the overall design.  First, on the back of the case, there are four little plastic (rubber?) screws on each corner with a ""phillips"" head that look as though they can be tightened or loosened with a screwdriver. Not sure what that's all about, but right now they kinda stick out a little bit. I don't really know why they're there. Secondly, the hinge for the kickstand on the inside of the case looks like it might mar or scratch the back of the actual phone when moved. Maybe, maybe not. But, I also bought a wireless charging back for $99 and I certainly wouldn't want any damage to come to it. It's probably a non-issue but I still have a little concern about it.  I'm probably only going to use this case in the event that I'm viewing video for an extended period of time (with the kickstand), which isn't very often.

I admit they are extra clear, until you touch them, and they leave fingerprints all over them. In fact, it is so bad, that I use a pattern lock on my phone, if anyone picked up my phone they could just look at the fingerprint swipes on the screen protector and see my pattern.  I had a Moto X phone, and the screen protector I had a matte like finish instead and didn't leave fingerprints all over the screen. I think I am going to have to find something similar for my Nexus 6 because in any type of sunlight at all, the fingerprints and smudges all over the screen make it really hard to read the screen.

Unfortunately this case has been a nightmare since the day it arrived.  When it arrived the mail packaging seemed fine but when I opened it it had a huge dent in the retail package which actually put a dent in the case by the power button.  To return it was too big of a hassle for what little I paid for it.  I went ahead and tried the case.  It seemed to fit nicely.  I can slide two cards.... wait why is volume notification popping up?  Ok closed it.... I can slide two cards in it tightly but one fits best.... what the heck why is the volume notification back on?  Ugh I can't type because the notification won't go away.  Push my phone harder in the case..... It even fits in my holster for my other case which is nice for work..... wait why the heck is my phone ringing at work?  I have it set to vibrate.  Oh, the volume notification is back on.  Let me turn my ringer off again......  As you can see, this case is so frustrating.  It isn't properly aligned with the buttons and it has nothing to do with the dent in the other side because other reviewers mention it as well.

It usually lasts a whole day no problem. But every once in awhile it gets pretty close to dying before the day is over and I thought why not get an extended battery. Stumbled upon this Laza Zcell extended battery or the Ankler Extended battery and this was slightly cheaper and had better reviews so I went for this one. Glad I did!  Popped it out of the box and straight into my phone, put the back cover it came with on and boom powered up no problem. Let the battery drain throughtout the day and charged it at 13%. Not sure how long it took to charge but I just charged it overnight and when I woke up fully charged. The instructions also say to charge overnight for the best results so I don't think there should be any concern about overcharging it overnight. I woke up and unplugged it at 9AM and by 8PM the battery is at 72%! That's 11 hours! However I used my phone only moderately but still I'm impressed. This was the first charge cycle I have used with the battery and I'm pretty impressed. The instructions the battery came with stated that it takes about 5 charging cycles to get the full capacity for the battery. So I'm expecting it to last even longer!  The battery of course does make the phone bolkier but I actually think holding the phone feels better with the added size. The backing has a gloss type finish and if you get the white backing the finger prints don't stand out that much. As for the weight I haven't noticed that much of a difference. Weighs the same to me.  The only reason I was hesitating to get this extended battery was the very limited case options. This phone is amazing and for the amount I paid for the phone I'm going to protect it with a case. I did find one case called the Hyperion Extended Battery Honeycomb Case. It doesn't provide Otter Box protection but I'm just glad that there's something to cover it until I find something better  First impression I have on this battery is great.

What are the benefits of the Anker mouse? here you go: 1. It's a lot cheaper. M305 is ~$25+. Last I checked. 2. Fancy buttons! The M305 has got none of that. There is even a button that you have to push every time you come back to it to turn it back on, and that saves power. It sleeps automatically, I think, but has to turn back on using the button. Look at the picture-it's the little rectangular one right up the ridge from the click wheel, at the top of the hill. Like I said, saves power. The M305, however, sleeps automatically AND turns back on automatically. When you grab it. 3. The USB thing goes right into the back of it for travel. With the M305, you have to open it up and put the thing inside. It sticks in the back of the mouse pretty tight. 4. Bigger, if you like that. 5. Patronize Anker, for having affordable but top-of-the-line stuff most of the time, and for having invested in a strong customer service department. They were so nice to me with their emails after I wrote my first review, that I had to rewrite it, writing this one. I had to soften the tone from ""this mouse sucks"". I'm not asking for a refund of my mouse, although they offered, offering a free replacement as well; instead I'll keep it around as a back up, I suppose. 6. Since I've only technically seen one mouse, who knows? Maybe it was a dud. Like I mentioned infra, they offered me a free replacement that I turned down. But in all honesty, I think I would rather them retain the benefit of the doubt, because I have no need for two of these mouses.

I was thinking that it would charge my electron hungry devices 8X faster. But then I read a little closer and it says the battery recharges 8X faster. It also states that in the manual that users cannot charge their mobile phones and tablets faster than the standard speed set by the phone manufacturers.  OK, fast recharge times would be nice, so lets take a look at the Ultrapak Tour. The front of the box has a lift up top that displays the battery beneath a plastic shield  very attractive packaging! Under the flap there are some specs  a 15 minute charge of the battery will be able to charge your smartphone for the day. Meaning that it will have just enough electricity to give to your phone one charge. A 30 minute charge will charge your smartphone twice and give you 20% usage for tablets. A 60 minute charge will give you 3.5 charges of your smartphone and 40% usage time for your tablet.  The battery weighs in at 9.3 oz and is charged with its own DC wall adapter. I assume that this is why it can charge faster than using a microUSB adapter as many other batteries use. A single press of the power button will give the % of battery power left in the battery. A double click will turn on the included flashlight  another nice touch. My battery came with 50% charge  after plugging it in, it was fully charged in a little more than an hour. This is much faster than other batteries I have used. I have one battery that took 24 hours to come to a complete charge! There is an orange light that glows when the battery is charging and turns to blue when fully juiced. Another nice feature is that when the battery is charging, the battery will tell you how long until the battery is fully charged. This is an awesome feature!  There are two charging ports on the battery. You can use one or both. One port is a 2.1 A for tablets and one is a 1.0 A for smartphones. The iPhone 6 battery is 1,810 mAh  which means the Ultrapak  could charge your dead iPhone completely 5.5 times in an ideal world. My iPad 3 has an 11,560 mAh battery which means this battery could almost completely charge it. Real world mileage will be a little less than this.  I found that it charged my iPhone 6 from 10% twice and still had over 50% charge left.  It comes with a one year warranty should anything go wrong in the first year. It does come with a higher than average price tag for a battery, but if you need a recharge in a hurry, it will certainly be worth the extra money. The UNU Ultrapak Tour is a winner in my book!

A bit about this speaker:  1)  AWESOME SOUND QUALITY.  It can get loud at full-volume--like louder than any other portable speaker I've ever used (and I'm a techie, so I've had at least a dozen different types, ranging from full-size portable party/karaoke speakers to bluetooth, to this compact type).  The beauty of this speaker is that, even at high volumes, the sound doesn't get distorted or tinny.  When daisy chained with one other speaker, it is loud enough to rival my inset home-theater setup at mid-volume.  2) THE CHARGE LASTS A LONG TIME.  Firstly, love the rechargeable battery.  One huge pet peeve of mine with other portables is that you always need to change out the batteries (usually at the most inconvenient times), and you never know when they'll actually run down so, if you are on the go, you better bring along a pack of extra batteries. PITA.  This thing takes next to no time to charge up via my laptop, and the charge lasts for hours and hours--maybe even days?  Who knows?  I've been playing music nonstop today on two of them daisy-chained together, and they are still working like they are newly charged.  So, at higher volumes, you can count on at least 6-8 hours constant play minimum. I also often forget to turn off my speakers after my music has stopped, but they seem to keep the charge extremely well despite it.  3) FEATURES VOLUME CONTROLS, POWER BUTTON, AND DAISY-CHAIN INPUT JACK.  Love that I can adjust the volume on these things, rather than only have the option to adjust it on the source.  And not only can you daisy-chain as many of these as you want (which I highly recommend--you cannot believe the quality of sound that comes out of these in multiples), but the more units actually enhance the quality of the sound, rather than compete with each other and end up causing distortion.  4)  PERFECTLY PORTABLE.  Closed, this thing is about the size of a biscuit--a smallish one, at that. I have dainty hands, and it fits in my flattened palm with about 1/2"" of skin left over around the perimeter of the unit.  The retractable bass enhancement feature is really easy to use (don't over-twist it--only takes a bit to unlock and relock)and really enhances the sound quality. The input jack is connected to the bottom of the device, but it's got brilliant little built-in grooves to hold it flat and tight against the unit bottom when not in use. It also comes with its own little carrying bag to keep it dust-free and ready to roll. It's SUPER lightweight, and the pinched centers around the base make it easy to hold  and carry (say, in case you want to wake your lazy teenager up when they're sleeping past two on a Saturday afternoon).  5)  EXCELLENT DESIGN.  This speaker was designed to maximize function without skimping on form.  The low-profile of the unit means you don't have to worry about knocking it about--it can easily stay situated, even on slopes--especially since there are tiny rubber nodules at each corner of its bottom to give it extra grab.  It might sound like having it be so tip-proof might not be such a big deal, but when you consider that you have functional power and volume buttons, you want to be able to press down on those without having the unit rock or tip over (on this model, the area that is blue actually presses inward on three sides--one is power, one is +volume, the other is -volume).  6)  GREAT QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE. Compare this unit to similar models and the others just don't cut it.

Tips to avoid problems:  This may sound like plain common sense but a lot of people don't do a practice run first. Place the screen saver with protective film still on over your phone's screen to get an idea of what you're dealing with. When you can picture where it needs to go, you'll have less surprises later (you can't reposition once even part of it is placed on phone).  Something that I learned from window tinting, clean, clean, CLEAN THAT SCREEN! The one thing that will hinder the adhesive from sticking properly is dirt, dust, and oil. It has to be cleaned just before you apply. Not clean, walk away, then come back and apply. It only takes a second for dust in the atmosphere to settle back. Use the wet cleaning cloth that comes with it and wipe from one side to the opposite...not in a circular motion. After it's been cleaned and dried with the little shammie, don't touch the screen with your fingers as you may deposit unseen oils back onto the screen. This is the reason why some people have spots that won't stick.  After reading the other reviews I made sure to line up the side edges with the edges of the screen as perfectly as possible. Since the screen saver doesn't allow any room for error, you really have to be sure both sides are perfectly aligned edge to edge. If you do not do this, you may see an extra line down the side of your screen when you turn on your screen. It really has to be close to exact. If you have a white iPhone, it shouldn't be a problem to line up. But if you have a black one, you may want to turn your screen on to a relatively white webpage so you can get a good contrast on where the edges of your screen are.  Be aware of the type of lighting you are using when working on this! Here is where I goofed... I was working with a lamp that was directed towards my work area from a side angle. It's hard to explain but after aligning the side edges with the screen, I had to align the top (speaker and camera) and bottom (home button). Well the side lighting created the smallest hint of a shadow through the screen saver. The screen saver is so ridiculously clear, that you can easily mistaken the shadow for the edges of the screensaver. I had lined up the protector perfectly, even centering the hole over the camera. When I finished applying, I realized that it was never centered, the circular hole that I lined up with was just the shadow. I ended up covering part of the front camera. Fortunately the top and bottom are much more forgiving than the sides. I just happened to have my phone sideways when I was working on it, therefore I had shadows going through the top and bottom of my protector. Had I been working on my phone in a vertical position I'm sure I would have been thrown off by the shadow enough to run into the same issues as others with the rainbow line. I can easily see why so many people are having problems aligning the side edges perfectly. Fortunately the front camera still works fine and I didn't cover the home button up. But for a perfectionist that was a bit of a bummer.  Pros:  The application tabs make all the difference. Without them I would have struggled to get this centered without getting oil and prints all over it.  Crystal clear. Not a single bubble, no rainbows, etc. I personally don't mind that it's smaller than the face of the phone. It's so clear that it's barely noticeable. And when compared to the alternative, sticky film, it will stay looking this way for much longer. Sticky films tend to get lint stuck to it, edges lift, appear dull, feel funny to the touch, and scratch easily. Not to mention that they never really look as clear as they should be.  Applied easily, didn't have to work it in much or smooth it out. Sort of dropped into place literally once any part of it was lowered to the phone. Watch out for that!  Comes with screen cleaner, shammie, dust removal stickers, stickers to remove old screensaver, and card squeegee (not that you'll need it).  Lays very flat even with the slight goof. No edges are lifting and none are over curved parts of screen.  Significant reduction in fingerprints. There's barely any...no smudges either.  Screen saver feels really smooth to touch. Much Smoother than without it. If you use Swype, you're going to really like this.  Retails for $29.95! I'd say it's a bargain on Amazon.  Cons: I already expected it to be smaller than the actual screen. Could they have made this a 0.5mm wider to make things a bit easier for us? I think so. But then you also increase the chances of the edges lifting. Just food for thought, but if the screen protector were to be wider, you would have even less wiggle room to play with. It would be less forgiving because now you're even closer to the curved edge than before. Still I do wonder if this was deliberate or just an oversight? Other than not having tips for application, I can't say I've found any cons yet. We applied two of these tonight for 2 phones without major issues and didn't use the stickers nor squeegee.

The soft part does try to slip around a little bit but once it is all on, everything is nice and tight. The rubber bumper provides enough soft protection to keep the phone clean of scratches that you sometimes get from the cases that just have a hard shell. It also gives you a little bit more protection from falls. The back of the hardshell has a nice texture that looks good and also keeps the phone in your hand. You don't have to worry about it slipping out of your fingers. It looks good as well and the buttons are easily accessible. I don't think it would help the phone survive a good drop, but maybe. Short fall would be ok.  As other reviews have mentioned, when you pull it out of the package you will have that fresh rubber smell. It dissipates over time. If it bothers you, just sit it outside for a couple of hours or something to air it out. The smell lasted a few hours on mine. It either went away or I got used to it. I'm going with it went away though.  All in all I would recommend this case for someone who wants a better look to their phone, and wants the phone to stay in new condition.",this one isn't too bad.

2476,353651,5,True,"08 21, 2014",A27OMQ5SPBSAHT,B00HFMWZCC,,mnmike,"I would recommend spending the few extra dollars to buy a replacement screen that is already mounted to a new frame.  It makes the installation much easier.  Replacement glass for smart phones seems to be weaker than the original gorilla glass.  Any flaws in installation will give you problems down the road (broken glass).  Buying the screen already attached to the frame avoids these flaws.  Suggestion: buy a screen protector to put on when you install the screen.  No better time and it will help keep the screen looking good.  Also, this is a good time to replace the battery.  The battery doesn't cost much and you won't want to disassemble the phone again just to replace the battery.  Pros:  - simple installation  - looks fine  - works well so far  - the kit included all the tools needed to do the replacement.  Cons:  - colors are a little off as compared to the old screen.

If you're considering the larger phone as a cross between a phone and a tablet, there's a few things to consider.  -- Quick Comparison  6"" Blu Studio (this phone) vs the 7"" BLU Studio Phablet--    -- OS  --  Even though they're from the same company, the 6"" Studio and the 7"" are running different flavors of the operating system. The 6"" version is much more polished. More thought and care went into the design and setup of the phone.    -- Screen --  The screen is much more brilliant and sharp in the 6inch studio. Hands down, you'll enjoy the 6"" Studio's screen.    -- Resolution --  The 6"" Blu Studio makes much better use of the screen space. The Phablet is as big as your face, but the menu options, and radio buttons are tiny. The screen options and buttons feel much more natural on the 6"".   -- Set up --  The 6"" is much easier to setup. The 7"" Phablet asked for email setup, and I thought it was the google account setup, no, it just wanted IMAP setup. This 6"" Studio was much easier to get set up.   -- Size --  The Phablet was just too big for us. We couldn't handle the power. The 6"" is much more manageable.   -- Everything else --  In just about every other aspect (Camera, speakers, responsiveness, etc.) the Blu 6"" is superior in every way.  -- Weird things (Not so good) --  1. The battery is not installed. You have to install the battery. Is that weird, or is that how Android phones now come?  2. The box contents say it includes a screen protector, but it looks like one is already applied. That's nice, but hey, maybe I get a certain joy in installing the screen protector myself. Okay, maybe not, but I noticed two little (very little) air bubbles at the bottom of the screen protector.  Note: The phone comes with a ""screen protector"" sticker applied that shows the phone features. It has a peal away tab. Underneath that, it appears that there is already a screen protector on the glass. Near the front facing the camera, there is a cutout of the protector to not cover the camera. All this is in addition to really thick screen protector that is in a sleeve that you can apply yourself. Weird.  3. When entering your Google Account info. Contacts and Calendar will not automatically sync. You have to go into the settings to get them to sync to your Google Account. This was a real pain to figure out at first.  4. We installed the Google Hangouts Dialer (more on that in a minute) to make calls without a SIM card, and after a few hours, when we clicked on the App (app is still there remember), a notice appeared saying the app wasn't on the phone. Strange, because we had installed and used it just an hour earlier, and the app still showed on the phone. Weird.  5. It would be nice if phone encryption were turned on by default. It's not, and when you turn it on, you can't unlock the phone with a screen swipe. It has to be with a PIN or password. The funny thing is that with the 7"" BLU phablet, you still have the option for face recognition unlock which is way less secure (just hold a picture up, unless you go into the settings and tell it to require a blink).   -- Weird things (but in a good way) --  The phone comes with a silicone case usually, you have to buy a case separately. The case is a great fit. It's a nice addition.  -------------- Ability to make calls with out a SIM card --------------  With the Google Hangouts and Google Hangouts Dialer app, you can make phone calls without a sim card. This can be a handy feature until you get a sim card(s) in the phone. For example, if you're trying to decide between pre-paid sims/cards.  You'll need a free google voice number.  Install the Google Hangouts Dialer  Open the app, then click on settings, and then your google account.  Check the ""Incoming Phone Calls"" text box to receive calls.  You'll also want to check the Ring on Incoming Phone Calls  (You'd think they'd just have all this set to default, but it's not.)  Go back to the settings again, and select ""SMS"" then ""SMS Enabled"" to use your Google email/Hangouts for SMS messages.  When the Google Hangouts Dialer decided to stop working/uninstall itself, we went back to the Google Play store, and had to reinstall it.  We noticed that a Google Hangouts update installed on the phone, and it's possible that the update disabled, but didn't completely uninstall the dialer app, because the Dialer app, and Hangouts now look pretty much the same. Maybe Google is consolidating the apps. Still, that lowered our confidence in the Google Play system (or the phone if it was the phone's fault) because what other apps might stop working and pretend they're not installed anymore?  --------  Some Minor Annoyances --------  One thing that is annoying is that there are plenty of settings that should just be turned on by default, but are not, and it leaves you scratching your head wondering why.  For those wanting to switch from an iPhone. You'll be disappointed that Android hasn't come further along (I'm talking about setup, settings, and ease of use out of the box).  These phones are all basically google phones. They really need a google account to run everything, yet there's so much stuff that needs to be configured independently.  For example, you enter your google account info on the phone, and you expect the contacts to sync with your google contacts. Nope. You have to go into settings and tell the phone explicitly to sync calendar and contacts. Those should be turned on by default or at least asked for when you enter you google info for the first time.  ------ With all that said....  For the price, it's a fantastic phone. If you're okay with some of the set up, and settings quirks, this phone could be a great phone.","Compared to the (less expensive) Blu Studio 7"" Phablet, this 6"" takes the cake",1420848000,4.0,,power maybe consider notice apps consolidate phone say studio's card(s figure encryption resolution turn get enabled thing expect independently different superior stop ability responsiveness polish really picture anymore sms turn tell annoy setup sim funny possible try large imap easy click they'd big hour stuff version separately screen flavor would everything peal recognition email/hangouts info click show dialer text run set two pre-paid mean without system go example tab they're note apply every camera password phone away joy much radio think enjoy default like annoyance could come usually might open sync hold tablet can't unlock button ask sims/cards well size ring enter thick apply minor one make account contact option leave instal company strange appear quirk first vs certain remember phone's time android call buy etc also still voice brilliant phablet bottom install secure case enter need uninstall pretty yet try though run comparison there's incoming noticed protector nice weird blu menu use head natural automatically hour say near need receive think battery least aspect big scratching hand silicone wanted wonder go less box little thing working/uninstall face back free good consider quick use fit talk design come google manageable message blink check content operate fault cutout plenty front select make i'm work along look installed setting say confidence unless care look sleeve want email bubble air explicitly option ease app way speaker feature appear space configure lowered handy completely glass show pin addition great disappointed already hangouts feel real pain calendar handle earlier that's play cross underneath sharp pretend nope face iphone card update price minute number sticker want studio decide switch disable fantastic hey even reinstall else basically require okay cover include make tiny decide store feature swipe

I previously had the One Touch 2, and it was pretty decent, but it didn't work to well with my HTC One M9 because of the power button location, so I decided to get the Touch3 which you can adjust the base on it,  After removing the Touch 2 which I only had on for 1 month, I now have a nice spot and indentation on my dash. (Again I only used it for 1 month). I decided I might as well put the Touch 3 directly on top of where the Touch 2 was so at least I won't have to see the damaged spot.  The first thing I noticed is the new redesign is a blatant ""hey look I'm an iOttie product"". Before it was nice and inconspicuous, now it jumps straight at you. Second, when you flip the arm to the more ""compact mode"" its actually a good 2 inches shorter then before, which now forces you to use it in reverse so get the extra extension.  Lastly this new one didn't even stay mounted. It looks like it uses the same system as the Touch 2. But it didn't even stay mounted overnight. When I got in my car the next morning it had fallen over. I contacted their support and I was told that is not normal after providing proof of purchase they said they were sending me a replacement.

If you read my reviews for the wiring harnesses and install kits, you know you need to research, research, research what you need for YOUR vehicle install.  Reviews are good, but the different automotive forums are the best source of material.  The install was done a month ago and was fairly straight forward for the F250 where the biggest challenge was getting the stereo to fit in the ""1 1/2 din"" slot (took A LOT of filing).  It's in there so tight I sure hope I don't have to ever remove the dash face again...  Not sure it would come off w/out removing the steering wheel now.  For the Expedition, figuring out the wiring harnesses was the biggest challenge.  Install into the dash went well but was painstakingly slow as I wanted everything to fit very well and look good.  The biggest ""ghetto look"" is the Bluetooth (BT) dongle which just kinda hangs out under the stereo mount where I filed a hole to run it through...  (My wife didn't want me cutting holes in her dash or center console.)  The stereos have been absolutely fantastic.  They look good, sound good, and work very well.  My biggest complaint about the stereos themselves is that the menu functions are a bit tedious to go through, but definitely NOT a deal breaker or worth a ""star deduction"".  My wife's first comment after ""Pretty!"" was ""wow, I didn't know my speakers sounded so good!""  In both the truck and Expy, the quality of sound improvement was VERY noticeable, and the color options for the lighting make it very easy to match the truck's OEM lighting (if you so desire).  In the end, I do not think anyone but a true audiophile would be displeased with these head units!  You can't go wrong for the price.  There was one troublesome issue that I JUST figured out today (9/27).  I could NOT get the stereo BT to pair w/ either mine or my wife's previous Smartphone.  I kept getting an error message about the passkey being incorrect, even though I METICULOUSLY ensured the randomly generated passkey on the phone matched the head unit.  I finally decided it must be the older phones so I waited until we got new phones this week.  Wouldn't you know, pairing FAILED.  Again.  Same passkeys not matching error message, even though they matched...  Back to the internet...  Finally read on a forum where someone used the volume button on the head unit (as per the verbatim JVC instructions) to start the pairing instead of their phone's interface.  AH HAH!!  But...  Failed.  Again...  I restarted the phone, turned off / on the stereo, but to no avail.  I was about to do a factory reset on the stereo when I tried one last time using the JVC volume button.  While it was ""pairing"", I decided on a whim to also hit the Smartphone display to initiate pairing.  IT WORKED!!!  PAIRED IMMEDIATELY!!  FINALLY!!!  So, word to all future users, when you go to pair your phone, use both the head unit volume button and the Smartphone user interface pairing function.  First thing I did was call my wife using the BT function and it worked beautifully.  The truck was not running so there was no diesel engine noise, but she said it was crystal clear on her end.  I'll try again later with the engine running.  (Side note, I put the BT mic up at the top of the A-pillar.)  In conclusion, my wife and I really like the stereos.

The case didn't even break; it just has a gouge mark on the corner that took the brunt of the fall, and all four corners are scratched up by the concrete.  I'm going to treat this like a bicycle helmet - if you crash, get a new one.  Fortunately, this case also is reasonably priced!!  Just a note on the color.  This is a HOT PINK case.  It looks more magenta in the photo to me than in real life.  My daughter tells me it is her absolute favorite shade of hot pink.

(Oct 08, 2013)  In my previous review I had mentioned that i would update on how the case was holding up. It has been almost two months now since I have given my sister the case and she has had it on her Galaxy S4 the entire time. She doesn't really go out much other than your occasional errands and to and from work. She usually carries it in hand with her wallet, or in her sweat shirt pocket. There has been some smudging on the outer pink cover from being in her pockets or rubbing on other materials. A friend of mine also has the same case and she is a bit more rough with her case and it's constantly being tossed around in her bag/purse. The pink has faded tremendously and she said she has tried everything to restore it like new. I heard a few methods of cleaning and restoring the cover:  1. Alcohol swabs 2. Baby wipes (which my sister has tried and does not work.) 3. Warm, soapy water with a rag or cloth.  So in a nutshell...if you are a busy woman and are constantly having it in your purse when it gets banged around or constantly in your pockets, you might not want to get such a light color like this highlighter pink. :) Maybe an Admiral Blue! Like myself...My job is very demanding so I always have my phone in my back pocket of my jeans. So I ordered an Otterbox Commuter Series in the ""Marine"" color combo. :D  ORIGINAL REVIEW (Aug 21, 2013)  I recently ordered the Wild Orchid Otterbox Defender and i absolutely love it!  First...the pink is more of a highlighter pink. Very vibrant, and the gray is a bit darker than in the picture...but not by much. I originally bought this case for my sister for her birthday and I'm seriously considering on buying one for myself. The one thing that i worry about this case is that when put into a pocket for a long period of time, the dye of the jeans might bleed onto the case at some point and leave marks...but this is just a theory. It happened once before when i had an Otterbox for my old iPhone 4, but maybe that won't happen this time.  Second...the 2-3 layers protect the phone all around! The volume and Lock Rockers are easy to press, you don't have to put force when pressing the buttons. I read in one review that someone had an issue with the case not properly locking into the holster, causing their phone to slide or fall out because of it. I don't see that ever happening with this at all...it locks in firmly, even when you wiggle the case while in the holster. I think that person might not have ""clicked"" into place. And of course, the holster/stand works as it should. The clip rotates all around and is easy to clip onto your jeans/belts.  But all in all...the case has owned up to its reputation and is protecting her phone! i will be ordering my own very soon!  i will update this review if anythings changed.",You can never go wrong with an Otterbox Defender!,1377043200,3.0,,fall phone first...the sweat cause protect baby protect much bang person hand maybe onto work theory consider demand myself...my even like ever anythings say woman order dye cloth second...the holster reputation hear someone properly usually might bleed think order rotates all...it job wipe purse press clip get tremendously thing pink happen press button orchid rocker buy fade force wiggle color holster/stand mine sister errands long read firmly happen put really lock warm course one love entire otterbox new series issue back change original place rough picture...but layer point mention hold method soon seriously own jean oct lock iphone clicked outer birthday jeans/belts smudge update bit lock want light almost month highlighter time rub swab would all...the tossed friend blue commuter everything admiral also material carry work vibrant see water period restore clean nutshell...if darker leave marks...but easy restore recently marine pocket occasional buy volume gray case wallet constantly rag i'm bag/purse galaxy around since pocket two worry defender soapy old combo previous cover try alcohol slide originally happen go always aug busy get give shirt wild absolutely review

Of all the phone chargers I had the opportunity to review this one has the most innovative design. And it's pretty too (see pic). The designers's goal was to come up with something that's as self-contained as possible without sacrificing a lot when it comes to ease of use and, in my view, they did a pretty good job at it.  And here are the innovations that may not be so obvious just by looking at the picture.  The 'blue' side is in fact a full, some 12"" long USB (Type A, Micro B) cable that fully wraps around the charger's body and can be completely detached. This should allow you to use a 'Mini' cable if your phone doesn't have a Micro USB slot. And, if your phone is an iPhone, there's also a little Apple adapter tucked inside the charger's body. You can easily pull it out and plug it into the USB's Micro end and you have an Apple charging cable. On the 'pretty' side, I liked the small blue status lights - it's fully charged when all 4 lights turn on after you push the button. I also appreciate the included carrying bag.  As for capacity, 5000mAh is not too bad, for something this light and small. The 1A/0.5A output at 5V makes it a good phone charger but probably not recommended for any of the larger tablets.  You charge the charger itself through any standard AC adapter with a USB interface or from your laptop/PC if your don't mind for it taking a little longer.  Overall, it's 5 stars for the good looks, nice and self-contained design and the good capacity vs. weight/size ratio.",Self-contained and pretty too,1380844800,,,adapter look interface nice phone apple designers's capacity view ease use sacrifice longer small button charger charger come tucked take self-contained opportunity completely job pic unit charger's allow slot recommend something cable tablet output long star little micro charge that's picture obvious bag one fact include push like lot turn usb ratio possible weight/size pull large good innovation type iphone innovative probably charge design come light light full fully mind carry blue standard bad also promise see mini receive inside easily laptop/pc detach side exchange plug appreciate wrap usb's status around overall without end body make there's goal charging may look ac pretty review

The two separates, so if you have trouble putting the case on all at the same time, you might just want to put the lining on first, and then snap on the hardcase over that. I did it this way, and I had no hassle at all. The hardcase opens at the back, and you can slide in two cards snugly (you might be able to force in three, I haven't tried. There are two protruding pieces of plastic on each side of the inner compartment, under which you can slide the cards in so they stay securely fastened down. The door for this card compartment snaps shut with two little plastic tabs on each side. If these tabs break, the door will not stay closed - hopefully they won't break off any time in the near future. (If they do, I will post an update) The door is held by two tiny metal rods at each side. As someone else pointed out, it is true that these rods may slide out with use and get lost. But at this time they seem pretty well pushed in, and don't budge even when I try to push them in deeper, so I think there isn't much of a danger of them becoming loose and coming out. The only thing I'd recommend doing before you use the case is to cut out the useless silicone flaps over the earphone jack and the micro-USB charging port. I suppose they are there to prevent dust from going in, but they really are pretty useless -- and not only that, if you don't cut them off, they may cause the silicone case to rip if you keep lifting and pushing them out of the way to charge or to plug earphones. They cut very easily with scissors.

Ive had this phone now for almost a month and cant think of any thing that I am critical of.  Impressive device.  ORIGINAL REVIEW (May 30, 2015) from another listing:  I had Windows phones in the past and this Lumia 640 XL is replacing my Lumia 925. The 925 is a great phone. However, I wanted a phablet. so I could see the larger screen without constantly putting on my glasses.  The first thing that caught my eye was the sunlight readability of the 640 XL. Absolutely stunning. I put the screen up with the full sun coming over my shoulder and had a super clear, easily readable screen. I was shocked.  I was concerned that the 640 XL image (259 ppi) was not as sharp as my old 925 (332 ppi). It isn't, but not by much. Only a discriminating eye would notice.  The 640 XL lacks Optical Video Stabilization, but for a mid grade phone, what do you want? Pan slowly and smoothly. The 13 MP camera with a Carl Zeiss lens does appear sharper than my Lumia 925 with its 8 MP optics. No, the 640 XL does not have Pure View, but so far, I didn't notice any great difference with my 925 that has Pure View. Granted, I'm no Ansell Adams but to me, overall it seems better than the 925.  The phone is easy to hold with its somewhat squared edges. I thought it would be slippery as my 925 is. It isn't. And, it is lighter than I thought it would be. Seems to be a tad heavier than my 925.  I gave it 5 stars because so far, the Lumia 640 XL is much better than expected for an under $300 smooth operating Windows Phablet.  The only negative observation at the moment is that the glance screen does not support everything that was on my Lumia 925. No rotating photos, no weather, no current date. The only thing it shows is the time. This is a disappointment as the full glance screen is very handy. I checked and checked, but can not find a solution. Perhaps there is none.

I recently evaluated the OXA Juice Box S2 10000mAh Safe External Battery, and loved it with some small issues. The one thing I really liked is that it has a digital readout as to how much juice was left etc., but the more I used it, the less I was interested in the readout: I just looked to see when the device(s) were charged.  The S1 has the same quality batteries and though it is 7800mAh rather than 10000mAh, after charging and powering everything from an MP3 player to a bluetooth speaker and Kindle Fire, I must say that I prefer the size of the S1. It is smaller, has rounded edges, and easily fits into a pocket. (It is difficult to explain, but on top of other pluses, it is just more comfortable.) The 4 LEDs on the top readily tells how much power is left in the charger, and it's blinking tells you that it is charging the other unit. Further, unlike the S2 which has the outputs are stamped in black on black, the S1 makes it easy to see which is A1 and which is A2.  Remarkably, I used this on a Bluetooth speaker. It powered the speaker for more than 12 hours AND kept the speaker fully charge when I finally gave up my ""evaluation."" I also charged a Kindle Fire - which I use constantly - in less time than the AC adapter that came with the KF does, and had an MP3 player fully charged from 0 to full charge in less than 90 minutes.

Full disclaimer: My phone, a Galaxy Note 5 was not listed as a supported model. The 3-star review is what I feel about the product overall, and as such, if I had a more-compatible phone.  Size (Only an issue with larger, non-iPhone handsets): For starters, while the unit does stretch out quite far, and can successfully hold a ""phablet"", without having the holster upside down, it is impossible to have both the charger and headphone jack plugged in. This is clearly designed for an iPhone, not an Android. Also, as such, the headphone cable has to be turned at an angle that I feel is dangerous for both the jack on the phone and the cable itself.  Build Quality: I was impressed overall with the build quality at first. The unit has a good amount of flexibility in the goose-neck, as it should, and everything else appeared to be quite sturdy. After about 1 week and a half of using it, I did notice it was starting to slide out of my lighter port. After less than a month, pretty much every time I go over a decent bump, I have to adjust it, which is quite inconvenient and also causing the FM transmitter to lose power. This has not been an issue with other mounts that have used this method in my vehicle.  FM Transmitter and Quick Charging: No complaints on charging. My Note 5 charges quite fast and consistently. The FM Transmitter is hit or miss, as are most. If you find a completely blank frequency, it will work just fine, however, if you live an an area where that is hard to come by, as I do, expect a ton of static.  Overall, for the price, I would recommend this unit only to people who have smaller, lighter, proven-compatible phones; and only if you're like me and hate having a charger, FM transmitter, and mount, all in separate pieces.

Let me say up front that there is a trade-off, but one I am glad to make: this takes the sleek 5S and adds a little extra size to it. Width wise the increase is nominal as is the weight. It does make it about a half inch taller, so if you love the phone's original size this will detract slightly from the aesthetics.  Looks aren't everything, though, because use time is more important to me and I am not always around a charger. The 2300mAh capacity of the integrated battery is almost 1.5 times that of the 5S' internal 1560mAh battery. Even accounting for loss from charging that is still twice the use time of a 5S without this case, which is why I love it.  Another feature I love is the way the case protects the phone. While Apple builds their phones to withstand a lot of abuse, this case adds another layer of protection. It is shock resistant, and the way the outer lip is slightly raised gives the screen more protection if you drop the phone in a carpeted office.  Others have described how this case works and fit and form, so I am not going to repeat that information. I will say that the final selling point for me is this case earned Apple's MFi (Made for iPhone) certification, which gives me peace of mind. There are too many products on the market that are of shoddy quality or from fly-by-night outfits, so the certification is not only meaningful, but worth a premium price to me. Considering that this case is competitively priced is yet another value point and one of the reasons why I awarded it five stars.",A solution for iPhone 5 and 5S battery issues,1393372800,,,look product apple phone price capacity build sample use performance premium consider way feature sell protection phone peace charger value extra glad lip abuse market interest half others time battery shoddy important office many inch raise reason slightly account sleek trade-off size less detract aesthetic star little loss one love lot quality original increase make point let go shock give twice carpet iphone worth outer fit price weight almost meaningful phone's add time screen mind fly-by-night outfit information describe award wise everything test still casual work earn even form five front drop taller make case mfi width around competitively yet layer integrate spectacular without though take resistant certification repeat nominal always say charge another internal final apple's withstand protect review

It is troublesome to install, but not impossible.  Might be easier to instal if you directly tape one edge in place like a clam shell before appling and squeegeeing out the application solution: as the protector floats and slides around while it is still wet until the application solution dries away.  This is very troublesome because every time you touch it with the squeegee or bump it it moves about: so it takes lots of effort and may tries before you get it tot point; where the water based solution and all bubbles are removed and the protector ends up in the perfect position on your last touch so it can finish the very long ""overnight"" drying process.  After the protector no longer slides about you are suppose to hold the edges down with the heel of your hand until they mold and stick to the curved edges.  I instead flipped my phone face down and place it inside a molded jacketed phone case so that the edges were held in place overnight so I did not have to worry about the the protector moving or coming loose untill it was fully dried.  I then carefully pried the case away from the phone by inserting a paper clips on each side of the power button which allowed me to carefully remove the phone without pulling loose the edge(s) of the screen protector during the removal process.  I then replaced the phone face up back in to my molded protection case just as carefully to keep the wrap around case from dislodging the edges of the newly applied screen  protector.  I highly recommend buying a wallet case then tear out the cheap glued in inner phone holder and replace by glueing in one of the top rated 6.6 ft drop tested cases.

When it comes to charging my Cell Phone and E-Cigg Battery, this 5 1/2"" x 2 1/4"" Charger with it's 4"" x 2 1/4"" Solar Panel is Super Powerful and gets the job done in no time flat. Included with the 5000 MAH Solar Charger is a Very Easy To Understand Instruction Manual. a 12"" Micro USB-USB Charging Cable, and a Separate iPhone 5 & 6 Connector which attaches to the Micro USB on the cord. Creative Edge Products, LLC even throws in a 2 1/4"" Carabiner that can be attached to the Charger Handle and used for hands free carry by hooking it onto my belt loop, purse, fanny pack or back pack! The Well Made Charger offers 4 LED Indicator Lights, (1 Green - 3 Blue) which advise me of the amount of charge the unit has left by how many lights are lit from all 4 for 100% power to 3 for 75%, 2 for 50% and 1 for 25%. I appreciate that I can charge both my phone and E-Cigg at the same time when the charger is at full power utilizing both Left and Right USB Ports. When used alone, the Right Port can reach 2.1 amps and the Left Port is 1 amp, but if used together they are both 1 amp ports.

All I have to do to activate the light is hit the Easy To Access Power Button twice and I have a Very Powerful Light Source at my fingertips! It took about 6 Hours in Full Sunlight to charge the Unit from 25% power to 100% and although I haven't measured how long it took to charge my phone and E-Cigg, I can say that it's actually less time than if I use the wall outlet or my laptop.

I am very, very glad that I ordered it, partly because its snugness fits the slim phone perfectly and gives it a rich, substantial feel.  The pale gold rubber of the perimeters grips my hand in a cool, comforting way that assures me that it is not going to be dropped or slip out of my grasp.  The gold fabric on the back is very pretty, and the unobtrusive slot for a credit card or ID is nice for convenience but doesn't add bulk or ugliness to the case.  The cushion of this rubber inside this case is very good, and it is dense enough that when you pick up the phone, it has an expensive, weighty feel.  Normally, an iphone is very light and streamlined (and slippery!), but this case transforms that fragility into a solid, smooth gold leather impression that is costly and elegant in appearance.  All of the apertures and button covers on this case work like a dream; you can charge your phone easily with the case on, even though the opening for the charging port doesn't span very far.  So, you feel like your phone is really well protected, but still extremely convenient and perfectly functional.  The camera is fully visible, and again, I just can't get over how well every detail fits precisely and yet is so beautiful and timeless in fashion and elegance.  A thousand thank-yous are due to the designers and creators of this gorgeous and well made case that transforms my iphone into a whole new dimension of sheer elegance and function.

Heath,"While I have used a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years for hands free calling, I am just now getting into the world of stereo Bluetooth thanks to my Droid X.  After having seen the Jabra Clipper on Verizon's site, I decided to give it a shot.  I will focus on the music experience since that is my purpose in getting this unit.  I still prefer the speakerphone option for calls.  I will use the following criteria for my evaluation:  pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.  Pairing:  This keeps getting easier with each device that I try.  After charging the Clipper, I turned it on and it went immediately into pairing mode.  I was able to pair it with my Droid X simply by scanning for Bluetooth devices and selecting the Clipper - no code required.  I never understood the point of entering the generic 0000 code since it was the same for every device, but that is no longer an issue - at least with the Droid X.  Sound Quality:  The earbuds that come with the Clipper are in a word dreadful.  I switched to the medium sized set of buds in order to get a good seal, but the sound quality of the music was just awful.  It was thin, muddy, and sounded cheap.  Thankfully you can unplug these duds from the Bluetooth receiver and replace them with any 3.5 mm headphones/earbuds of your liking.  The downside is that you will have to spring for these on top of the Clipper if you don't already have a pair available.  For testing purposes I switched to my Creative EP-830 earbuds that came with my Creative Zen X-Fi.  The change in sound quality is night and day different.  If you don't already have an alternative just know that you are going to have to make an additional purchase for the Clipper to be usable.  I am no audiophile, but even my untrained ears found the included earbuds beyond unacceptable.  Ease of Use:  Usability has long been an issue with Bluetooth devices due to the dreaded multi-function button.  The Clipper only has three total buttons when the + and - are added in.  These three buttons control powering on and off, volume, play/pause, navigating songs, and call management.  Each button does at least two things depending on context or length/type of press.  I found this to be manageable but annoying.  Others may find this frustrating.  If you've had bad experience with multifunction buttons on other Bluetooth devices, you can expect more of the same.  One other are of note on ease of use is the ""clip"" itself.  It will work really well on belts and belt loops as well as on shirts with buttons or your jacket.  However the Clipper is very stiff, and I found it impossible to get it on my t-shirt sleeve using one hand.  Yet if you get it secured, it should be very good for active use since it passes military standards for rain and shock resistance.  While it doesn't free you from wires, it will keep you from pulling your high dollar phone or music player off of the treadmill.  Comfort:  This is somewhat of a non-issue based on the poor sound quality, but the included earbuds are also not comfortable.  This is just another reason to replace them.  Overall:  The Jabra Clipper is an intriguing if imperfect Bluetooth stereo device.  You can replace the included earbuds and still come at a decent price.  It is promising for active use, but suffers from the same usability issues that are common among Bluetooth devices.  I think it depends on what you are looking for.  A couple of alternatives to consider are the Lg HBS-700 and Motorola S10-HD.  Each of these has a different form factor and target different user types.

I have an older Logitec Mobile Freedom which was fairly inexpensive yet works great.  I also have a Plantronics Voyager Pro.  My requirements are the basics: good sound quality, simple use, comfort, and cutting down wind/background noise.  At a little over $50, the Jabra Extreme falls right in between the aforementioned Logitec and Plantronics products (about $30 and $75, respectively).  While I really like both of the other products, the Jabra would be my preference.  It cancels background noise out somewhat better than the Logitec and at least as well as the more expensive Plantronics Voyager Pro. I found it had great sound quality on both ends, and there was no background noise at all.  I tested this in my car with the window down at highway speeds, at a soccer game, and in a crowded pub.  Now, please keep in mind, YOU will still hear all that noise as you are there in person, but the person on the other end of your call will have a very easy time hearing you.  And you can hear them fine in noisy situation.  What's in the box?  Quite a bit actually!  Usually, with this type of product you get the headset, a charger and maybe a spare earpeice cover.  Jabra gives you:  * The Jabra Extreme headset * One spare ear rest * Two spare earpiece covers * * AC Charger * Car charger adapter * USB to min-USB connector * User Guide  Setup of the Jabra is what you'd expect.  It charges quickly, usable within a half hour or so and fully charged in about 2 hours.  Displays are simple.  Green is fully charged, yellow 70% or more, and red less than 70% charged.  The charge holds nicely.  I used about 4 hours of talk time in a 12 hour period and still left the device on all night and it was fine the next morning, and I used it for another hour the next day.  The unit is small, smaller than many others, which is nice.  I love my Plantronics but its a pretty big product.  The Extreme is very comfortable and lightweight.  Controls are simple to use.  Slide the on/off button to 'on'.  Green light means it is on, and it will flash blue when connected.  Again, very simple and somewhat typical of a headset.  To answer a call, press the Answer/End button.  Simple.  I paired this device with my Motorola Razr V3, also a Razr V3xx, as well as a Blackberry Bold 9000 and a Pantech Matrix C740 too.  No issues pairing and functioning.  Now, lots of headsets have similar features.  Here are the three things I love about the Extreme.  One, it's very convenient, since it is extremely lightweight, small, and comfortable.  The other is the inclusion of the car charger in the box. With some headsets you get just an AC charger.  The Extreme includes both.  So, in your car, plug in the charger, plug the USB connector into that, and the headset sits right on it, very neat and simple.  If you go to the Jabra website you will see what I'm talking about as far as its car connection.  No long cords, just a small adapter and connector.  Last, but not least, the noise cancellation on this headset is awesome!

According to the insert included in the package, this Mighty Shell + Faceplate case is supposed to protect your phone from scratches and finger prints, impact from dropping the phone, absorbs shock when the case hits the ground, and an adhesive layer is supposed to bond the screen with the faceplate using TrueTap technology.  All in all, the company claims that this case has 2X shatter protection and 2x military grade protection.  I assume military protection is a bit tougher than normal?  How did I go about testing this product? Well, since I'm a scaredy cat and didn't want to take any chances with my actual phone, I found an old phone case that actually fit inside this SPECK phone case.  Was it tight like having a phone in it? Not really but the results were quite eye opening.  First of all, I tested dropping the case.  I am 5'4 and I dropped the case onto my kitchen floor from my waist. The case landed on its corner and low and behold, the test case inside did not pop out.  I tried it again just to be sure.  I then took it to my driveway.  From waist height I again dropped the phone and the case again landed corner first but the pretend phone did not pop out.  I finally put my phone in the case which was a snap.  The faceplate I continue to be reluctant to use because I like to change cases pretty often so I'm not sure I want the faceplate adhering to my phone when I plan to remove the case so much.  I am leaning towards using it just because I have dropped my phone a good bit and while I have a screen protector on my phone, I don't have a faceplate that has five layers of protection that is supposed to adhere to my phone so that there is no trouble typing.  This case lists for $51.00 and some change on Amazon and to me that is expensive so that is a negative for this case -- but, it comes in many colors which is a positive.  I guess if you look at it between spending 51 dollars on a case versus 700 dollars for a new phone the case would win anytime.  Despite the seemingly high price, I still think this case is a good investment towards protecting an iPhone5/5S, 6, and 6+ as well as the new Galaxy S6.  It also comes with a lifetime warranty.

Overall it offers minimal protection and gives me a slightly more ""good"" feeling about it's survivability when it comes to my children.  That being said, the case has a few pros and cons.  The cons being more nitpicking on my part and don't really amount to more than one star dropped from the rating, if that.  Pros: - Kickstand (see cons). - Nearly perfectly cut for the ORIGINAL Galaxy Note 10.1. - Prevents scratches on the rear of the device and has a slight lip over the top that will keep the screen from contacting the ground should you drop it. - Does not interfere with daily use of the tablet in any way. - Surprisingly tough material.  Cons: - Kickstand: It feels a little flimsy but has held up well to a lot of abuse. It is only really appropriate for tabletop use and unfortunately slides quite easily across a table when using the tablet in a propped up position.  Not good for use in bed or on your lap in a chair. - The charging port hole is NOT precisely cut for the stock charger.  It doesn't appear to interfere with the charging at all but it prevents it from seating completely in the port.  This may be just mine, but I'd suspect all are like this. - It's not all around protection.  I have no doubt that if I dropped my tablet in this from any normal height, the consequences would be catastrophic, but perhaps not. - It's form fitting, so much so that I'm afraid to take it off.  There's little give in it, and to take it off requires more force than I'm comfortable using on what amounts to a very expensive and thin layer of glass over a very expensive and thin layer of electronics. - I really have no idea what the 3 layers of protection refers to but to me it would appear that the 3 layers is simply 2 different materials that I can see that make up it's construction.",Minimal protection but makes the tablet feel more safe.,1396828800,,,feel give slight hold much chair amount use quite star way afraid refers like protection seating say charger offer precisely lip tabletop require rear abuse simply prevents survivability completely expensive glass normal tablet child pros i'd con take nitpick slightly feels force different mine daily purchase unfortunately contact surprisingly nearly little electronics really position one drop appropriate part lot prop table original layer cut primary reason material slide good give hole perfectly comfortable come suspect thin across screen catastrophic perhaps would flimsy top bed material see port ground form easily drop idea make rating case height construction appear stock i'm galaxy around overall scratch doubt layer interfere device consequence there's tough fitting well use charge note minimal kickstand undoubtedly lap may keep amount
