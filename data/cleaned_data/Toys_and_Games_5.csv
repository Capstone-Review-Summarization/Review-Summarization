As for the review of the actual sticks themselves, they look flimsy but have held up to some pretty big abuse this week from a 10 and 7 year old. The ball is very squeezable (at first look, I thought it was a dog ball, but without the squeaker) but with the combination design of superman and batman, my son's think it's pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend leaving this set outdoors. The outer plastic wrap (superman/ batman graphics) won't stay on very long in weather. The ball could easily be prone to dry-rot and mold. The sticks are plastic on plastic, if you want to bend the stick in half it would be easy to do.

I've had a chance to check this out and there are certainly some pro's and con's to this.  Pro's: - Releasing the claw feels so awesome. - Sweet sounds (a total of 4) - Little known fact, if you press the button twice quickly and then a third time holding it, it makes one old school doctor sound. If you press the button three times quickly and then a fourth time holding it- it sounds like its broken or malfunctioning. - Lights up, extends and retracts very well in times of emergency. - One button! Compare to the 11th Doctor Sonic, when it is extended you would need to reach for a button on the bottom making it awkward to hold and point. This model works with a single button in the middle extended or retracting making it much easier to fight Dalek's.  Cons: - Gallifreyan technology is very sought after. Protecting it can prove to be quite difficult. - Setting 15B seems to not be working. - I have not been able to repair medical wounds...yet - Does not have a Tardis Docking Station  Update: 8/12/2014 After much trial and error, I still can't open locked wooden doors.

Firstly Ash's feet are too small, they are not proportional to the rest of his body. Because of this it's very trick to get him to stand on his own. His pants also really hinder him from moving his ankles foreword which add to this problem.  You have to really play with the figure and have him lean slightly forward, so no dramatic poses. Secondly he's all around tiny compared to other Neca human figures. I compared his size to the ultimate Ash from Evil Dead 2 figure and he's not in scale to Ultimate Ash at all.

Within ten minutes, one of our group said, ""That was my 'Ah-ha!' moment. I get it now. I see how this is fun."" And from there, we had a great time, playing through a number of rounds before we had a winner.  The concept is pretty simple, with each player taking turns and trying to outsmart his competitors in hopes of being the one to win the princess's affection. There's a lot of luck involved, but also enough imagination, good artwork, and a little bit of strategy to make it fun for everyone. It doesn't require a ton of thinking, it leads to some laughs and frustration while trying to win over the princess, and it's a good time for everyone.

166,463449,4,45.0,True,"05 17, 2013",A3BPA8OCXCEW2I,B004GTMOIW,,Alfred D.,"This expansion seems goofy, but it adds quite a bit of depth overall to the game. This isn't always a plus, however. This review is from playing it on the US version of the game.  Alvin and Dexter are basically a T-Rex and UFO that, while on the map, prevents any player from building a path through the city they occupy. Also, wherever they are at the end of the game, players who have a path to those cities suffer a point penalty...it isn't much usually but it can be enough to turn a win into a loss.  Every time you use Alvin or Dexter, you get a card to signify it. The player who used Alvin the most and Dexter the most by the end of the game gets bonus points, similar to how the longest path gets bonus points. You use them by discarding a locomotive (rainbow) card during your turn as a bonus action....the more locomotives you discard to this the further away you can move them. They then can't be moved for an entire round, meaning players can't just get rid of them on their turn if you just moved them.  The obvious strategy is to keep Alvin and Dexter away from you and in the way of your opponents, forcing them to either build all the way around them or drop locomotives in order to move them. The way it's designed is nice, since your opponents can't negate their effectiveness by simply moving them away right after you move them...they must suffer the consequences of it for a turn at least. This can cause people to pre-emptively move them just so others can't move them on their turn, which adds some mind-games to the mix.  But for us, the best part of what they did was they added a lot of value to the locomotive cards themselves. Usually when locomotive cards flip up, no one draws them, instead opting to get 2 cards instead of the 1 locomotive unless they were just 1 away from finishing a path. Alvin and Dexter changed this dramatically, as it forced people to draw them up to move them, and actually gave them incentive to move them with the bonus points as well. Suddenly people started hoarding them up a bit, as either insurance or to move them on purpose.  The negative is it adds quite a bit more things to keep track of. The game can already get hectic and hard to keep track of without these monsters running the field, and with them you're simply adding more to your plate. They alter strategies and affect the game, but if you want a simpler gaming experience, it's maybe best to keep them off the board, especially if you have beginners at the table.  Overall, for the price cost and the added depth to the game, this is hard to beat. Plus, it's wacky and yet in a way, does make sense as well. For better or worse it will affect the way you play the game, which is all you can hope for from an expansion.",Adds quite a bit to TTR,1368748800,,player track force away nice alvin hard move rainbow incentive card negative much maybe use negate quite pre-emptively goofy rid way move order value however player round start simply prevents usually actually penalty...it others cost mean can't least get opponent affect point bad suddenly enough expansion building seem already beginner locomotive opt monster must path strategy wherever alter well draws strategy hope loss thing action....the draw ufo effectiveness dexter obvious one play depth part beat entire lot them...they change turn city signify t-rex table right add finishing point bonus sense similar occupy dramatically hoard city win use add card bit price want long version add time game especially discard insurance locomotive game also simpler flip basically mix drop hectic purpose make experience discarding plus either design build field play run around since overall move best map yet instead without mind-games board end consequence force people cause suffer well always plate get every wacky keep unless review give

It has 2 different settings for noises (both extremely annoying and loud) and an on/off switch for the cab lights. The firetruck doubles as a coin bank, with a slot on the roof of the truck under the ladder, and a back door to remove the coins. The ladder extends in 3 long segments, and there are stabilizer feet at the back of the truck that can be pulled out and down. It was for my son's 4th birthday, and he loves the moving parts (ladder, stabilizer feet, back door), and since he doesn't care what year or color it is, we're keeping it. I did have to remove the batteries, though, as the noise was just too intrusive. By the way, the only switches are on the bottom of the truck - no buttons on the truck body itself to initiate the lights/noises.

Pros:  NO ACTIONS!  In my opinion, the best action figures are (ironically) the ones with no action.  No buttons, no springs, no joints at odd locations that only bend in one direction.  Just a plain old figure like this one.  Almost all of the other Superman Returns Superman figures have some kind of action.  Personally, this is the only pro I need to convince me.  Cons:  While the head sculpt is decent, it looks only 50-60% like Brandon Routh.  Also the cape is a big issue.  It's non-removable, so when you put on his Clark Kent disguise, the cape must be stuffed into his shirt which makes him look like a hunchback at comic-con dressed up as Clark Kent.  Furthermore, in my opinion, the clothes are too bulky to bother with anyway.  The only piece that looks decent is the hair and glasses.  However, since I only use him for display (as Superman, of course), the Clark clothes don't bother me that much.  Lastly, (and I know some people are going to freak out over this, but it's just an opinion) I prefer vinyl or plastic capes.  It just looks better.  As any tailor will tell you, it's impossible to get a piece of cloth this size to fall like a life-size cape would.  As such, it sticks out rigidly and looks downright tacky to me.  However, that's a collector's opinion.  I will say that for actual play, (which is what these toys were designed for, I suppose) I would prefer a cloth cape.  All of these drawbacks aside, if you're looking to buy a Superman Returns Superman, this is the one.  Oh, and some people have complained about the price.  I managed to snag mine at $19.99 with free shipping to boot!

217,1167054,3,,True,"06 7, 2015",A7Y0MEKYZS3X6,B00NYSSELW,,DroutKaiser,"Combiner Wars Optimus Prime is part of the first wave  of  Hasbro's Combiner Wars line that included the Aerialbots minus 1 member(Airraide comes in wave 2) this been replace with Dragstrip the stunticon team from wave 2.  His a voyager size figure and his very bulky ad taller in comparison to my voyager TPBH Optimus Prime which makes him look small and skinny even though his pretty tall as a voyager and beefy. The vehicle mode is very nice and clean,  Pretty much this figure alot like the CW Motormaster in all regards except in certain aspects like the head-sculpt for both his robot mode and his torso mode to some coloring as well some mold detail been change here and there, but you can see some similarity like his arms and legs ( the core chest of there combine torso mode is also different, where for Menasor looks like Galvatrons chest from the Transformers AoE, Ultra Primes is more base to his Transformers  Energon Optimus Prime Super Mode). Transformation to his vehicles to robot to torso mode is very simple and very straight forward since pretty much is the same like CW Motormaster so everyone can jump in quick.  Accessory that it comes with are 2 gun rifles ( one been the more traditional Optimus Rifle and the other been base like in the Transformers movies) which they combine to form a long rifle which is kind silly. Interestingly enough, both rifles are molded as half of an engine block to each other that at first you could think you might be able to combine them into 1 full engine block, but sadly is not possible and i feel this is a miss opportunity. It also comes with a collectors card and as usual the issues still persist in this one, it comes with a nice artwork base on the mobile and thick like a credit card, sadly the back has the autobot logo with no stats or bio as usual.  Now here comes the part that disappointed me, since this is the same mold to Motormaster this one will have the same flaws for torso mode since they share the same engineering. Like the torso mode for Menasor, Ultra Prime' s torso mode is very bad looking in proportions, transformation is pretty much the same just open the truck cabin revealing Ultra Prime's head and flip it up, bend the legs to the sides in a mounting position and flip Optimus arms around where the ports for the combiner would end up up and your done. I understand that the target audience is for kids i really do, but again i feel that this is really bad made for such an audience and even if it was for collectors as well. The engineering and the proportion of Ultra Prime's torso mode was sacrifice heavily that is disappointing in comparison to Superion's torso mode outclass him (heck even CW hotspot torso mode for Defensor outshines both Menasor and Ultra Prime by far). There is a way to make Ultra Prime look decent, just like i did with Menasor leave the legs in his regular position flip it around from the hip move it 1 click back and compress Ultra Prime's body (using his transformation to vehicle mode) as a way to feel any gap just to try to make the torso look decent at least. Sadly the since this mold is the same as Motormaster it has the same flaw for the torso mode which is the peg post on his chest, this peg post are suppose to be use to attach legends figure like Blackjack, Thundercraker, Windcharger, ect. But since is the same mold it has the issue of that extra indentation in the peg post which needs to be sanded down or cut along the line so legends figure could tab properly and not get damage in the process.  Another issue is unlike Superion and Menasor Ultra Prime has no actual members to speak off. This means you need to borrow some members from other combiners that has extra members like example alpha bravo and offroad (this is in the assumption you have quickslinger and Breakneck) and still Ultra prime is missing 2 more to be fully complete it. Now it was confirm by Hasbro that 4 new combiner limbs are in the works and they were reveal to be Prowl, Mirrage, Sunstreaker and ironhide, this team member combine with Ultra Prime makes a reference and a nod to a classic episode of the G1 transformes which is know as the Masquerade episode. In this episode Prime, Jazz, Mirrage, Sideswipe and Windcharger camouflage themselves as the stunticons and are able to form a fake Menasor, it might not be exactly with the members (with the only 2 been Prime and Mirrage) but its a nice nod to it which is pretty cool. Always wonder how in that episode Prime would look like as  a combiner and i guess this is as close as we are getting it.  Now here is an interesting thing,  while both Menasor and Ultra Prime torso mode have the same mold, Ultra Prime feels to me more build solid than Menasor. All joints are solid and areas that need to tab will tab in place unlike my Menasor which it doesn't tab very well. I can combine all the limbs on Ultra Prime and move them around and they will remain secure. In fact, im incline to say that the mold of Motormaster was done second and that the Optimus Prime mold was done first even though Motormaster was announce first with Superion,perhaps is my copy but a lot of people has said the same thing, weird huh?.  Overall CW voyager Optimus Prime has a nice looking vehicle and robot mode as well a more solid combiner torso mode, but again it comes that its major component been a torso mode suffers from disproportions like menasor since they share molds. Still wish Hasbro would have done a better job with it like what they did with Superion and Defensor . but other than that its a good figure, not perfect but good.

I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this figure, and aside from a few minor disappointments she is a great figure in my opinion.  First off, due to the parts (re)used to make them, Angella happens to be one of the shorter Princess of Power figures, and her daughter, Glimmer, is one of the tallest in the line.  Put them together, and the height difference is pretty obvious.  It's a minor quibble, and I suppose genetics-wise it is possible, even though Angella was definitely taller than her daughter in the cartoon.  I plan on putting Angella on a flying stand, so hopefully that will hide the size discrepancy a bit.  Secondly, and this is a mixed bag, Mattel finally seems to be attempting to fix the ""leotards that look more like skirts"" issue by gluing down the pink crotch piece.  Aesthetically, the result looks closer to a leotard, bit it does limit Angella's leg/hip movement a bit. I guess I'm glad they made the attempt, but it doesn't quite work. Aside from that, Angella has the standard articulation that the other females in the line have, plus her gorgeous articulated wings!  The wings are the highlight of this figure, and they are beautifully sculpted, with nice feathered details. (If you own a DCUCs Hawkgirl, you will recognize the reused sculpt.) They have a ""hinge"" on her back, so they can be moved back and forth, as well as joints about halfway so they can be unfurled to an impressive wingspan.  There is a peg at the top, so you can clip her pink halo on the back, or you can keep it off, depending on which look you prefer.  Angella's other accessory is her sword, which is two-tone silver.  She doesn't have a shield, unfortunately.  One thing to look out for is that many of these figures seem to have had trouble with the eye paint- some of them look cross-eyed as a result, which is unfortunate.  The face paint on mine is not perfect, but it isn't too far off the mark.

Because the two characters are printed on separate parts of the tin, they can interact with each other, and because the case is so thin (about a quarter inch thick, total) they can also be played with on a variety of surfaces.  The main downside is in the poor quality of the magnetic strips... Like many similar toys, the magnetic charge is weak and the pieces may wind up getting lost. Likewise, the paper they're attached to is pretty flimsy, so if any bending occurs, the pictures get rumpled and discolored, and the paper fronts may detach more easily than you'd like, particularly if the pieces get wet. If these parts were just a little more durable, this could be a great toy.",No dwarves...?,1184889600,,old-fashioned play ferrous character wet like clothes toy could sleep concept strip get modern many poor playtime inch great surface downside well size box thick front little charge picture one show change back quality prince similar separate durable lose jacket rumple discolored detach likewise fit thin variety cool version occur magnetic disney's flimsy metal particularly part cigarette paper also weak inside bend front easily except doll main case pretty two beauty total attach wind printed stay quarter get do they're die-cut piece toy tidily may small picture interact tin

We also figured out very early on that while giving 3 answers was manadatory , going above 3 again increased the likelihood that those answers would not be matched. We all learned to give the most obvious answers and not many of them so that the Doodle wouldn't win. When we finally got that down and were able to win the game became really boring and predictable.

When the guitar first arrived it went out of tune fairly quickly, but after giving the strings time to stretch, it now stays in tune as long as we'd expect for a small guitar with nylon strings. (It did come with a note that told us to expect this.) The highest three strings are nylon and the lower three are the traditional metal. The plastic is gentler on the fingers of a beginner or very occasional player, but does have a little bit of a different sound.  It's got a nice gloss. The front is somewhat darker and more orange than I expected from the photo, and the sides and back brighter red. Mine has a small flaw on the front that looks like a bit of a paint smudge under the gloss, and the Martin Smith label on the interior has started to peel away over the couple of months we've owned it.

However, they can't write directions for beans.  Not one whit.  There were even visuals, but they were useless.  For the life of me I couldn't find the ""catch"" they mentioned, a catch that would release the double protective photo sheet so I could slide it out.  I pored over it and saw nothing.  The frames were sealed on three sides and no way could I open them.  Then I had the ah ha moment.  I decided to make a short video to show just where this catch is.  The video is a bit wobbly when I use my letter opener because I'm filming with the other hand, but you'll definitely find that catch the next time you look.  The catch is in the corner of each frame, just below the bee's head.  When you use a nail file or similar object, insert it and slide it toward the head.  A small yellow tab will move.  It does come up slightly above the frame.  With my other hand, I grasped the double protective photo sheet and pushed it up toward the head.  I could then remove it, put my pictures in, and put them back in.  It was easy once I figured it out, but it wasn't intuitive.  Recording the sounds is quite simple.  Here the directions are clear and easy.  This is a marvelous, innovative frame and quite busy bee adorable.  No, TOMY can't write directions for beans, but I really, really love this frame.  It's perfect for little ones who have deployed parents, grandparents, family, or friends who don't live nearby.

383,643139,5,121.0,False,"08 22, 2012",A35Y0RSU09ANEN,B0083TXY08,,Peter B. Nelson,"First off, let me say that my kids, age 6, 5, and 3 were so excited when they saw this thing come out of the box they practically rioted. In our house we have a saying, ""so fun it causes crying"", and the Nerf Vortex Pyragon with 40 disc drum magazine meets that standard and then some.  Opening it up, the first thing I noticed was that the drum magazine looked like it might fit our old Nerf gun, the Vortex Praxis. Sure enough, the magazines are interchangeable. And for an awesome bonus, the Pryagon accepts the Praxis shoulder stock, too. See my photo.  After giving the kids a turn and getting them out of the way I got to practice a little geek science on this baby. I dug out my professional chronograph (the Chrony Alpha) and was thrilled to find it could take readings from these toys.  After 40 shots the stats are these: the Pyragon shoots the discs at an average feet-per-second of 50.6FPS, at the muzzle, with a standard deviation of 2.3FPS. Each disc weighs 39.1 grains, yielding a muzzle energy of 0.22 foot pounds. [sidenote: a modest pellet gun can shoot an 8 grain lead pellet at 530fps, yielding 5.0 foot pounds] I also tested our year-old Nerf Vortex Praxis: it produced only 43.7FPS with a standard deviation of 3.9FPS (0.17 foot pounds). Unless someone sends me a new one, though, I cannot say whether the poorer performance of the Praxis is innate to gun itself or due the wear and tear of a year's hard use.  The Pyragon advertises slam fire, and I am happy to report it works just as well as advertised. I can shoot 10 rounds in a third as many seconds, putting every one on a six inch target at 10 feet.  I'm sure hundreds of reviewers have written about the virtues of the new Nerf Vortex discs versus the old darts, so I will only say that after trying both with my kids I prefer the discs for distance, accuracy, marksmanship training, and rate-of-fire. But then again, the suction cups on the darts are super fun for shooting at windows. It's best to have both.  I rated this ""5 star"" for educational value and I just want to explain that: it's because we use this toy to teach gun safety and handling. Our rule is never to shoot (or even point) the gun at anything other than a target. Violation of this rule means the gun gets put away for a day. I know they'll shoot at each other when they get older but I think it's never too soon to ingrain safe gun practices. Furthermore, the Vortex system is accurate enough that the guns can be used to teach basic marksmanship. We line up little toy soldiers on the floor, and pick them off. It's a great father-son (and father-daughter) activity. So there you go: it's more than fun, it's educational!

As usual, I played a practice game by myself to get a feel for the rules and help with teaching the game later. I wasn't too sure if my game group would like the game after doing this because I got this sort of  ""meh"" feeling. I liked the army mechanic within the game, but the rest failed to excite me. This extra board game sense I have aquired over the years could not be any more wrong.  Then came the normal mental battles of anybody who has played a good worker placement game. Frustration of being blocked out of spaces, decisions of what is more important getting the card that gives me a scroll each round or army to get cards with more points or geez I could use some more coin... Players strategically placing their numbered meeples to block others from using certain actions was cutthroat, but no less than we have played in games like Stone Age.  The unique (to us) Army mechanic was definitely the best part of the game to me and also a viable way to victory. A player only went for military and won a game. Another had a good mix of military and empire points also won a game and yet another focused only on their empire also did very well. I also thought the army mechanic rules were going to be tough to follow, but an explanation that worked well was: You can't retire an army that is off fighting for you and they are too tired to fight again if they already battled something this round.  Other Pros: It was easy to teach with very little fiddly rules. Scoring was also very easy to understand, the board was beautiful and yet not complicated to look at. Cards are delightful to look at and easy to understand the icons. Usually our run time limit for a game is 90minutes, each 4 player game we played took a little over an hour...perfect. The order in which things happen each round is simple to follow and there isn't an overwhelming amount of choices, but just enough.  The only cons I could see were were fairly minor. The cards are flimsy and I would have liked better quality material used. I found it odd that a coin is used as the round marker. Couldn't one of those coins on the punch sheet been designed as something different to look at for a round marker? Another player picked it up asking whose coin it was and realized right away after she did it that it was the round marker. The Empire cards seemed a bit off balance. I could care less about using the ""I can place a meeple on the Get Another Meeple Space even if somebody else is there"", but I needed the card to be able to add more to my empire. Whereas the next card power flipped was so much more universally useful to all players. Some kind of secret points would have been nice too. I found myself looking over at other players and adding up their points in my head during the game. Other than storing cards, not much of anything secret going on.  Overall, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun medium weight worker placement game.",I wasn't too sure if my game group would like the game after doing this because I got this ...,1466553600,,feel player aquired age sheet nice retire away power card play much use thought action amount head mechanic focus ask teach way like come flip understand order fight cutthroat space extra recommend space player round practice could add usually coin search usual useful mental others medium punch worker normal realize next rule group anybody can't scroll get meeples important follow pro point enough within meeple explanation con secret limit meh definitely sure tired something already simple somebody unique different placement teaching later feel viable marker whose go good less find fairly seem store fun fiddly little minor thing one frustration like part balance need quality army place right wrong odd sense beautiful battle material go able kind good give take work used add strategically card bit game score certain weight help time sort fail military narrowed get would complicate block flimsy game also choices see even rest easy stone else mix year hour...perfect pick design delightful whereas best overall decision block yet excite look battle run board fight icon universally overwhelm happen tough use well geez empire get victory another placing coin look anything numbered care

I appreciated that even if my little one was running exuberantly across the room and fell and smacked his face on this, it's soft enough not to cause any damage beyond a cry of surprise.  While the two buttons which make noises are both loud enough to be a little annoying after the 15th press, I have to say both were very appropriate. One makes starting up sound and flashes all of the lights in the front, and the other one makes a siren wail. My little one is not old enough yet to understand that he should push the button to make it start up, then pretend to bring it around the house while pushing the siren button periodically. But what he did love was zooming around with it and rolling it on the floor. He also loved pushing each button and looked up to me with a great big grin after each one made its noise and flashing lights. He also enjoys spinning the wheels and watching them zoom in circles.  The only thing that I don't like about this toy is that the entire bottom is hard. When I think of something that is soft and squeezable, I hope that when I get bashed in the face with it, it won't hurt. Unfortunately, my little one keeps grabbing the top and trying to smack me in the face with the bottom, which is not at all soft. That said, there does need to be a place for batteries to go and for the wheels to lock-in, so on balance it's hardly a fair criticism.

The pieces may appear smooth but actually may not be and once the ball is together, you cannot go back and smooth it out.  Turning it and looking inward (where the numbers are) is the only way to make sure it's nice and smooth.  The pieces of the puzzle are numbered and there are arrows, if you want to cheat. That would take the fun out of it for me, but you can also use the number to be sure that the pieces have been put together properly.  I think it's beautiful and colorful and fun.

Once I pulled it out she latched on to it as her favorite toy.  She loves it so much that I went out and bought the ""Pig"" version to have as a back-up just in case something happened to the bug.  She is now three months old and still absolutely loves it.

Whenever we go somewhere, we have to take this toy with us (as well as at least one of the Sassy Go Go Bugs, and the Classic Pooh Flat Blankie Teether Toy).  There are two reasons that I can't give this toy five stars, but honestly they're both minor issues.  Even at three months, my daughter can't quite pull it hard enough to make the music herself.  She has a very strong grip and can pull pretty hard too (for a baby), but we still have to pull it for her.  It would be nice if it took less of a pull to turn on the music.  The other reason is the battery life.  The bug version has lasted about a month but now the battery is dying so it will play one tune, but dies halfway through the second tune and then starts over at the first (it forgets where it is at) when you pull it again.  Granted, it has been used A LOT because she loves it -- but I would have expected the battery to last a bit longer.  The bug is now relegated to the changing table for short entertainment during diaper changes and we now travel with the Pig.

She has exhibited at Maker Faires and Robotics Expos in the Omaha area with things she has made that relate to circuits, robotics and green design. She decided to do a video review for this product that she received for a birthday gift from a friend. The video speaks for itself as to how fun the product truly is, and you can see what others are talking about. She did the project on her own. She took her time and was not in a hurry when assembling it.  You can see her video at https://diy.org/robotmakergirl/989648  This was her second Robotikits kit. The first one being the Solar Recycler which she thought was horrible. This one was I admit better quality than the Solar Recycler Kit was and they have improved since they made that one. For the money I would recommend, even for teens, to get the knex robotic building sets as at least those are a fun build, and can be rebuilt into other things. They too have a motor, gears, and battery pack so you are getting the same thing just in a more user friendly format. If you are looking for a step up into more robotics. My daughter has enjoyed the Maker block programmable robot kit that uses an Arduino type format and block style programing. Yes it is it much more expensive than this, but if you are looking to learn programing, electronics and robotics that will at least teach you something. I do not recommend for kids under 10 years old and even so they will need help. Like I said she has quite a bit of building experience and found this not a fun build and a lack luster result. This is more like a toy with TONS of assembly required and when finished it just turns in circles, wobbles or walks, (not very well, until it falls and breaks into pieces that need to be assembled again.) It does not ""teach"" about robotics. The ""eductational"" portion would be to teach kids how to read difficult black and white photo instructions. No educational information was included. If you want to teach circuits start with a wobble bot, or vibrobot tutorial on youtube and save money by buying a small motor or digging one out of an old vibrating toothbrush.

I'd say this T.S. Shure blocks are somewhere in between those two block-building levels. Like the Melissa and Doug set they are smooth, solid and high quality. I'm not sure if they quite match the heavy, heirloom-quality of the Melissa and Doug set, but they come fairly close. They also come in a wooden case which looks good but, unlike the Melissa and Doug case, it's only two layers deep, and with lots of tiny blocks that must be painstakingly put in just so in order to all fit, the storage reuse is more limited, though my son has found other good uses for the nicely-made, large wooden tray.  The T.S. Shure set, unlike the Melissa and Doug set, comes with far smaller blocks--small enough you should keep them away from kids little enough to still be putting things in their mouths--allowing for more elaborate builds. It also includes both primary colored and natural blocks that can be mixed and matched in your projects. And, best of all, as far as my son is concerned, it comes with a visual instruction guide for some pretty elaborate builds.  My son started with the Empire State building and was super proud of it. Even more so because he had to persevere though several rebuilds when he wasn't patient enough during construction and ended up knocking things over. Once complete, it really did look very impressive and was perfectly suited for his age range, or even beyond.  I'd say this is a great set for building-enthuiast kids from about 4-10, with its sweet spot for long-lasting play probably in the 5-6 age. Frankly, I was worried my son might feel these were too young for him when he saw these were ""just blocks,"" but as soon as he saw the detailed and complicated instructions he was very enthusiastic. (At 7, he's hit the age where he's deeply concerned about appearing ""babyish"" in anything he plays with.)  Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of these blocks, the intricacy of the designs and the included instructions.

I have two daughters, ages 3.5 and 2, and a son on the way, and I KNOW this will be a popular toy in our house for years to come. It came wonderfully packaged and luckily, only minor assembly was required which my husband knocked out in a couple minutes with an automatic drill. You can see all the pieces in one of the photos I posted - the boat itself came in one piece. It is beautifully crafted and so incredibly sturdy. There are so many bolts reinforcing the piece, and the entire thing is solid wood. Besides maybe some dings here and there from rough play, I honestly can't think of any part of the bulk of this boat that could even possibly break since it's so well made.  The assembly required included attaching the 'rocking' portion of the base. If you wanted it to be stationary, I suppose you could even get away with setting those pieces aside and having no assembly. BUT the rocking part is really cute and as I mentioned, the assembly was easy. It also doesn't rock uncontrollably or anything, so although children might have to watch their toes around it, there's minimal opportunity for any injury with this toy.  In the photos, you'll see that my 3.5 and 2 year olds can both fit.  A couple things to note: - The wheel spins - The flag on the back is not attached and is wood - not flexible at all. Sure you could glue it in place but I think we'll probably remove it completely instead. It's a really cute touch but honestly it seems as though it could be the one and only thing that might break. Obviously speculation, but again, we'll probably end up removing it so it doesn't break. Because of the placement and angle, perhaps it could have been made of different material (foam and cloth? all foam?) - The cover on the back 'storage' area (It has a cute little map on it) is also not attached. It just sits in place. It doesn't fall off or move around. Because there's a map on it, I think it's cute that a child could pull that piece off and pretend to be looking at the map. - It also comes with a plastic telescope, felt pirate hat and a foam sword. It's a really great touch that these are included. I do have to say, the hat doesn't fit my 3.5 year old. It's felt but firm, so it's not really possible to reform - it kind of just pops back up.  I couldn't be more impressed with this boat, overall. As I mentioned above, I know this is something that will be a favorite in our house for years, and will probably even be a toy we keep for our kids to give to their kids, because I just do not see toys made this well very often! This is on par with something someone with woodworking skills would make for a child! This is definitely the highest quality and nothing you'll find in a standard toy store.

This deluxe Orion Pax figure comes packed with a variant of IDW Comics' ""Spotlight: Orion Pax"" for the same price as previous deluxes that had no comics, nice deal. This cover art is the Retailer Incentive character art for that original issue but on a different background and closer-up. The character art on the cover, I really dislike it, it doesn't look like the toy, it doesn't look like the character in the book, it looks like a haggard old man.  This figure is Orion Pax from the IDW comic series, the issue is from December of 2012, about half a year before this figure came out in July.  The vehicle is too simple, hollow, and incomplete in the back, but not awful and has some nice touches. Transformation is very interesting, something new in how things flip around, but also can lead to variance that requires massaging to get vehicle right. The axe accessory just plugs onto the side of the vehicle, nothing clever at all, and the gun can do the same or plug into a 5mm gap in the axe head. Paint on my sample has the Autobot logo off-center. The truck has clear lineage with the vehicle in the book, but the cab is smaller, less integrated to the vanes in the back by being set forward, and the midsection is heavily indented, so the toy is definitely more a pickup truck than that of the comic.  Robot mode is almost a cross between Orion and Optimus in how much bulk is carried to the legs and chest, it has more of that heroic proportion, but the face saves it with a very youthful look. The head is small and has light-piped eyes ending in blue paint, that's weird. The chest is a big windshield with an interior techno-chest and an Autobot logo. The shoulders don't lock onto the torso as much as I'd like, but are ok. Transformation is fun once you get the order of the chest and backpack-wheels down, but relies heavily on the whole vehicle front end and sides as stacked shell parts dumped onto the boots. Orion feels pretty small and light, but has good articulation to be fairly expressive. His gun is a fat version of the classic Optimus blaster and looks very nice, almost too much for a youthful character like this. The axe looks good with a translucent orange head and black-painted handle that has a 5mm grip in the middle and a peg on the side of the axe head.  Overall, Orion Pax is not a bad figure, but proportional issues and a bit too much reliance on shell hold it back from all it could be.

We have bins and bins of them, starting with the old school construction sets.  We also own all the dinosaurs that came out a few years back.  They are similar to these dinosaurs, but they did not come with all this FUN battle gear.  Pros:  -Easy packaging.  It was very easy to get the toy out of the package. -Fun to play with - Very imaginative -Educational - Everyone marked it down in educational, but taking everything off and on, figuring out how everything works, that is a challenge for a little guy, and I think that teaches a nice skill. -Durable - We have owned all the Transformers, Nerf guns, ATV ride-ons etc., and our Imaginext are the only toy that I would recommend with a 5 star for durability.  In the hundreds of pieces that we own, we have only ever had 3 break.  We had a piece break off a whale, a leg off the giraffe, and a leg off a jaguar.  We have not yet had a dinosaur break. -They come with the batteries! And if the batteries die, they are still fun to play with. -Big, but not too big.  They are big enough for little hands to play with, but not too big to be unmanageable.  Spike, the remote control dinosaur was too big for a little guy to manage. -I love that it comes with so many pieces.  You can buy additional pieces, but this is a lot of pieces, so it should give a lot of playing fun.  Cons:  -The cockpit lid seems to pop off a little too much.  It is easy to get back on, but they could have probably fixed the design. -I also think the front battle gear that hooks to the arms is a little tricky for the little guys.  However, my 5 year old did fine.  My four year old struggled a little.  My final review gives this toy 5 stars.  They have taken their old design (which all the neighborhood kids come over to our house to play with), and added the fun battle gear and guy.  I love that the guys are interchangeable with the sets, and the gear for the guys swaps.  It is very nice if your kids have several sets and swap around.  I would definitely choose these over any other toy on the market.  My kids love them and they are durable.  Also, we have a couple of the large Fisher Price remote control things (spike, and the cave man), and I wouldn't recommend those.  Their batteries stop holding a charge.  This guy takes regular batteries, and as I pointed out before, it not only comes with the batteries, but if they die you can continue to play with this toy.

Some, but not all, of these miniatures might be suitable for use with Fantasy Flight Games' X-Wing.  X-Wing's scale is 1/270, as described by Fantasy Flight:  ""As we set out to design our miniatures and our game system, we needed to choose the scale of the game. Too big, and the gameplay would be unwieldy and take up too much space. Too small, and wed lose unacceptable amounts of detail, and the models wouldnt have the physical presence on the tabletop we were seeking. After creating a series of crude rapid prototypes in various sizes, we finally chose 1/270 as our final scale. At this size it was possible to maintain most of each starfighters fine details while also making it possible for those players interested in staging larger battles to field a significant number of fighters on the gaming tabletop.""  The supposed scale of the Hot Wheels line is 1/64. Given that this set includes the Millennium Falcon, a Tie Fighter, Slave 1, a Snowspeeder, an X-wing, and the Ghost, this isn't possible..  Wookiepedia gives us their length in meters:   Ghost: 43.9 meters  Millennium Falcon: 34.75 meters  Slave 1: 21.5 meters  T-66B X-wing starfighter: 12.5 meters  TIE/LN starfighter: 8.99 meters  T-17 airspeeder (AKA snowspeeder): 4.5 meters  Given the size of the Ghost and the snowspeeder, the scale is bound to be off. That's okay though, as these toys are for kids to play with.  In case that wasn't clear, they include ""flight navigators"" which are plastic bases that double as a means of flying the ship around on your finger.  With the upcoming Star Wars movie and recent Star Wars Reads Day, kids are primed to love everything from the movie and these little ships make perfect stocking stuffers.

He has S107Gs in yellow, blue and red, the USCG S111G, the Blackhawk S102G, the Apache S109G, the Chinook S026G, the S108G Cobra and maybe a couple other non-SYMA craft too...  When asked to review the Chinook in comparison to the others, he said 'it is totally different that the Apache or Cobra, it is not made for speed and attacking. It is challenging to learn how to balance, but you really get the feel for flight once you get the hang of it. It is easy to picture a load of marines or a load of cargo being hauled around with it. It's cool!'  Since he had experience with other SYMA choppers, it took him about a day's worth of play to really master the Chinook's take-off, landing and unique directional flight characteristics. While he totally enjoys them all, and he recommends the S107G or S111G for first time pilots, it is usually the Chinook that lands in the middle of the breakfast table on school mornings...  In our humble opinion, these SYMA mini copters are tough. They are made for indoor use and they get crash landed on stairs, against walls, on kitchen tables, against mantles... even run over by a golden retriever... but they keep on going. More often than not, we misplace a USB charging cord or wear out the hand-held remote transmitter controls before the copter ever fails.  From a parent's perspective, the price-to-fun ratio of these helicopters is absolutely FANTASTIC. They are almost as much fun to watch as they are to fly.

It has 5 of the most popular birds and 3 piggies. The birds all have a soft/rubbery exterior to them which is awesome for safety and durability since you can launch them with the included catapult (that you build). This set has several little scenarios that you can build day by day, and thankfully the catapult is the first build, so you will be ready for the fun immediately. The instructions are simple, clear, and easy to follow, though there is not a LOT of heavy building here (which makes this good for all ages & levels of experience!). I would not recommend this for very young children though (under 5), because it has some tiny parts. But I love the vast array of treasures in here. Forgive me for spoiling the advent aspect of it, but this set includes not only the 5 birds and 3 piggies, but also a few Christmas presents you can build, the rolling wooden contraption that you blow apart in the game (you build that too, and it has wheels!), it also has a little TNT box (does not explode, thankfully!), some bells (molded, not chiming), Santa hats, a ham, an apple, 2 candy canes (one red/white, one green/white), a golden egg, a white egg, and several K'Nex parts including Lego-style bricks of a variety of colors, my favorite being the transparent blue ones that resemble ice, and white ones that resemble snow, staying consistent with this winter theme! This set also includes a generous size build of a Christmas tree that you can use the included stickers on to make it look like it has ornaments & various decorations on it. As you open each door for these treasures on this calendar, the flap/door has instructions for building, and two of the builds are large enough that they included a sheet instead to explain the build. I'd suggest when you are done with this calendar to cut off the flaps with instructions and just tuck them in a bag with the loose parts for this set so it can be enjoyed year-round. All in all, I love love love this set. I think it is the cutest thing I have seen in a long time and it is an absolute delight for Angry Birds fans such as myself. I'm sure this will be treasured by both young and old, and would likely make an excellent collector's item as well.

944,443866,5,42.0,True,"08 26, 2014",A3JSOG7YNNPORW,B0043KJW5M,,K. Garfield,"My wife loves this game.  Perhaps because she won every time she played until just recently.  And who beat her?  Me!  Ill give you her tips when I tell you what to do since I employed them to secure victory, and she tried something different.  Let that be a lesson to you: never branch out.  Never try anything new, or you will suffer.  This is a drafting game.  I hesitate to tell you this since you might take your reading business elsewhere, but I only call it a drafting game because Ive heard others call it that and they sounded real authoritative, so I believed them, and as I explain youll say, of course its a drafting game- you dolt.  Anyway, this game gets me groaning at my own choices early in the game and I keep groaning throughout the game.  But don't get me wrong, I love playing the game and am thrilled when someone accepts my invite to play.  Game Play You get 7 small double-sided gorgeously illustrated boards that you use to track completion of your wonder.  There are three decks of similarly illustrated cards (one for each age.)  Youve got to fish out the cards that aren't needed for the number of players fewer than sever that are playing.  At the beginning of each age you deal out all the cards.  Each person selects a card from their hand to play then passes their hand to their neighbor.  You keep selecting (I mean, drafting) one from a new hand each round until there are only two left in the hand and the last one get discarded.  Do this twice again and the game is over.  Theres three things you can do with the drafted card:   Keep the card for yourself- if you can pay the cost- some are free- you play the card in front of you- these usually help you score points one way or another.   Discard it for money- an especially good idea if you are poor and its costing you and the card you discard is one your neighbor would like   Build a stage of your wonder- that small board in front of you has spaces for cards to slide under them that represent a stage of your wonder youve completed.  The cost you have to pay is on the board (ignore the cost on the card- try to use one your neighbor would like.)  Speaking of neighbors, it matters who you are next to.  If you don't have a resource needed to pay the cost of a card?  If you have some money, you can buy from your neighbor- and buying their doesnt keep them from using it themselves- they want you to use there because they get your money.  But you can only buy from your immediate neighbors (player on either side of you.)  Also, some of the cards give you military presence.  I use that word because you never march troops anywhere, but you get points at the end of each age if your military is more intimidating than your neighbors.  So the war-monger across the table that doesnt matter so long as you have buffer states between you.  While this strategy wasn't sound for France in World War II, it is in this game I think thats because the maker is French.  I hate to tell you what to do but My wife pointed out to- and I always listen when she points things out- that resources are available in the first two ages- these are what you use to pay the cost of cards or phases of your wonder (Incidentally, Ive never seen my wife develop any stage of her wonder.) You will kick yourself if you don't have resources to buy things late in the second and throughout third age.  The Third age could profitably be focused on getting cards that get you the most points.  Its something you can do in your head.  Hrmmm this one is worth 6 to me and that one is worth 9.  My downfall is I think , Yeah but, even though this one is only worth one, if I got another it would be worth 7!  Think Kyle, two cards to get 7 points, one card to get 6, maybe that second card will also get you 6.  Oh yeah, good call.  Theme Personally, I don't get pulled into the theme of cracking the whips that would be required to erect my wonder, despite the eye-candy artwork.  I don't even get pulled into the idea that Im making a barracks or a laboratory, all Im concerned about is the count of symbols at the top of the card.  Im very concerned about the symbols.  Balance This game the score isn't tracked through the game, though you could get a good idea about someones score by looking over their board long enough- and be annoying to the rest of the players because it takes some doing.  All that to say that you don't have an exact idea of who is winning throughout the game.  You know your neighbor is a war-monger, but you know your scientific cards can answer the points they are racking up if only you could get one more tablet!  All that to say, My wife, who nearly always wins, never felt like she was going to until everything was counted up.  Also curious about the game is resource management as it relates to balance.  While it would sure be nice to have enough resources to build some of the buildings in the last age, most are tremendously costly and you can make up for your national economies grand deficiencies not only by buying from your neighbor, but there are free upgrade paths as well.  Say you get a altar in the first age, you can get the temple in the second age for free!  Each card tells you what cards shortcut the cost of it, and what costs it will shortcut for you in the future.  Interaction Interaction is medium.  I say that because I don't think the Everyone chosen a card? counts, but maybe I need to think of introverts taking baby steps.  Towards the end of each age- leading up to the military comparison- accusations of war mongering escalate.  But I do more talking to myself and occasional barb to the person next to me taking the cards I wanted.  Sometimes I tell someone to use a science card my wife wants before they pass her the hand, but I face swift retribution.  Learning Curve Medium.  I say that because of the multiple ways of scoring points.  Until you finish and score a game it could be difficult to conceptualize how your choices will affect the score at the end.  These leads to me lamenting, Ooooh, I see that I could have won the game. How could I have been so careless?  To which my wife compassionately responds, Hindsight is always twenty/twenty.  Downtime Downtime is nominal because everyone takes turns at the same time.  The downtime happens when the person youd never take to Baskin Robins cant choose between the 8 to 2 cards in his/her hand.  I guess you deserve a little down time if you invite them to play this game with you.  Speaking of baby steps, the indecisive will never get better if they don't practice, so if you invite them, my hats off to you, but in the long run, the clerk as Baskin Robbins may thank you.  Otherwise, its a very fast moving game.  I have watched it be very difficult for someone with a 6 year old try to help them play.  That was brutal.  And don't be passing a partial hand even though you know you don't want to choose those cards.  Talk about a mess to try to straighten out.  Whats not to Like? Im a prude.  I confess.  And I took a permanent marker to a couple of the cards.  There was some of that going on in the Expansion too.  But otherwise, I really like this game.  Collateral Endorsement I have not tried to break this out for my kids.  I want to keep the cards nice.  I have been training them with other card games though.  My little two year old now waits for the dealer to be done before she picks up her hand, but I digress.  I did take this on vacation with me and was playing in the hotel lobby and a complete stranger asked if they could play.  Something about the game caught their eye, and who can blame them?  One other thought Its taken me some time to decide why Im so bad at this game.  No, it cant be because so many of my opponents are superior to me, it just cant!  I think it has to do with not being able to see the whole picture.  That is to say, I do very well playing Puerto Rico because I can see all the available options for each player and can guess what I would do if I were in their shoes and can make plans accordingly.  In this game, I see only one hand at a time.  I cant see one of my neighbors hand and know, oh, they are going to get that military card.  Or, maybe this game Ill let the science cards go since so many are going to ge gobbled up before I ever see them.

My husband always hated the overspray on the toilet and floor when spraying out diapers from our 2nd child, and even just one pair of toddler underwear with poop in it from our first child (who took forever to potty train) would have made this worthwhile to me!!!! I sprayed out the first diaper cover with meconium on it when we came home from the hospital with baby #3, but after that passed we didn't really use it for 6 months because she is breastfed and wasn't on solids.  Now she is 10 months and eats a variety of solids in addition to breastmilk and the Spray Pal is a necessary part of our cloth diapering routine!

I leave it snapped open because it is ready when I need it and I use rubber gloves to put the dirty diaper in the clip.

Unfortunately all were pure colorless quartz (just a tiny touch of color in one), but very beautiful little ""quartz caves"" revealed, so not disappointed.  All were split by hammer, as the kids were too impatient to tap at them with a chisel.  Breaking did take a while anyway as it took a number of their sometimes awkward blows.  Also I encouraged them not to just try to smash them with one mighty hit (not that they really could).  They managed to crack them all, including the solid ones, yet left at least one complete half from each (sometimes the other half was split, including a few small fragments).    Only mild downside:  3 of the seven were solid, and a fourth had a small cavity, though the crystals were nice in that small cavity.  With 2 kids, each got to keep two with crystals inside (though of course, by chance, one child actually cracked more with cavities).  One of the solid ones split right down the middle and was kind of interesting in its own right.

We take this game to restaurants in order to kill time, or play it when we just want to kill a few minutes. The game consists of what seem to be durable cards with a letter on each side of the card. They put a letter on each side to maximize the potential for words and they did it in a smart way by putting the letters on the card duplicated in the top corner of each card. The goal of the game is to make four-letter words, so for the most part, young children can play.  Here are some tips: 1) Don't be tempted to start with a hard word that cannot easily be changed. For example, I chose ""iron"" and we were stuck immediately. 2) Because there are letters on the other side of the cards, you can easily forget about them even though they are printed in the top corner. In the heat of the game, consider flipping your hand over entirely when you are stuck as this can help your brain immediately recognize new word combinations. 3) There are 3 blanks included in the deck. These cards are blank on both sides. Consider playing without the blanks because even though it seems valuable to use them as a wild card, we found we'd often forget what we used them for if we didn't replace them right away during the game. 4) My 12-year-old daughter does not put the cards in her hand, but instead lays them out in front of her for easier viewing. 5) Consider handicapping adults by giving them a few extra cards than the kids are dealt.","Quick game, good for traveling -- but I have some tips",1292198400,,deal away hard handicapping card maximize stick heat hand use way like immediately order four-letter extra smart travel adult one young child take seem minute consists duplicate iron combination tempt found flipping letter put word include play daughter entirely part replace change new brain right easier durable consider quick use side card kill recognize game want cannot help time get deck top blank give lay letter corner game potential we'd even start easily front chose kid side make put tip view play blank word forget often instead without though seem valuable print well goal example restaurant wild

It took them 3 MONTHS!!! to correct a closet issue for clothes for your on-line fairies, thus you could not see or use many of the items you had earned through quests and/or clickables and/or bought in the game by collecting items! Even if you have collected items, used the codes from the toys you have bought, there is never enough room for the items you want to keep!  You can call, send reports, suggestions, and there is still never enough room! When there is a problem (that MANY other players are having as well) IF you get a response, it generally consists of ""we're working on it"", OR The problem must be at your end: e.g - When I reported a problem that many other players were having, I was requested to send a report to Pixie Hollow (Disney Interactive)that was a test of my machine, but contained personal info on my PC, the programs on it, etc. two friends who reported the same problem were sent two other reasons for the game not working properly (one was told she hadn't earned a ""Badge"" when she had even sent in a screen shot of it, and was basically called a liar according to her by the staff), then was told the problem must be with her computer.. blah, blah, blah... Another friend who reported the problems was also told at times basically it must be her computer, her settings, and so on.  If you get on the game forum and post anything but nice thoughts about it, they are buried into a ""rant"" section, which you will not know even exists unless you make such a post about the game not working and/or asking when things will be fixed so you can play the game! (AND Pixie Hollow staff will tell you that the forum basically has nothing to do with them (OK right, Disney is going to allow someone else to use their name!?! I think not!) AND if you look at the upload logs in the Wiki for the game, the same online names are used there as the moderators' names for that game and others (They seem to have a skeleton crew staff that attempts to run all of their games, and either because they are stretched to thin or don't know how, the game always has some problem going on. For the 6 months I played, I felt like I got about half of that out of it and was paying for it!  The game should have never left BETA testing, and it seems additions to the game (which are beautiful with what you'd expect from Disney from an art perspective)have such major problems in the game that you simply cannot play the game and enjoy it for more than about a couple of months, then you'll really notice the MAJOR problems of not enough storage space, quests not functioning properly for paid members, and run into walls where you simply cannot do any of the objectives of the game, or buy other things you'd like for your home, no more clothes, even though they release a LOT of things all at once, and you may have earned enough to buy things, there is simply not enough room for the items, and you have to delete something!  There are places where you can make your own clothes and household items, buying dyes and choosing your own colors for things you've already seen in the game, which is a great idea, but is a problem when you do not have room for the items! (I only made I believe 3 clothing items for myself, and two of those had to be deleted because there is simply no room!)  ALSO, items you earn disappear (from cookies you need to go into the wilderness, which for the last more than a week many of us have not been able to access!)  There is a theater where you are supposed to be able to put on a pre-scripted play, but the language and tone of the language of some of the ""famous fairies"" in the quests, the language in the game, the manipulative stories of your child basically being a gofer for especially Tinkerbell, seem to me to teach kids to be targets for bullies.  Bullying DOES go on in the game, and thus I would NOT recommend this game for children at all!  You can have parties at your home, yet the 3 games you can buy often crash (you'll still get the points towards a badge for hosting so many party games, or playing games at other people's parties, but  If you don't want your child (or yourself) subjected to high-pressure sales tactics, and don't want to be frustrated with everything in the game that does not work, then steer away from this game and the toys that interact with it! There is a huge push to buy T-Shirts, etc. with YOUR fairy's picture and name on it.  There are a lot of nice people on the game, but also be aware that there seems to be a population of teens that despite the limited chat talk about seriously inappropriate things on the game for small children to be reading!  The on-line game this item works with I played for about 6 months on subscription. I saw a few glitches at first, but figured it was a fluke and that Disney would get on it and fix the problems right away! Boy! was I wrong!  Every time the on-line game has an update, there are MAJOR problems where you literally cannot play entire portions of the game, IF you can even get logged onto the game and it seems you'll will spend more time sending error reports than you will playing the game, if things continue as they have been for the last 6-7 months.  This game *COULD BE* a blockbuster (AND a REALLY FUN GAME!), and I'm sure with the sales team will sell a LOT of subscriptions (I read somewhere they have 6 MILLION registered accounts already, and this is before the new movie comes out this month) along with the Nintendo DS game that is supposed to interact with this game, and they have already had, since at least last February, glitch after glitch after glitch! They may sell a lot of the new DS games, however it's a game that will likely be in the thrift stores before the year is out!  I'm uncertain if the DS game will be like the Technosource, and only be registerable to one account only, but if it is, I'd avoid that as well...  There are FAR too many free games that are FAR better maintained and operated.  IF you do buy the Clickables, I've read that if you delete a virtual item you get from it, it takes nearly an act of God to get it back if you change your mind, and hours on the phone with the ""Never Council"" as the staff like to refer to themselves. The Clickables charms only give you one item, and you can get badges for ""collecting (buying) them, yet fr those who bought them all, know that there is one left empty in your ""Leaf Journal"" on the game, and I read a post from Disney that says they are no longer making these toys, and there are software problems with loading them as well,which makes for more frustrations for kids (AND even adults) who want to simply play a fun, interactive game!  I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a good on-line game to play with your kids, or simply play the game for free. The codes for ALL the toys you can buy are all listed on a Disney, and other, websites so you can get the codes for the other toys that have the codes for free, without buying the toys (Although Clickables DOES have extras you might like as well, but with so little room in the closets and storage for these and other items, there is plenty to choose from without buying these as well.  I have two account, one paid, and one free, and I found I can do almost everything (and sometimes more with the glitches) on my free account than I can the paid account!!!  This is like Pokemon was years ago... ""BUY MORE STUFF!!!"" Which doesn't seem like a good message to be sending to children, and they get bored with it in a short period of time anyhow. I chat with mostly adults on the game, but have moved onto playing other games that are free and FAR more fun (see myspace, [...] and other places for a LOT of fun games!) [...] has some really cute, free and frankly, more fun games that are non-violent!) You might try Cafe World or Farmville on myspace or other games by Zynga as well on myspace! Then you can choose to buy money (with real money) for your character or not!

Also, imagine her shock when she discovered that they stick to our dishwasher too (aka: her magnetic canvas).

I also like that they are stained and not painted so there's no concerns of paint coming off and they come in a decent variety of colors or plain, unstained wood.  But... I have two complaints: 1. The price. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand the cost but $15 for 4 blocks seems high to me when that's ALL you get; 4 blocks. Which leads me to my second complaint... 2. They don't even have options to buy other shapes separately. You have to buy one of the larger and, of course, more expensive sets to be able to enjoy some of the other interesting shapes. From what I see (even on their website), it looks like you have to cough up at least $60 to get good variety of the pieces. I've already spent $15 so there's no way I'm doing that.  Yes, I could have bought one of the larger sets from the beginning but that's an expensive risk on a toddler who will probably lose some pieces, especially when I didn't know if she'd even like it in the first place.

It comes in its own hard storage tube to tuck away easily when not in use  The Dartboard game is on a sturdy magnetic velvet material. When unrolled it holds its shape well and stays flat.  The top of this does have a string to hang it up.  The darts come in two colors. Red & yellow. They feel very sturdy and are holding up great even after using this a few times with the kids. I like that they have magnets and will not damage the wall.  This does have two sides, each with a different bullseye design.  My 7-year-old twins had a fun time playing with this and the magnets held on much better than I could have imagined. It felt like using real darts with how well they stuck to the board.  The only things I would have liked would have been for this to have been a tad larger, and for the endcaps to be on more securely. The game I received the endcaps were on loose and not hooked as tight as I would have liked.  (I had to push one back on) And I would have loved for this set to have more darts.

What I don't like is how they can easily zone out for hours playing it.  I got them each a red bird and a pig. Little did I know this meant that they would start playing a live action angry birds game!

The LEGO sets are very small, sold in just a single bag. Luckily, they aren't ""blind packs"" so you know what character you're getting.  I ended up buying all of the Series One Mixels when I came across them in a local store. I decided to get them all at once so I didn't end up having to spend an arm and a leg to get that one last one a few months from now when they are no longer to be found in local stores.  Krader is the fifth Mixel that I have built, and so far he might be my favorite.  The build is quick and straightforward, easy to finish, with easy to follow instructions.  I like several of the features that Krader has.  First, his hand is large and has articulation points for each of the fingers, which is neat.  His eyes are googly and actually move around really easily...sometimes just by moving the character around his eyes will move a bit.  Finally, his entire upper torso swivels around so that he can be looking one way, leave his feet in place, and then be looking any other direction.  The build is set up so that it supports the weight of the character no matter what way he is facing.  Very cool.  This is another set that comes with a Nixel, which I think are the bad guys in the Mixel universe.  Oddly enough, I have found it to be fun when I discover that one of these packages includes a Nixel.  I think that one character from each of the ""colors"" comes with a Nixel, and I hope this trend continues with the upcoming releases.  These are fun small sets that will only take an adult a few minutes to build, a child maybe a few more, but ultimately I think that they will provide a good amount of play time for kids due to the way that they move and the funny look that they have.

I make sure I put it in a corner in the playroom because when it's brought into the living room the balls end up under the couch, under the TV stand, etc. - The red button that starts the air and music is easy to press. - The variations in where the balls go make this a lot more fun than other ball poppers.  THE OK  - Assembly wasn't too bad but you do have to put some muscle into it!  The two kids really have a good time with this and I know as the baby gets older she'll continue to have even more fun (beyond giggling and watching in fascination and intermittently playing with the balls my 3 year old hands to her).",Be prepared for lots of squeals and giggles,1316044800,,know squeal chase she'll air month go play baby stick couch hand assembly bring button ear like red ball start reload might playroom room shape press sure hand well music ok intermittently fun put really variations one play playschool love lot fascination whole try pull beyond muscle good popper cup ball first bit laughs time love popper guess mommy living corner etc bad even easy ball-tivity bottom endlessly tv giggle kid make watch play run continue around two often old though end center go year busy get old stand

It comes apart way to easily. The clear plastic piece that holds in the colored numbers and notes chart falls off constantly. The mouth piece pops off, which is nice for cleaning it but not for playing, and the rest simply slides apart. Again, this is great when you want to clean the thing (learning kids will spit all over it) but while they are playing it's constantly ""breaking"" as the kids will tell you.  2. Learning curve with no included instructions. Learning to get your lips puckered correctly and vibrating is tricky and could use some step by steps. On top of that if the thing falls apart when you unpack, as ours did, you may be fiddling with it for a sec to figure out exactly how it's supposed to go back together.  If you go to the site you'll find these helpful instructions: 1. Ask a grown up to remove all packaging, 2. Carefully insert mouthpiece in hole at the top, 3. Pick up your PBuzz and enjoy making musical fun. -_-  Now I know how to play horns and didgeridoos (not well but... I can make loud noises for sure) so I was able to walk my 7 year old through the technique. She had it figured out in about 10 minutes. However after a few more minutes she pulled the trumpet away from her mouth to say ""listen to this dad!"" and the mouth piece popped off, the sliding piece fell through the bell and then the clear plastic popped off as well.

I am a hobbyist when it comes to professional grade art supplies,so I am going to be honest. I have watched so many YouTube vids about Copics and Touch5 markers and Ciaos; as much as I would like their extensive set of various shades my purse was not having it, so I looked around and found Ohuhu. They are alcohol based which means they will blend really well and won't bleed(very much).  I purchased the 40 pack (they are randomized), so it is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. BUT it does come with a wide range of shades for most colors. I used about 3/4 of my set to color the 2 pics attached. This is my first time actually sitting down to use them and I really like them.  The only ""bad"" things I have to say is that the one flesh toned marker that I got was a little dry when I opened it (which has happened to some others that have reviewed these markers), so I knew going in it was going to be hit or miss. Still kind of upset it had to be my one flesh tone though. (That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5). And one other thing is that the label on a couple markers is smeared (you can see in pic), it's still legible so I am not too beat up about it. The markers do have a thick chisel tip and a fine tip on either end. These are not brush tips, but the fine tip works ok for small details anyways. (The pics attached are tiny drawings.  Other than that, these markers are a great alternative to the more expensive alcohol based markers out there especially for as many as you get. It also comes in a very heavy duty canvas zipper bag which it great for storage. I would suggest a heavier grade paper though, it will eat up thin computer paper (but that's all alcohol markers).

However, over the lifespan of this figure in action figure form I have been rather disappointed. Most of the 3.75 figures made by Hasbro over the years seemed to have some design flaw, that made me either pass by buying the figure. or very disappointed when I received it. In the past, my biggest gripes were the lack of articulation. When I saw this figure from Revoltech I knew this figure would deliver in this department and it definitely does.  Good: Articulation- Like I mentioned before, I have always been in the market for a very articulated Bobba figure, and I knew Revoltech would deliver. This figure has Revoltech trademark ball joints all over the place that gives this figure a vast range of movement. There are double Revoltech joints on the neck and head (yes they are underneath the helmet and his neck sleeve, VERY COOL!) and both of his shoulders. I really like this feature on the head because it allows you to get some very life like head poses like leaning the head forward while looking up which adds some great realism to poses like taking aim with his blaster rifle. These double joints allow for some goo range of movement on the shoulders as well. This figure has single Revoltech on the waist (torso) both wrists, both elbows, both legs, both knees, both ankles, and even on both of his pouches on his belt. The range of articulation on this guy is top notch. In addition his Range finder on his helmet is articulated (just a simple swivel joint). The cape and Wookie braids on his shoulders, and the pistol holster on his belt. are made of a softer plastic which ensures they don't inhibit the articulation or posing.  Accessories: This figure comes with his 2 weapons: blaster rifle and blaster pistol. Both are painted, scultped and detailed well. This pistol fits in the holster every well with relative ease, and due to the soft plastic of the holster the risk of paint rub is greatly minimized. The stock on the blaster rifle is articulated in a way that you can better expose the pistol grip when putting it in the figures hands, which is awesome!. This figures comes with 3 sets of hands ( fist hands, trigger hands, open/ cradling hands).All of these hands are very easy to swap out, and the trigger hands hold the weapons very securely. The jetpack is removable. The belt piece is removable if you take him apart at the waist.  In addition this figure comes with display stand components, but no base piece which is weird.  Sculpt/ Paint/ Detail: This figure is beautiful. It should be noted that Revoltech, makes slightly stylized versions of the characters they depict in the action figure form, so even though this isn't a ""Hot Toys-esque"" life like representation of Bobba, it is is still beautiful. The paint and detail on the figure is flawless. The sculpted detail on this figure really brings it to life.  Not so Good:  It bugs me that you can't sling his rifle. The MAFEX figure of Bobba has a rifle sling, I wish this one had it as well.  For the price point, it would have been nice to have a few more accessories. Out of the all the Revoltech figures I have purchased, this one was the lightest in this regards. Some jet boost attachments for his jetpack, blast effects for his guns, or a flame attachment for his flamethrower would have really knocked it out of the park. In addition, this figure stand is missing the most key component: the base of the stand itself, I don't understand why this wasn't included.  While the articulation is great on this figure, it does take away from the realism of it. To be fair, this comes with the territory, when it comes to Revoltech figures in general. Overall I think the design does a pretty good job at masking the articulation (in regards to some of the other Revoltechs I have), but I think some improvements could have been made. The shoulders is where this is the most showing. In certain poses it looks like, parts of Bobba's shoulders are missing due to the Revoltech joints and design. I thinke they could have better used the shoulder pads to mask this, but oh well.  NOTE: For those not familiar with the Revoltech brand, all of their figures (this one included) are built around their trademarked Revoltech Joint. The Revoltech joint is a a ball joint, consisting of two half spheres that snap together with a peg attached to each end. In some cases 2 of these joints are joined together by a peg, which are double Revoltech joints. People either love these or hate these, and your feelings in regards to this ussually is the determining factor in buying one of these figures. These joints are tight and click or ""ratchet"" into place, and are not free-floating like a lot of ball joints or swivel joints found on other figures. I personally love these joints because they are sturdy, and easy to repair if they come apart, in addition to not losing their tightness over time. The only difficulty is when posing you have to kind play a game between adjusting the positions of different joints in regards to the other when trying achieve complex poses like cradling a rifle. It is sometimes  time consuming but once you have it adjusted right the pose is solid and locked in. For me, it is worth the patience.  Summary: I love this figure. I think it knocks the Hasbro black series 1:12 scale (same scale as this figure) out of the water. For any Bobba Fett fan this is a cool addition to any collection, and for a Bobba figure collector it is a defenite must. I am so happy that I was able to pick up a Bobba Fett figure that captures the awesomeness of this character so well.","Finally, the Bobba I have always wanted!",1509580800,,collector rub blaster bug ensure understand knee factor market figure scale cradling articulated pose tight get many allow buying different flamethrower oh light toys-esque knock happy range seem trigger waist really accessories park right point try yes kind version neck difficulty would fit boost familiar regard mask water receive sphere jet pistol bobba click either ankle build saw elbow overall two risk greatly expose note every relative guy wish case determine away plastic notch black base character like could come character take awesomeness open hold apart hands).all can't due torso effect paint definitely goo defenite well representation flame one personally love mask make repair securely snap give worth certain add time hate purchase component patience top pad general game position still pose swivel aim year fist big rifle paint put minimized pas thinke mafex though figure allow always adjust lock realism rather nice weird note head component pose belt territory ball however half think hot job helmet ratchet take lose slightly joint hand shoulder must find huge brand set movement series blast lot gripe place peg beautiful able good single pouch use design come part sometimes inhibit lifespan braid form revoltech piece awesome trademark fett department softer attach swap life flaw sculpt know free-floating shoulder well look stand removable sleeve look revoltechs detail wrist ease complex double way feeling feature knock sling holster attachment articulation tightness bobba's action join soft attachment vast sturdy pick addition weapon great disappointed solid simple lean adjust achieve brings include wookie play miss show summary underneath stylize cape depict mention detailed consuming together gun collection lack price jetpack cool trademark display scultped fair ussually fan key even easy flawless deliver joint forward hasbro consist capture stock around end make people sculpt past leg finder grip improvement pretty

I was a little hesitant to purchase this after reading several reviews about the blue paint coming off. I will say, not very professional of Fisher Price to let this go on for so long and shrug it off by saying the blue paint is non-toxic. The blue ring is a little darker in color than what the picture shows. Having said that, we haven't had any issues with the blue paint coming off. I figured I would try it because it's an inexpensive learning toy. We just washed the rings really thoroughly when we received the order and did not have any issues.  Our daughter loved to pull the rings off and watch us put them back on, then began to learn how to put them on herself. Eventually, it will lead to color matching. It's a fun little learning game that develops fine motor skills and captures her interest. The toy is a staple that should be in every toy box. Even I can remember having one as a kid. As an added bonus, the top red ring has beads inside to further stimulate your baby. It's a rattle and a ring all in one.  The product is sturdy and well-made, besides some people having obvious issues with the blue paint coming off (although I didn't experience this myself). Infants love this, and they can even chew on the plastic. This is a timeless classic that should never go out of style.

Differences between Dominion and Dominion: Seaside:  Duration cards: There are cards in this expansion that last more than one turn. Yes this can get confusing and does make the play more interesting. I found that I really liked this new aspect of the game.  The embargo card: This card allows you to place an embargo token on any stack of cards after which when someone buys one they will be given a curse card. I thought this was an interesting addition to the game but didn't see it get used as much as I would have expected.  Pirates card: this card lets you place coins on a mat. Once you have coins on the mat and the pirate card comes up you can choose to get more coins or to add the value of the coins to your treasure cards. This is a good way to build treasure and buy victory points.  Island victory card: This is an action + victory card that has a mat with it. It allows you to set aside a card onto the mat when you play the Island card they are added back into your deck at the end of the game. I thought this was going to be a much better card than it ended up being.  The Native Village card: This also has a mat that lets you set aside a card or pick up the cards on the mat.

Note they are a little smaller than many play figurines (roughly 2.5 to 3.5 inches tall).  That is not a problem -- indeed, it has some serious benefits (they take up less room, smaller for travel, etc.)  But it is worth being aware of if you are thinking about combining these with characters from other Frozen playsets made by other companies.  I wanted to buy some Disney characters before a trip to Disney World (and then we stay out of the gift shops once there; more time for rides :-)  I bought these after checking out the (vastly more expensive) alternatives.  Indeed, even used on ebay, used Disney characters in passable shape seem to start at about $1.50 each (plus shipping; vs. this for about the same price, without shipping.)  Note that Beverly Hills Teddy Bear Company also has larger sets of Disney characters, so do a search on Amazon for ""Beverly Hills Teddy Bear"" and ""Disney"" to see the full range of options before you buy, since some of the characters in the different sets overlap.  Some of the reviewers said the paint was sloppy on their figures.  Ours were not absolutely perfect, it is true; however, they were pretty impressive for their price point I would never had noticed if the other reviewers hadn't pointed it out.  It was not anything our kids would ever care about.  As collector items, these might be a disappointment.  But, unless the sets substantially differ from the quality of ours (which is always possible), it would be the rare kid who would be unhappy about the quality of the figures we received.  P.S. If your kids really like playing with these types of figurines, buy these, and then do a search for Schleich figurines (fairies, kings, queens, knights pirates, etc.) and Safari LTD figures (which has some of those, along with some stunning wild animal and ranch figures, too).  They are quite a bit more expensive, a bit bigger, and beautifully made (in other words, they are way nicer than these, but they also 4x or more expensive per figure; as such, I view all of them as being worthy of ""5 stars"" given the impressive price-to-play value ratio of each.)  I do believe there is real educational value to having unbranded figures dominating a play figurine mix (i.e. not just ""Frozen"" characters, but also generic ""winter fairies"") as it greatly enhances the range of non-linear play opportunities and unique storylines a child might be inspired to create with their dolls.

I usually buy Grafix, but since it seems that amazon is on backorder. (Says Prime 2 day, but when added to my cart it says arrival July 7th) I decided to try Shrinky Dinks again since I know the product line has been sold to a different company (alexbrands.com). And hoped that maybe the previous issue I had would be worked out.  For one the paper feels much thinner, but it printed what I needed perfectly. Cutting this material is a little weird, since I am used to cutting slightly thicker paper. But this is a pro as the callus on my thumb was thankful for the break.  But baking, when it shrinks it curls really bad. Thankfully I use a plastic stamp block to flatten out my pieces. But once flattened, my images did not shrink the correct way. The images are tall and narrow. I did attempt to bake again at a slightly higher temp to see if maybe that would correct it. Nope just curled again and when I mention curl, it's not a slight curl it's where the top and bottom are almost touching.  I did glaze them with Mod Podge Gloss and everything looks great. But I won't purchase this again. I'll stick with Grafix as their product has always been consistent. In the past I had a problem with the Shrinky Dink paper leaving bubble marks. (This was before they sold the brand to alexbrands.com) The company refused to acknowledge there was a problem and more so something that I was doing wrong. (Despite that I have worked with their product for YEARS and never had a problem.)

Upon getting this New 52 Black Adam figure, my opinion (like elbows and kneecaps) remains the same. Needless to say, I still purchased the figure at my local comic shop. It was not until I got home that I realized how little I liked the figure.  Hindsight it 20/20, but I wish that I had not been in such a rush while at the store so I would have had more time to carefully evaluate the figure to determine whether or not is was worth the purchase or not. My grandmother drove me to the comic shop and was honking her horn relentlessly to hurry up. To make matters worse, I had drunk far too much rootbeer. The store owner doesn't let anyone use the store restroom for one reason or another so I had to wait till I got to the fabric store with my grandmother before I could go. She was in a rush to pick up more fabric for the George Zimmerman Christmas Musical her church group is performing this year at the Parade Children's Academy. As for the sense of design of the character's costume it is difficult to relate to either.

The furniture have the drinks under them. So you mark off on or clue sheet which characters and furniture you have looked under and any times or drinks you have seen under them. You then can make an accusation. Who ate the cake at what time with what drink. The four year old who just turned 4 was able to match up and figure out what to mark off on her clue sheet. She just needed a little help with the accusations. The 6 year old even understands the concept well. A few more times of playing this and I think she will be a pro.

1845,387646,5,2.0,True,"03 20, 2011",A24WSD48Z3WUZS,B002IVFOC8,,G Wheels,"My first mSR was an experience in frustration. It flew erratically, hovered poorly and darted backwards at incredible speed. Trimming it out was impossible even though the dual rate was set at beginner; anyone in the room with it was at risk. The mSR made a screeching growl as it flew and needed full forward trim with the forward control pressed to its limit in order to launch. The reviews and my experience didn't match up so after a few weeks of trying to get used to the controls it was returned. The replacement was very different. It hovered right out of the box, requiring very little trimming. Considering its feather weight it moved around with good control. It is much quieter than its replacement and can be landed consistently on a snack tray. I can now give a good review on this popular single rotor micro.  I have several coaxial toy helicopters and as reported, is quite different other than the basics. Coaxials are so stable in comparison that learning to fly the micro Blade is a bit like starting over. Simply put, imagine a pingpong ball atop a wave. The mSR is so light that it follows its own turbulence. Take your hands from the controls and if there are no objects in the radius of the washing effect the mSR will settle into a reasonably stationary hover. When maneuvering, sliding left/right or backwards produces very quick movement, even in the low rate setting. Forward locomotion is very similar to the coaxial counterpart if not slower. In other words, the mSR in the low rate is still quite quick and nimble and if not prepared, will get into trouble in all directions but forward. What is perhaps the least desirable aspect of the mSR is the way it launches. Unlike a coaxial, it will not rise straight up. Invariably, it moves a distance left or right. My guess is that it again is being buffeted by its own turbulence. The heavier coaxials with counter rotating blades that act as stabilizing gyros and the overall weight produces mass to overcome this. Perhaps that is the reason the demos show the mSR being launched by hand. You need to forget how easy the coaxial helicopters are to fly and resolve to deal with a new learning curve if you are to enjoy this little humming bird.  I have experienced the beginnings of coordinating a sideways slide with a turn to produce a nose down pitch and turn pirouette style maneuver. This is completely different from any coaxial capability and of course very rewarding and addictive. This I suppose is the definition of the 3D maneuvering capabilities and what draws someone into the more expensive 3 dimensional helicopters. At any rate, this is what has happened to me. My five star rating ignores the relative crudeness and focuses on the value and gratitude to E-flite for offering such an affordable, effective and durable product for the transition. The mSR endures crashes simply because it weighs next to nothing. It is like crashing a feather. Had I rated the mSR on my first experience it would be one or at best two stars. I was unlucky to have gotten a faulty first unit. Now I'm a die hard fan. The simple MLP4DSM control is an excellent value and can be used on their other Bind N Fly helicopters. My eye is now on the 120 SR; a heavier / larger helicopter that can be flown inside and out and has all the same function of its little sibling.  The fit and form of the mSR isn't impressive because it is all business and ignores the coaxial bling race. It has one blue LED to let you know it is active. The canopy is at minimal thickness held on with friction fasteners all made for lightness. Removing and installing the battery each time you fly isn't convenient but once again is simple practicality. The overriding aspect is that every part for the mSR can be purchased, even the screws. It has a large stable following and is THE step one can affordably take from the toy helicopter society into the 3D RC helicopter hobby. It departs radically from the stable flight characteristics of the coaxial (other than hovering) but supplants that change with very rewarding maneuvering capabilities. It is only natural to initially fly the mSR like a coaxial. The result is to complain about the inherent instability during maneuvers but once the controls become extensions of your nervous system, the bird flies from brain waves.

My kids are going into first grade and fifth grade, and both really enjoy this game. There is some strategy in paying attention to who switches which monkeys and in choosing what to do after you roll.  My first grader needs a little help with the math at the end as it's often just a little bit too much for him.  I love that they can play it together and it stretches their math skills and I always love games that come with a ""solo play"" option. My first grader can do that as long as he has his calculator, so that's great.  The two reasons I gave it 3 stars are:  1. The monkey balance on a rectangular base that is NOT stable enough.  If you play on the carpet, they will constantly fall over.  If you play on a table, they will fall over when anyone bumps the table.  We have found the only way we can play is on a hard floor (which we only have in the kitchen) or on the floor with everyone having something hard to put their monkeys on and they STILL fall over pretty regularly.  We've had to quit a couple games because we've all seen all the monkeys that aren't flipped, ruining the game.  It would be easily a 5-star game if the monkeys had a larger, maybe round base so they could stand better.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is to have them all fall over every other turn or so.  One game ended in tears with both kids accusing the other of purposely knocking down their monkeys.  2.  The ""reverse"" option on the die is pretty useless overall. Most times we are playing solo or two people, and it just amounts to a skipped turn.  I'd rather have another ""steal"" or maybe ""give away"" one or something?  3. The directions are a little confusing at first.  We had to play while reading them, but we ""got it"" pretty quickly.  After the first full game, we didn't need to refer to the directions anymore. This is pretty minor, really, and I wouldn't have knocked it down just for this.  4. For some reason, the monkeys that are 0 points have an X instead of 0.  I don't know why, this just seems weird. Again, that alone wouldn't have cost it a star, that's just a note.  Overall, this is a fun game that I don't mind playing and doesn't go on forever like Candy Land.  It has some educational value and the kids can play it without me. I did receive this game at a discount for my honest opinion, which I've given.

My three kids really enjoyed play with this set - twice. However, I have to admit it was really, really hard to clean. The Play Doh gets stuck in just the wrong places and you end up needing to be quite creative to get it all out before it hardens. The colors that come with the set are perfect for making tough construction looking bricks and such, but once you run out of those - purple and blue bricks just don't feel right. So, you will probably have to keep those earth tone colors on hand or encourage the kids to pretend they are building on Pluto or Neptune and they ""in fact"" have purpose soil (maybe).

For cognitive play, I ask my 2 year old daughter to find specific bugs or bugs that fly or bugs of a particular color. Since there is no picture to indicate which bug goes in what slot, a negative in some reviews, she has to find it based on memory and form, which she seems to enjoy doing. However, in actual execution there are some negatives.  The first and most important is the safety issue. The back of the ""bugs"" in my game has a thin layer of wood product that is peeling off (I just got the game yesterday). This creates pieces of wood ""splinters"" that are unsafe. I imagine this could be fixed by gluing the backs but I shouldn't have to do this.  Second, the length of the magnetic cord is not optimal for small toddlers as they can hit themselves in the face and it makes it harder to manipulate the ""net."" This can be remedied by taking up the cord length and tying a knot to shorten it. I suggest taking the whole cord out and reversing the knot to the backside, since tying a knot in front creates a length of cord in the field of view. For my daughter, this was a distraction.  I did notice that the graphics were glued-on paper, not painted, but I have yet to see this curl up as other reviewers have noted in the short time I have owned the toy.  In summary, good concept but quality is lacking.

2122,993597,4,,False,"10 12, 2014",A19WEEGB05YAZ3,B00ILA28H4,,J. Weaver,"This 3-pack includes modern updates of three of the five 1986 Protectobots from the original Transformers toys (the three who haven't been previously updated in the various incarnations of the Transformers Classics line since it began in 2006), using molds from the Transformers toyline based on the recent Prime TV cartoon. As can be expected with such a set, the quality of the figures varies within the set. I approached the figures as an adult collector who's been a fan of the Transformers for their entire  30-year history, along with two much younger fans, my 8-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son. Unfortunately, my 3-year-old was only able to transform one of the three (Groove) after several tries, and my daughter mastered Groove easily but lost interest in trying to transform First Aid and went back to wondering aloud why Groove looks so much like the version of Arcee from Prime (of which she's a much bigger fan than I am). They did both enjoy playing with them in robot and vehicle modes, however.  First Aid is the strongest of the three in terms of the figure itself. He's a repaint of a Prime Ratchet figure from 2012, with no alterations I can identify other than a slightly different color scheme. Robot mode is quite posable, with ambulance mode concealing all identifiable robot parts (hands, head, etc), and a clean, intuitive transformation scheme. He's very close to perfect, with one caveat: he simply doesn't look like First Aid. The head is unmistakably Ratchet (aside from the Michael Bay films, Ratchet has a pretty distinctive head design that repeats in various versions of the franchise), while First Aid had a blocky head. It's a bit strange that Hasbro often repurposes existing molds for new characters and updates, changing the heads or other minor physical details, but left what is definitely a Ratchet head on First Aid. Also, this version of Ratchet apparently used swords, which are repeated here--a little strange for First Aid's character. And, aside from the ""is this First Aid or Ratchet?"" aspect, these swords are soft rubber, which is the figure's only weakness.  Streetwise (here called ""Streetsmart"" because Hasbro didn't trademark a lot of these names in the 80s and has lost the rights to some names over the years) is here represented by a Prime figure of Prowl, which was in turn a modification of an earlier Prime Smokescreen figure. As a figure, he's almost as good as First Aid. His transformation is more complicated than First Aid's (and is one of those cases where you're actually better off looking at photos of police car and robot mode and simply fiddling around with him than by trying to follow the instructions). He's also an excellent, fully-articulated robot, though one step (his ""wings"") don't seem to want to snap into place quite right. Car mode is passable, but there's some difficulty snapping some of the various parts into place (the fenders weren't even snapped into place properly in the packaging), so it's not quite perfect. His weapon is a plain-looking handheld rocket launcher, but at least it's solid plastic. And, though Prowl's head doesn't look exactly like the classic Streetwise head, it's a far lessing jarring difference than between Ratchet and First Aid, and he's the figure in the set who looks the most like the classic version.  Groove, well, Groove is the weak link in more ways than one. He's a reissue of a Prime Arcee figure from a more ""budget"" line, so the figure is far less complex than his brothers. As far as I can tell, the only difference between the Arcee figure and Groove reissue is the color of the Autobot badge and the color of his guns (well, gun in Arcee's case; Groove includes two where Arcee only included one). Transformation is simple, and the figure is surprisingly good in both robot and motorcycle mode; he's just not in the same class as First Aid and Streetwise. He just looks absolutely nothing like Groove--the mold is, necessarily, feminine (what with Arcee being a female and all), the two characters aren't even close to the same type of motorcycle, and the dark blue color is just wrong. I'm not sure if someone at Hasbro decided to leave him in Arcee's original color scheme to contrast him with two white vehicles in the same set, or what. Luckily, the mold is so small that the face isn't definitively a female face, and they were considerate enough to give him two guns like the original (also in soft rubber, like First Aid's blades). One plus, though, is that, in vehicle mode, this is the first time that I know of where Groove is more or less properly scaled to the other Protectobots.  The packaging itself is rather striking, taking its basic design from the unrelated Age of Extinction toy packaging. (The instructions also include the ""Transformers 4"" logo for some reason.) I suspect the images of the three characters was repurposed from earlier packaging with minimal alteration; Groove in particular has a more masculine face than Arcee had in the Prime cartoon, but the image shows him armed with two blades from an altogether different Arcee figure. The figures and their weapons are attached with paper twist-ties, which are far easier to deal with than the plastic ties used on many earlier Transformers packages.  The remaining two Protectobots, Blades and Hot Spot, were previously updated (Blades in 2008 as a repaint of a character named Evac from the Cybertron cartoon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Universe-Voyager-Class-Autobot-Blades/dp/B00172XSHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Universe Voyager Class - Autobot Blades</a>, and Hot Spot as a Toys R Us exclusive repaint of Classics Inferno in 2012,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Generations-GDO-Voyager-Class-Protectobot-Hot-Spot/dp/B009NVUZU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Generations GDO Voyager Class Protectobot Hot Spot</a>). So, if you have these previous figures (or are willing to pay for them on the secondary market), you can complete your Protectobot team with this set. (Just don't try to combine them into Defensor, because first, they are all based on figures that don't combine, and, second, if you were somehow able to get past the first problem, he would have a ridiculously short right leg since this Groove is so small relative to the other four.) However, a more economical option for completing the team would be the companion to this set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Asia-Kids-Day-Protectobots-Evac-Squad-2-Pack/dp/B00ILA28MO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Asia Kids Day Protectobots Evac Squad 2-Pack</a>. I'd have to recommend trying to track down good prices on the earlier figures, though, as the two-pack uses the Grapple re-tool of the Inferno sculpt, making Hot Spot a crane for some reason (and ditching the light blue for red and yellow), as well as a sculpt from a guy named Blazemaster from the Revenge of the Fallen line for Blades, and the movie-based figures use a completely different aesthetic than any other incarnation.  Based on the current retail price for the ""Deluxe"" scale figures (honestly, if you're not a Transformers collector, don't even try to make sense out of the weird names Hasbro has come up with for different sizes of figures or your head will explode), this set is actually a good deal, since you're essentially paying for two Deluxe-scale figures and getting a free Cyberverse/Legends-scale figure. And, unless Hasbro decides to make new updates of the Protectobots, this is the only way to get updated versions of Groove, Streetwise, and First Aid, even if they're not 100% accurate. Just be aware, if you're considering these for a child, the transformation for two of the three may be a bit difficult for even those 6 and up. (Luckily, as is usually the case with Transformers in the last decade or so, most parts that previously would've broken off if transformed incorrectly merely pop off and can be easily reattached.)","Maybe not the best updates for the Protectobots, but very good figures",1413072000,,"collector repurposed alteration update fully-articulated decade gdo consider who's considerate toy mold market cartoon,&nbsp;<a figure actually image try scale strike last crane follow weapon get franchise many streetsmart sure plain-looking make different mode set,&nbsp;<a turn tell original logo right would've try recent far easy type child big version bite step generation almost version repeat complicate difficulty would unmistakably vehicle young leave include easily tv explode difficult show head plus companion film break sizes protectobots set repeat two reissue call previously police they're may arcee lessing relative small guy give case know transform plastic female blazemaster names much aid's arm character luckily enjoy rubber like repurposes adult way economical come four character take usually caveat here--a sword nothing modern several dark photo within definitely gun problem color master fall well unfortunately tie ambulance streetwise surprisingly minor approach one identifiable new term option snap vehicle deluxe-scale strange exist instruction bay first accurate revenge time launcher various masculine history package spot</a protectobot etc also autobot pay link rocket weak physical five year snap universe case play update since distinctive classic though son incarnation figure wing merely there's basic ditch use right incorrectly deluxe three exactly extinction he's rather transform second motorcycle spot weird use head price name red however recommend yellow decides groove--the scale simply interest hot least aspect prowl's ridiculously enough i'd ratchet michael slightly contrast hand groove jar fan weakness wonder go intuitive le leave altogether little blades</a daughter face entire lot definitively image defensor quality back aside deal place try wrong sense aloud able free good inferno use smokescreen design team re-tool honestly conceal particular part white paper begin fender close unrelated somehow classic squad class=""a-link-normal aware posable kid movie-based willing make car i'm often trademark along represent attach previous look varies secondary sculpt well expect difference transformer look change unless cybertron look age track pop apparently incarnation alteration quite package complex aesthetic way pay properly someone repaint perfect figure's two-pack completely passable soft mode brother weapon solid simple budget clean prowl earlier line remain evac include cyberverse/legends-scale transformation asia complete snap feminine reason blocky lose necessarily exclusive gun prime price arcee's fiddle want suspect cartoon light aid decide blue fan complete even data-hook=""product-link-linked reattached mold twist-ties day toyline identify modification hasbro current voyager grapple class short badge around combine blade include excellent seem leg scheme handheld retail detail essentially past base get robot strong toy minimal us absolutely pretty"

Whatever you like to describe it, it works, its been working for thirty years. With two sequels, an animated film and hundreds of references in the main DC Comics Universe, DC Films, in particular DC's newest Extended Film Universe with Dawn of Justice.  This action figure comes from the epic finale where Batman is forced to fight Superman in a battle to the death and the honor to defend the right to fight. The figure looks awesome, it practically jumps from the pages of Lynn Varley's artwork, down to that mean scowl. Standing at a 7 inches, its believable to think that this belongs with the Mattel DC Universe Classics/DC Comics Multiverse action figure lineup. The detail is great, with magnificent detail on the armor. The figure is all solid plastic, with softer areas under the boots, the torso chest piece and the flowing cape. The articulation is also pretty cool, but there is no ab crunch. Still the arms, legs and head can move nicely.  The figure has only one accessory, the sonic pistol that he used against Superman.

This involves having a farmer grow different types of bamboo on their associated, watered fields and moving the panda around to eat it.  While light and silly, the theme is fun and beautifully integrated in every aspect of the game.  The components are of excellent quality, from the sturdy interlocking bamboo pieces to the decently thick cardboard land tiles to the miniature panda and farmer figurines.  Players build a single garden (board) and move a sole farmer and panda around it while trying to complete hidden goals dictated by drawn cards.  As such your actions influence your opponents directly and will often aid them in completing goals, adding depth to gameplay choices.  When one player achieves a set target number of goals everyone else gets a final turn and then victory points for completed goals are totaled to determine the winner.  There are three types of goal cards (players start with one of each): 1) Panda goals - claim a certain color/number of bamboo by having the panda eat it. 2) Plots goals - redeem when the shown configuration of colored land is on the game board and irrigated. 3) Gardener goals - grow pictured color(s) of bamboo to shown height.  On each turn a player will choose two of the following actions: 1) Draw three garden plots and choose one to add to the board. 2) Move the panda and eat bamboo if possible. 3) Move the gardener and grow bamboo if possible. 4) Lay piping to irrigate plots. 5) Draw a goal card.  Goals can be redeemed any time on your turn and do not require an action.  There are some further rules, but that's the gist.  The game is quick to teach and plays relatively quickly.  There is a fair amount of luck involved, so while your choices do matter don't enter looking for pure strategy.  The biggest criticism of the game (from my own group and other reviewers) is balance.  The panda cards appear too easy to complete in comparison to the other goals and points awarded, so there is a tendency for players to concentrate on drawing only those.  I don't think it's game breaking though, and people who drew a variety won just as often in the games I've played (timely use of tokens that prevent a certain tile from having its bamboo eaten can help to derail opponents using that strategy).  Overall Takenoko is a high quality, enjoyable game to have on hand for casual or younger players or for breaks from the more complex stuff.  It's not going to blow away veteran gamers, but I still found it plenty worthwhile.",Fantastic light strategy game.,1360368000,,player color(s criticism stuff away move directly card reviewer play gardener prevent hand amount i've decently action tendency use complex type teach theme cardboard player focus add bamboo think action takenoko timely garden redeem everyone eaten rule group enjoyable aspect opponent claim luck point high sturdy color/number configuration blow different veteran token tile involve found play eat fun thick enter strategy concentrate irrigate grow silly draw involves that's one depth break show balance pure turn quality total complete panda possible gamers relatively determine try go associate single quick add farmer quickly figurine card irrigate target goal number influence light complete certain variety game dictate aid miniature draw color pictured time draw component help care sole drawn tile fair award game plot choice complete bear still casual young start plenty field giant matter easy else lay derail water winner big hidden choose require height build appear around set move two overall often integrated break gameplay excellent though pip board comparison redeem people worthwhile use gist goal victory achieve interlock get three final piece every land look beautifully follow

2347,690710,5,4.0,True,"02 21, 2013",A2QFTJAT1D5PIL,B00A7QEIBO,,S. F.,"When Hasbro first came out with the Transformers Kre-O sets, I was both excited and a little hesitant, because I figured it would be hard to make a Lego robot that would actually ""Transform"".  In theory, it's great.  In practice...well, having to take apart and re-assemble a figure in order to get it into vehicle mode kind of takes the fun away a little.  So I wasn't a big fan.  I DID really like the little mini Kreon figures though, but didn't think it was worth paying full price for a whole set when all I would want would be the Kreon, which did't even transform. Flash forward to present day, and we now have the Kre-O Micro-Changers, which, even though not perfect (you are left with some extra parts when you go from Robot to Vehicle mode and vice versa), is definitely an improvement over the initial offerings.  Having Combiners was just the next logical step. The first release Micro-Changers Combiners consist of Devastator, Superion, Bruticus and Predaking, and all four sets are made up of four Micro-Changer figures.  Even though I think Bruticus looks the best out of the four, Devastator will always hold a special place in my heart, since he was the first in the old school series, and he was also the only combiner set I had as a kid.  If you are familiar with the character, you know that there are actually six Constructicons that combine to form Devastator, so your set is missing Long Haul and Hook (I was lucky enough to find an individual Hook). Each mini figure is in a separate bag, so when you initially put them together, you don't have to go searching for which piece goes with what mini figure.  The instructions are your basic Lego type instructions, with detailed pictures showing you how to assemble the figures into their robot mode, their vehicle mode, and finally, how to combine all four into the Mighty Devastator (well, in actuality, your basic 4 inch GI Joe figure could probably beat him up). If you are familiar with Kre-O figures, you know that there are some slight QC issues when you compare them to Legos.  Wrists have stress marks where they are attached to hands, some blocks don't fit quite as tight as they should while other are a little too tight and other minor issues like that, but that's really being nitpicky. All in all, the four mini figures look pretty good.  Good old school florencent green and purple coloring really reminds you of the original Constructicons.  And they all transform in a very simplified go-bot style.  For the most part, you just lay them flat on their faces (or in one case, his back), add a few items, and you have a vehicle.  Actually kind of cool. The combination gets a little tricky, since you have to take two of the four figures totally apart in order to form the upper half of Devastator (the body portions of those figures actually forms the torso and the legs end up being the arms).  The legs are basically two figures sans their heads.  When you do get him formed, he has pretty good articulation, and even though he's tiny, he actually looks pretty good. If you're really not into the skinny arms and legs, the beauty of it is that they are building blocks.  You can add to them if you have other Kre-O sets, or even if you have Lego sets, so you can use your imagination and add to him till you come up with a creation that suites you. As far the age listing on the box, Ages 6-12 seems kind of high for something like this.  I can totally understand the need for a higher age bracket for some of the other sets, which have thousands of pieces, but for a 76 piece set, I'm figuring a 4 year old, with some help from mom & dad (or an uncle who likes spoiling them) would have a field day with him.

Depending on placement of the card (I noticed it was harder for me to spot an animal if I was looking at it upside down, from across the table), and how small the animal is (the cards will have a match but the animal is usually smaller on one and larger on the other), it can lead to several players being stumped.  I was on the fence about whether to get Spot it Original or Spot it Jr. My 4 year old had a harder time than the 5 year old finding the matches, but still did fine. I think around 4-5 is a great age to introduce this game. I understand Spot it Jr is all animals so as to make it easier for the children to identify. However because of the cartoonish drawings, I found my 4 year old was usually at a loss for words as to what the animals were. She would just point to the matches. The 5 year old had no trouble.  Like I said before, even us moms were sometimes stumped as to the matches for a few seconds. So I think this is a great game for all ages. I'm also looking forward to getting the original game.

My daughters had a similar ninja-type tournament set a few years ago, and after it broke they said that they wanted another one.  Enter this playset which offers a lot more bang and options.

There are multiple launch points, including these very nifty zip lines that make me wish something like this had been available when I was a kid.  (Maybe they need to make a He-Man warrior for this set to appeal to the '80s generation.)  There's no strategy or secrets, at least as far as I know.  We have not discovered any tips that give one side an edge over another, so you basically just watch and root for your team.  And the last one is the winner, plain and simple.  Because the rounds are short and there's competition involved, my kids will play with this for hours it seems.  Because when one wins, the other insists on another try, and so it goes on and on and on.  So there is definitely re-playability here, even if there's not a lot of room for creativity.

Her hair is plastic and it shows each strand, and she even has her little firefly barrette. She has freckles under her eyes and you can change her eye position if you take her face off.   I couldn't manage to get her face off, and I didn't want to force it off because I was afraid I would break her neck. Her nose is sort of pointy, so the paint on it can rub off easily. Her hands and feet can pop on and off, which makes it easier to twist the hand around and change its positioning.   Her arms and legs are made out of iron thread, which makes her bendable. However, if you bend her too much they could snap off. She also has little holes on her back side where common joints would be (elbows and knees), which make it safer and easier to bend. Her facial expression is different from the picture shown, though I like the dolls expression much more than the one in the picture.   Over all, I think this is a great doll and I really like her. I recommend her for ages 10 and older, because she is sort of fragile.

Some cards have a special ability such as protecting you from any other players' actions for a whole turn or allowing you to guess what card another player has and if correct they discard it.  The goal being that a player is out once they have no hand (ex: someone uses the aforementioned card and guesses their hand correctly, forcing them to discard) and last player standing wins.

The door has a shape matching set of holes with a pocket for the shapes to fall into.  The opposite side has a hole for balls to enter and slide down plastic ramps into a pocket.  The steering wheel turns, and the spinner on the back spins well.  It's a good toy for a youngster who is not quite walking yet but loves to grab at different items and manipulate them.  The wheels also spin, but do not touch the ground.  This is not a rolling car and is meant to stay in one place.  Given that there is no bottom to the car however, my children have found it entertaining to sit in the car and half carry, half shove the whole thing around our apartment.  For children older than two, this car isn't going to entertain them for very long, and larger children will find the car a tight squeeze (my 4 year old just barely can fit his long legs inside).  I'd say it's a toy meant for a very specific age bracket.  Add to that the fact that this is a very big toy.  It takes up quite a large amount of space about the size of a rectangular milk crate.  This makes it impractical for small apartment spaces where floor space is at a premium.  It cannot be folded up or deconstructed to store somewhere, so the question of what to do with it and where to put it is high on the list.  I did think it would turn out to be more flimsy than it's proven to be.  Both of my kids have played on it for several weeks with no damage or pieces breaking off.  They're both losing interest in it now, and mostly try to see how many toys they can stuff inside the sitting space, but it's a nice item for a youngster who is sitting up well and loves cars, but hasn't quite mastered walking yet.

It contains almost the same active chemicals as the other, but I liked the foaming from the Sumo. I give it a five star because it is a good glue for gaps and dries fast.

2529,1774056,5,,True,"11 14, 2016",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00U7A8D16,,Christopher Barrett,"This is just a striking HG Gundam. It has a lot of awesomely jarring colors: light blue, blue-gray, pink sparkle, red... But it looks pretty neat.  I haven't had any issues with parts falling off other than the Gundam crest when losing the head, which happens with several HG Gundams.  Even my wife admits this is a pretty sweet Gundam. And that's the best recommendation of all.  So technical stuff: I would NOT recommend this as a first or second Gunpla.  This is a complicated build for an HG, as most of the build fighters are.  It really bridges the gap between HG and RG.  No skeletal frame and fewer stickers than RG kits but with more pieces and runners than an average HG kit.  This kit in particular has a lot of fun accessories.  You have a few different set up styles with this kit.  I enjoy the wing setup, but there is a burning setup and a punch or kick action setup as well.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND getting a ""Bandai Hobby HGBC 000 Build Custom GP Base"".  Basically the custom base kits for Build Fighter gundams.  A standard 1/144 base will NOT fit well.  It sticks out too much front and back and will hit the waist skirt, causing the back waist skirt to stick up slightly.  The movement on this Gundam is very good for an HG.  Legs can be raised very high for some cool kicking action. The legs and arms are very secure, as is the waist area.  It doesn't come apart easily.  The only couple of touchy areas are the head crest (always - EVERY Gundam from HG to SG to MG has that dang Gundam crest that just loves to come off when adjusting the head! Grrrr... lol).  The wings, wrist swords, burn effects, and pony tails all stay affixed nicely.  They are made from a very soft, flexible plastic which is very easy to work with.  One area that was a pain: the two large leg pieces that fit together with the rectangular PC piece (soft rubberized plastic) with the rectangular hole in the middle are really fussy.  I recommend shaving the pieces (from the PC runner) on the round ends slightly (making it more cone shaped and less cylindrical) so they fit better into the plastic leg molds.  If you try and push them in, the round piece squishes and won't take one or the other side.  Then when you put the ankle or upper leg piece in, it causes the leg piece to try and separate.  You'll know the step when you get there.  I'll notate the exact pieces in this review asap.  I also recommend against using some of the stickers for the leg and shoulder pieces.  Those areas look better with panel lining in my opinion.  The white stickers do look nice though, so use those.  And speaking of panel lining... I used gray for the light blue/gray pieces, and it looks... alright (see photos), but I would probably use black if I did this again.  The gray works great for the white pieces and light pink pieces.  SO right now this is my favorite HG of all (that I have assembled).  All of the colors pop nicely and look great with sanding.  I didn't even top coat it and it is still stunning.  I have a few other HG models to assemble and then I will give an update ranking.  I have the Norn Banshee, Astray Amatu and Fenice Reascita... so we'll see...  Build time: 5 hours with sanding and panel lining. Difficulty: 3 out of 5 (5 out of 5 compared to other HG models). Build fun: 5 out of 5 (super fun!) Mobility: 3 out of 5 (4 out of 5 compared to other HG models). Accessories: 5 out of 5 (so many style options!) Value: 5 out of 5 ($20 on Amazon with Prime shipping) Overall appearance: 5 out of 5  This is one super slick HG Gundam.

Since there are lots of reviews about this game in general, I'll write mine in comparison to the original ""America"" one.  ""Ticket to Ride: Europe"" is a stand-alone, full board game made of the same quality and durability as the original. The train pieces are plastic, the point markers are wood, and the board is heavy-duty and the same dimensions as the America one. The biggest improvement over the America version is that the train and ticket cards are all full-size instead of mini half-size of the original America version, so you don't need to buy an expansion simply to get larger, easier-to-handle cards.  In many ways, ""Europe"" feels much more balanced than the America version, with more double paths and more tracks in general to get to different cities, where in the America version you could get blocked much easier. Also in the Europe version, the long 20-point routes are separated at the start and each player is randomly dealt 1 along with 3 other short/normal sized routes to choose from. This ensures that every player has the chance to complete a large cross-continent route, which was often the winning strategy of the America board - but only if you happened to of had a long route dealt to you at the start. The inclusion of the new station markers allows you to utilize one of your opponents route segments so you can finish a ticket without building parts of the route. This is really useful in crowded areas of the board where you are unable to build a route.  However, don't let these things fool you - there are other elements that increase the difficulty (and entertainment) of ""Ticket to Ride: Europe"".  There are a few routes that are MUCH longer than any routes in the America version that take much more effort to complete. ""Ferries"" and ""tunnels"" make even short routes trickier to build:  ferries require you to use a certain amount of rainbow locomotive cards to complete while tunnels may require extra cards from your hand depending on a random draw from the deck. These elements can keep even the best strategist in check and allow less experienced players to have a chance at winning.  I personally also enjoy that the cities on the board are given their historical local names rather than their Americanized names, so the game acts as a bit of a geography lesson for those unfamiliar with Europe.  I'm still a fan of the original America version; it has its own quirks and balance so I can't say I prefer one over the other. If you enjoy the Ticket to Ride series and would like to buy some of the expansion boards (like the ""Asia"" or ""Africa"" boards) but don't own either base set, I might recommend the Europe game over the America one just because of the full-size train and ticket cards.",Must-have for any board gamer,1407715200,,player deal local plastic rainbow card names much i'll chance durability base effort hand use amount act double long marker enjoy europe like ensures however extra tunnel depend heavy-duty board recommend way prefer player could simply lesson americanized need america might useful ride sized segment lot can't get opponent easier-to-handle favorite many allow station experience stand-alone expansion happen build take short/normal feel element different locomotive mine train randomly long cross-continent balance less africa strategy write finish thing really draw one ferry personally balance series asia new unfamiliar quality city separate original increase make historical full-size improvement point utilize let large easy large random quirk inclusion fool trickier geography bit game full route certain version half-size difficulty would strategist blocked deck entertainment part check buy track win general game also fan area complete still path even mini start ticket wood route crowd big make choose either require short unable build review i'm since best set often along instead without board comparison allows say dimension piece every may give keep rather

The packaging is awesome, first time I have seen professional, shelf quality packaging for a custom accessories pack. It's well designed to show exactly what you are getting, and is just superb looking, front and back.  Each set is geared to dress up a single figure, but there are extra parts so you can customize and change out your minifigure's supplies. And then, any left overs can go towards another figure!  The parts are all modular and interact with each other. With the use of some pegs, you can rearrange where each item sits on the figure, or even use it on other things. I personally have found that I LOVE putting the backpacks and such on vehicles to add a bit of a well supplied look to them. the backpacks fit onto a hollow stud, so there are plenty of places to put them.  And at $6.99, I think they are great deals. Each one has quite a few custom parts in it, and many of them have screen printing. The printing is clear, crisp, and as far as I can tell, accurate to it's source material.  All the parts are molded very well, with just enough detail to be cool, but not enough to look out of place on a LEGO figure. And the resemblance to real world items is very well done.  This pack is probably my favorite out of series 1. The Mask is such a cool piece, it just snaps onto the minifigure's head, and the helmet fits very well over top of it. 3 out of 8 pieces in this pack have printing, the helmet has the black shield with a silver eagle over it (Which looks very nice), there is an olive green field cap with a silver eagle and rank pip for when your soldier needs to take a break from hauling the heavy gear around, and the gas-mask has silver rims printed around the goggles. The kit includes field suspenders, two headgear options, a fuel tank as a backpack, a canister commonly used by German troops of the era, a two piece gas-mask, and the Flammenwerfer 41!  The flamethrower has a hollow end so you can add a flame piece to it for more play-ability and display options. The figure can hold it two handed, but it won't leave room for the canister to go on the front of the suspenders. All in all, it's a fantastic kit, as once it's all on a minifigure it looks quite menacing.",This is a Flammenwerfer.

Rainman,"So, first of all, I have to say that I'm old enough to remember when trading cards were something you got at 7-11 for a dime a pack, and you got some really hard bubble gum with them.  I can remember blowing a dollar (4 week's allowance) on ten packs of cards, looking for that elusive Roger Staubach card, and tearing each pack open with high expectations, only to get a bunch of stuff I already had.  So believe me, I know what it means to get a random bundle of trading cards.  It appears that there are about 20 companies selling these sets through Amazon, and I'm guessing from the reviews that some are better than others.  My experience was with 320G.  So, let me first comment on some other reviews.  To many of you, all I can say is:""RTFD"", or, Read the Freaking Description, to put it politely.  It CLEARLY says that you will get cards from Beta to Morradin Beseiged, and if you're up on things like that, it means the odds are against you receiving any Standard Format-legal cards.  It says mint or near mint condition, so obiously worn or damaged cards should be returned.  It also says no commons, foreign cards, or foils, so if you did get some of these, I hope you complained to the seller.  It doesn't say no duplicates, it doesn't advertise a mix of colors or that any of the cards will be useful to you.  There is also no promise that the value of the individual cards will excede the selling price (although at $0.10 a card, I think you get a good value no matter what).  You get what you get and you don't get upset.  Again, though, if you got a large number of duplicates, especially those of you who got octuplets or septuplets, I would complain to the seller.  There is no obligation, but any reputable business wants its customers to be satisfied.  So, I got 99 cards, no more than 2 of any one card, and only 6 sets of dupes.  All were mint or near mint condition.  The kicker on mine was only ONE rare card in the whole set.  So, to keep to my own standards, no one promised 10% rares.  Still, I think that's a little outside the range of acceptable.  So, I will be contacting the seller to see what he will do to make that right.  Even so, I think this is a pretty good deal  and will probably do it again.","Not Great, but not bad either",1376697600,,"know dime hard blowing card clearly foreign is:""rtfd politely like sell obligation advertise appear value beseiged upset near seller useful think roger others open beta receive bubble get want high many septuplets enough company something already description mean color mine good although range read obiously kicker contact put hope little thing really set that's one rare damage business return week's staubach elusive freaking complain deal right complain excede whole pack let pack believe bundle good duplicate guess large worn random probably morradin outside dupe gum card first amazon price stuff number ten remember condition get especially octuplets would rares format-legal comment standard odds also promise reputable satisfied promise still standard see even matter trading mix make experience say review allowance i'm set mint old tearing though customer common bunch foil acceptable individual say dollar look keep expectation pretty"

But since we started having kids (our oldest is 2+), we haven't had either the brain power or the time to set it up and play it. We recently got All Creatures Big and Small, and we've played it more in the first few weeks of owning it than any other game. Immediately after playing it for the first time, I ordered this expansion because...  ...The core game of ACB&S suffers slightly from having NO randomness at all, and being short enough that you can *almost* plan out the entire game (kind of like chess). Even during the first play, I could feel the ""we will always do the following"" thoughts developing in the back of my mind. And after only a few plays, we did fall into an ""opening move"" rhythm that reminds me of chess. This expansion adds some much needed randomness in the setup (one of my favorite aspects of Keyflower, 5 Tribes, and Castles of Burgundy, as well as the original Agricola when playing with minor improvements & occupations).  We've found that the expansion buildings fulfill the ""setup randomness"" to keep the game fresh for us. The random buildings give new and different directions (although they sometimes provoke ""shiny object syndrome""), and they push us to play in different ways- all without leading to Analysis Paralysis! I highly recommend it for anyone who already has ACB&S, since it greatly increases replayability without significantly changing the actual game play.  We've found this game also works well as a ""couples"" game for when we get together with some (married) friends who like to play, but who also don't feel up to playing the full-power Agricola.",Agricola-lite gets even better!,1431388800,,fall give fulfill significantly power move played much week occupation like immediately thought creature order recommend way acb&s could start replayability core lead keyflower provoke get we've favorite anyone enough expansion open object big randomness paralysis slightly already different feel couple wife although find play friends tribes minor suffers one play push love entire new need back castle brain original setup increase kind random together first game almost remind add time highly mind owning get rhythm actual marry sometimes syndrome game also work even plan aspect year recently building kid fresh develop either short playing since set full-power agricola old without chess direction greatly well analysis always burgundy change keep improvement small shiny follow

2985,1176847,4,2.0,True,"01 13, 2016",A2S8I27B6NEU7G,B00OHG1HPU,,Lady T,"I purchased this starter kit for my 8 year old daughter as a Christmas gift, since it was on her wish list. I had watched several toy review videos and was already expecting to have issues with the pen jamming, so I let my daughter know this beforehand. I will admit to being pretty skeptical about this toy after reading some of the reviews and watching the review videos, but my daughter loves crafting so I caved and made the purchase.  She was prepared for the pen tool to jam, but tried it anyway. She was actually able to figure out a way to easily un-jam the pen tool with this little tap/shake motion. It worked like a charm, so she still insists on using the pen tool. I do wish that there were enough pods for all of the colors, but for now we just keep the extra beados in small zipper bags for safekeeping.  I will add that my daughter is a bit of a do it yourself-er and she insisted on creating things on her own (outside of the templates) and she became frustrated when the things she created freehand did not set or hold once sprayed with water and allowed to dry. Most of this due to the fact that she did not understand the concept of the need for the beads to touch other surrounding beads for support. When using the templates and the bead tray there is a bit more success with having it stick together, but most things take several applications of water and dry time before setting completely. For the younger kids this toy would be difficult to entertain with, as most younger kids that want instant gratification. Unfortunately the wait for things to dry is pretty long, especially when multiple sprays are needed. If your child doesn't mind the wait, then this toy will be a hit, as it is with my daughter.  What's included in the kit: Pod Pen Tool 4 Pods 400 Beados Spray Bottle Plastic Bead Tray Paper Templates  I purchased this product at full price as a gift for my daughter.

2986,449411,5,9.0,True,"05 11, 2012",A37GDUTBL9PJT1,B0047MKP8O,,Thinking Out Loud,"My daughter received the ""Glow in the Dark Bendaroos - 300 Piece Set"" for Christmas when she was 4 years old. She is now 6 years old, and she continues to go back to this toy over and over again. Now that she's used up some of the colors from that first set, I bought the ""Bendaroos Glow In The Dark 500-Piece Mega Pack"" to keep her supplied with a range of colors.  Only some of the colors are meant to glow in the dark, and of those, the lighter colors glow best. I don't put too much stake in the product's ability to glow in the dark - it's more like a bonus feature for me, and I really don't care if they glow or not. But, my daughter says she likes the way they glow in the dark because she likes to play with them in bed at night, and when I agreed to buy her new Bendaroos, she specifically asked for glow-in-the-dark ones.  My daughter can play with these for at least 20-30 minutes at a time, so they're good for keeping her occupied and quiet.  She sometimes tries to copy the suggested designs, but usually she uses her imagination and creates her own sculptures and art work. She does have trouble when she tries to follow the design instructions, but I don't hold that against the product because I really mostly value it for the way it encourages her to use her imagination.  My daughter's bedroom is wallpapered, and she likes to stick her designs onto her walls. They really do stick and will stay put! At the same time, when they do come down (by choice or by eventually falling down), they don't seem to leave any discoloration or residue on the walls, so I'm happy.  I would suggest using the Bendaroos in rooms with flooring, not carpeting, because their stickiness does pick up a lot of dirt and hair. Every now and then I will find a discarded, crumpled up Bendaroo on my daughter's bedroom floor, and it's pretty gross.  As long as unused pieces are returned to their plastic bags so they don't pick up dirt, they can be used over and over again, which I love. Their stickiness does not seem to wear off as long as you smoosh them around a bit. Whatever the stickiness is does come off on your hands, though, so you'll want to wash your hands after playing with them.",Great imaginative fun!,1336694400,,glow glow-in-the-dark wall supply plastic smoosh like much use find onto work floor wash way feature like value product's dirt come usually product one suggest night hold specifically bendaroos least wear encourages follow fall dark agree residue eventually occupied pick discard trouble bedroom ask minute color hand create ability happy range long put discoloration floor really keep suggest daughter play love lot new return back whatever light try bonus hair pack good instruction use wallpaper first design bendaroo gross continue copy bit want time design imagination would mostly sometimes bed buy leave receive room art carpet year bags buy mega christmas say choice crumple play piece stake i'm quiet stick unused around best set old meant though seem daughter's stickiness sculpture stay go use they're piece every toy use keep care pretty
