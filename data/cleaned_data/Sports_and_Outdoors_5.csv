3,879965,5,True,"04 6, 2015",A1Y0UVFIFJQ3UN,B002MGBEZ0,D. Brown,"I am in no way a yoga expert. I am a beginner who first started on borrowed mats. When I decided to purchase my own, my first stop was a Target I was in, their mats seemed fine, but I wanted to do some research first.  One thing I knew going in was that I wanted the most padding possible because I'm sensitive to hard surfaces when doing many yoga positions and exercises (especially anything involving balancing on my tush and/or tailbone). Many reviews here say this mat is thicker than many others. That, as well as the average five star review and the non-slip extra were reasons for my purchase.  Upon first opening it, the mat seemed shockingly thin; it was certainly thinner than my expectations based on the previous mats I've used which seemed to be lesser quality. But I stepped on, tried a few of my problematic poses and I was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps this mat is just as thick as my borrowed mats but something about the material makes it not flatten under my weight as much as previous mats. I'm just hoping that this doesn't mean my borrowed mats used to perform the same way but flattened overtime, and so I hope it doesn't happen with this mat as well. Time will tell.  There's a definite and strong ""direct off the factory machine"" smell as soon as you break open the cellophane. I'm not worried; I'm certain that smell will go away. I actually like it; it's the scent of guarantee that it's brand-new. :)  The texture feels similar to the previous mats I tried, with just a bit more rigidness to it. This is not bad; it's not uncomfortable and it is not rough. It helps me feel like it has extra grip so I won't slip on it, and it won't slip along the floor.  I purchased the Earth color, and it looks just as it does in the photograph. Obviously I can't say this about the other colors as I have no in person view of them.  I found it interesting how it was rolled up thinking that because the bottom side would lay against the top side when olled up, it had to be rolled the opposite way. Of course, no matter which direction you roll it, the top will make contact with the underside. Oops. I now believe the purpose of the pre-rolled direction is so the mat curves towards the floor when laid out so as not up to curl up towards the ceiling.  For some reason I thought this came with a carrying case, it does not. Do they sell yoga mats cases by themselves? (Not including a caring case is not enough to take away a star in the review.)  So, aside from the not included holder I'm pretty happy with this product so far. Of course I've just received it and haven't spent extensive time on it, I try to update my reviews in cases like this with how the product has been holding up over time.",I Am a Beginner.

There's less feedback than ""cheap"" tires I'm used to with the useless treads too (they're just for looks really, but they do let me know when I'm leaning too far etc). I slipped out on some wet asphalt with grit under it. To be fair I don't think any ""race"" tire could have handled that and I was going into a mild turn with just the rear brake engaged. I wasn't trying to stop, just wanted to slow down and there was nothing there lol. Just don't put too much faith in the grip compound. I'm not sure I'll ever find a bicycle tire that can handle my city's streets. Every time winter rolls around we have these insanely oily streets with the occasional black ice patches. Oily and icy is generally a bad combo for cycling.  As far as dry weather goes, this is the best tire I've ever ridden. I have no desire to buy anything more expensive for my singlespeed commuter bike for now. They roll fast, absorb ALOT of road jargon and seem decent regarding puncture protection. They're light for a commuter class tire as well. If you're a fast commuter such as myself these will help you maintain higher speeds over rough city roads and long distances. If you live in a city that accumulates oil in the streets valley style, you may want something with a different grip tactic than a premium compound and contact patch theory. I also like the Continental Tour Rides, even though they're much slower and are almost knobby. Those are my usual winter tire.  Update:  Switched back to the tour rides for winter and those will be my main tire. I don't know what the deal is, but at really low PSI's (60front 80rear) the tour rides roll like these @ high psi's. It may be my rim profile or something. They feel just as good for fast commuting. Especially in subzero wind chill rides. I didn't doubt the grip once over little icy patches. I will probably never pay for these 4000s ii's tires again. I got a pretty deal though and don't regret the purchase. I just need more grip in my city.

The light is bright enough from even a few hundred feet that a driver would have to be extremely oblivious and distracted not to see it.  Perhaps more importantly, the light will illuminate street signs and signals that are made with a reflective material at distances of over 450 feet away (I measured using google maps). When I first used the light (in flashing mode), I was genuinely shocked to see how the street signs up to two blocks ahead of me were pulsating. I say that this is important because it helps you spot stop signs in the distance - assuming you're being a safe cyclist, biking in a lane, with traffic, abiding by traffic laws, you're probably most likely to get killed by accidently running a stop sign. When I bike home from work at night, I take streets that have no traffic lights and only stop signs, so being able to spot them is very important for me.  The light attaches to your handle bar through via a mount; the light can easily slid off the mount so you don't have to bike around with it during the day, nor leave it on the bike when it's parked outside.  The light does what it needs to do for a reasonable price.

Let me start by stating that i am a high handicapper, and still go through rough spells of inconsistency with my drivers. Here are some pros and cons i have come up with for the evolution tee:  Pros:  Plastic material - This means one tee can take abuse for several holes or even a whole 18.  When i used wooden tees, i would go through them like water. Not that they are very expensive, but i just didn't like having to worry about leaving a tee broken off into the ground. Theres no need to bring 2 or 3 tees to the tee box either.  Reduced drag 3 contact point design - I don't like the standard circular tee-stop shape of most tees.  I feel like i lose distance due to friction from the extra contact with the ball. Evolution takes it a little further and provides shorter width between the 3 contact points on the tee, than you get from traditional 3 point designed tees.  Length -  I find most tees too short. Its nice to have a tee that you can stick into the ground and have it teed up perfectly. The blue bar is perfectly placed on the shaft of the tee, giving guys like me the perfect launch angle. 3 1/4"" is definitely the magic length.  Cons:  Blue bar fades quickly - This could be due to the mishits i experience, but after a 8 holes the blue marking begins to lose its color.  10 holes or so its not a problem, but after that its impossible to see.  Would be wise to have a permanent marker available to color in if you want to reuse the tee for future rounds. Thats only if your a frugal spender though.  No marking for teeing up lower - This is really a minor issue. I have seen this on other tees but not on the evolution; multiple lines for different tee levels. If the blue bar is used theres not much of a concern, but for people who like to tee off lower, i can see this a being  a bit problematic. I find that i can use the blue line for most any shots, but on a windy day this won't cut it do to the loft. Again having a black marker in the bag is good for these circumstances.  Ball falls off tee - Again, this is not a big concern, but unless the tee is perfectly in the ground the ball will not stay on top of the tee. Thats the price you pay for a low friction tee though.  The cons i have listed here are minor in nature, but just wanted to give you a fair appraisal. I hope this has information helps you, and gives you as little bias as possible in purchase this pack of tees. You won't be disappointed if you do.",A durable tee that reduces friction on tee shots.

Does it improve my life?  I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.  RECOMMENDATION  I recommend the Cyclops fluid trainer to anyone looking for alternative ways to get rides in, or for anyone who wants to feel productive while watching TV.  The construction is super solid, and it was very easy to assemble.  FUNCTIONALITY  It works exactly as advertised.  Unlike stationaries and spin bikes, this fluid trainer provides a very road-like feel.  The resistance ramps up as you speed up.  It takes some time to figure out the settings you need - placing the column too loosely against the bike tire results in annoying slippage when you get into the higher gears or higher RPM.  It's tough to get it too tight though, so I tend to just err on that side of things.  It ends up feeling SUPER solid though.  VALUE  Fluid trainers are the most expensive type of trainers.  If you just want to feel productive while watching TV, and you don't really care about tranlating those workouts into real, road-riding improvement, you could save money by getting a magnetic or resistance trainer.  But if you're a road cyclist and this gadget is a means to that end, I'd say the value is there, and you should bite the bullet and spring for the fluid trainer.  DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?  I love being able to get in a workout when the weather is gross, or when it's just too hard to get out of the city.  I love having a nice place to store my bike as well.

However, the difference is in the look of the knife overall and not in the function.  I like the looks of this all black version very much. Side-by-side I would choose the Black version over the standard Flash, however, they are both good knives and it is a matter of preference if you can only choose one.  The black handle and black blade of this version makes it quite appealing.  Even the clip is black with this version, which is a nice touch.  I would recommend lubrication and any personal preference adjustments to the ""action"" of the knife immediately so you can begin to use the knife right away with optimal results.  I already own one of these as an EDC knife and that is why I have purchased more.  This knife is quite sharp out of the box and it opens quickly.  I like the ""safety"" feature that locks the blade so that it doesn't open accidentally.  The best feature for me is the low profile clip that allows the knife to be carried but not seen.  It is elevated a bit off the end of the knife so that no part of the knife shows outside your pocket.  All that is visible is the clip.  Most knifes have a small portion of the knife end that sticks out of the pocket.  With this style of knife, you can't see any of the knife outside the pocket.  This makes this a discreet EDC knife that is also functional and of an excellent quality.  The handle is quite sturdy and has textured feel that increases the grip.  The partially serrated blade is quite helpful in getting through boxes, rope, plastic, etc.  Overall this is a lightweight and handy knife that is worth the price and superb for EDC.  If it is stiff or doesn't open the way you like, just adjust the end screw and lubricate it with a drop of oil.  I have also used WD-40 on this style of knife and it does wonders cleaning it and making it look brand new again.",I like the look of this Black version better than the standard Flash,1292112000,,22.0,,look box nice away elevate plastic black much serrate use quite open wonder way feature like immediately result however recommend visible handy rope function action open carry can't clip sturdy textured make already blade feel begin partially preference handle box accidentally appeal brand see knives one optimal touch part new quality right sharp low knife increase good lock discreet quickly use worth outside knife bit price flash side-by-side version safety purchase lubricate would write stick profile standard etc also lightweight even see functional cleaning matter basically drop lubrication edc adjustment choose show superb style oil pocket best overall helpful look excellent screw end make stiff allows adjust non-black get difference personal grip small portion review

This gun is my ""throw around"" gun that takes more of a beating compared to my more expensive rifles. It also stays under my bed instead of getting locked up in my safe. I purchased this model solely based on the price and the fact that I already had a pair of 1 in Ruger Scope rings (5 - High). I couldn't be happier with the VALUE of this scope. It is very clear, sturdy, and holds up well compared to more expensive scopes with illuminated reticles. The lowest setting is slightly more than 1x ""true"" magnification but my target recognition with this thing is still FAST! The 4x setting is just enough for me to reach out to the max distances that I would ever want to shoot a .223 out to. If you need the benefits of a 1-4 but don't want the extra cost of illumination this is a great option.  Items of Note: 1) I thought the ""Pig Plex"" written on the reticle would be very annoying but it is not. I'm too focused on the clarity of the glass! 2) I thought I wouldn't get annoyed with the words ""Hog"" written on the caps but its turns out I do. I will probably get those replaced some day. 3) The outer crosshairs of the reticle are thick. I was worried about this but found it slightly helpful when trying to quickly get on target.

There is a small bit of info for each screen that I have found in the app, but so far I find it very confusing to know what each screen means.  Maybe because all of my dry shots were 93% or higher so it didn't have much to say.  I will live fire with it tomorrow and see if that changes but overall I am disappointed with it. Not because it isn't good, but because I am not clear on what it is showing me.  I feel like it should have come with a manual.  I have updated my rating to five stars after taking it to the range.

Recently I went backpacking on the Lost Coast Trail and got a little wet which meant I had to dry a few things by the fire at night.  As a result I decided I needed at least one waterproof bag and after this one will probably get another.  I am going camping after I write this but the forecast is for good weather so it will be unnecessary for this trip but our next trip is a kayak camping trip where this will really be necessary.  To test it I stuffed it with two days worth of clothes and I had room left over.  I put it on the top of our outside spa and it literally rained all day.  The following morning after the sun came out I took a couple of photos of the bag itself. You can see the bag partially filled and the other photo is the bag after raining all night and there's still water on the spa cover with the bag. I removed all of my clothes and not a drop of water nor feeling of dampness at all.  I did not try floating in water as another reviewer did so cannot say what that difference would be but it definitely withstood a full day of rain. It's big enough for several days of clothes but of course that depends on what clothes you pack.  After stuffing the bag you simply roll the opening up and secure it with the Velcro handle.  The bag holds air which we will keep for kayaking but the next backpack trip we will get the air out first to make it easier to pack.  As I said we will get at least one more so we can each have one.  Definitely a great product especially for the price.

We've done the video together as a family and there are definitely some positives.  I would guess the video will appeal most to kids from toddler ages through 7 or 8.  Older than that and they may or may not find it a little too ""babyish"" as my 9 year old son would say (though he did the video with mom, dad, and 5 year old sister and seemed to enjoy it despite the obligatory complaints about it being babyish, so even older kids might like it).

The instructor makes the most of things, keeping a nice chipper & fun demeanor without condescending to the point of alienating dads like me.

The finished product is sturdy, has a wide, long belt and feels like the machines in my gym. It is important to know before buying that it does take up a bit of space and while made to be easy to move, is quite large for a middle aged woman to move around. Delivery: Amazon scheduled a delivery with a service near my home. They had to change it once but were able to provide a 4 hour window so I was not waiting long. The box itself is VERY heavy (250 lbs) and awkward to move. The delivery was made by one individual so my son and I had to lug the box into the room where the machine would go. If you had to go up multiple levels or have a narrow staircase, you would really need several people to carry it. Installation: There are several important things to know before opening the box. These are all things that will make your experience with the installation better than mine. First, you will need some space to build this item so make sure you have given yourself enough space. Second, make sure that you have the box with the correct side up. It is labelled. Unfortunately, the box is really heavy and we could not turn it over. We wound up opening the box upside down and pulling each item out of the back. Third, make sure you do NOT cut the yellow cord. There are little signs on the cord in the front that indicate you should not cut it as well as notes in the instruction book. Unfortunately, the instructions and the signs were under the giant treadmill piece so were not visible if you open the box upside down. Cutting the cord caused the hydraulics to pop leaving a nasty bruise on my arm. It is very important to open the box the right way and to NOT cut that cord. Even though we did cut the cord, we still were able to manage assembly but it required some strength and room to flip the base appropriately. The materials that were provided were labelled well so we knew we had all the required pieces. It took about 2 and a half hours with 3 people assembling the treadmill. Two people could probably do most of the assembly but one or two parts required careful line up of the holes. We did take a little bit of time to understand where to gently kick the hydraulic in order for the machine to lower, but once we figured that out it was smooth sailing. Machine itself: The machine seems well built, not flimsy. I have not yet mastered all of the options but it has many programs, can store several profiles and compare your progress as you go. There is room for a book or ipad (although I wish the spot was a little deeper). There is ample room for keys, water, phone, remote. The first time I turned it on, it did trip my sensitive outlets but after flipping the breaker, I have not had that same problem again. The only con I have is that it should have a longer cord as I have my machine on an angle away from the wall so I have to use an extension cord in order to plug it in.",Great Treadmill (but come on with the length of the plug),1421020800,,3.0,,know sign extension treadmill second spot phone breaker away move awkward pop option base deep assembly use quite remote assemble long belt way ample smooth like understand wide order woman yellow service space hour cut visible program could near need half product nasty room upside open hydraulics turn book important several many sturdy enough open kick take change cause seem buying sure careful multiple problem feel leave third indicate note hydraulic master profile mine although age well middle long cord box unfortunately sail line flip lbs star little thing really machine staircase one manage pull wall delivery wait turn back make arm right impressive cut angle compare installation able home take instruction large probably machine amazon first hour bit sensitive bruise time schedule would flimsy part item level narrow strength material still provide even figured water wish giant easy front flip appropriately instruction make side experience provide outlet round store key label build build window plug piece around overall two require yet correct finish hole progress ipad though son gym wind gently trip con people heavy go knew well individual lug piece carry give low

They came with a total of 6 sleeves however he only is using 4 of them since 2 of them are not his colors of choice. He got many compliments from his teammates and decided to give one of the colors to his teammate as he doesnt have a set. Last night was a true test of the product as it was pretty cold last night and he said they did the job. He kept praising the sleeves and was very happy. When he first approached me to buy sleeves I had no clue what the purpose of them was. It took me talking to another teammates mother who told me about them and how much she paid for her sons at a local retail store for one set. I thought they were overly priced for something just made to cover the arms. When I found these for the price and a total of 6 I had to give them a try. The quality of the material and workmanship if of high standards. These sleeves stretch to fit the smallest to the large arms and does not cut of the circulation in the muscles by being too tight.

The material quality feels sturdy and the stitching seems extremely well done, I did a pretty thorough search on the pack and did not see any loose or fraying ends. The MOLLE works exactly as you would expect and I can't think of anything else to add on it except that there is a great amount(Both front pockets, both sides, shoulder strap and bottom. The shoulder straps them self are extremely comfortable with thick padding. The hip belt is thinner though without padding (About the same thickness as the MOLLE webbing although a wider overall strap).  The hydration pouch padding is comfortable and thick enough to protect the bladder(which as mentioned in a previous review is large enough for a 3L bladder), this pocket which is about 15 inches by 11 inches was also large enough to hold my laptop (15 inch screen) and the charger fit well in the top pocket.  Both pockets in front are about 2 inches deep, the top one (About 8 inches by 5) doesn't have any divider pockets while the bottom pocket (roughly 8 inches by 9 1/2)has a smaller admin pocket in it big enough to hold a cd case or note pad (I currently have a shirt pocket size Rite in the Rain Notebook in there w/ room to spare). In front of that admin slot there are multiple smaller pockets the left most one perfect for a nice size multitool and the others for a sharpie, pens or pencils)  The second compartment in front of the Main compartment is a bit deeper than the front pockets and about 16 inches by 9 inches and the zipper for this pocket run about half way down the bag. This pocket also has a small admin pocket similar to the one I described in the last pocket however on the outside of it rather than having the pen/multitool size pockets it has 2 mesh pockets (each one is exactly have the width of the pocket they are on top of and run the entire length of that pocket).  The main pocket is roughly 4 and a half inches deep and 19 inches by 12. This compartment can unzip all the way to the bottom of the pack so you can really organize well in here. One side has a zipper pocket that goes almost all the way across and the other has a Mesh pocket that goes all the way across.  The bottom also has some nice compression straps to hold sleep system or tent. There are also 4 other compression straps on the pack bringing the total to 6 so you can really get your gear strapped tight for minimal movement.  The estimated delivery time was nearly a month and a half from the date I ordered it since it is shipping from out of the country however I received it in 8 days and it was I received an email that it had shipped the same day I ordered it. There are a few things that I would of changed although they are more me nitpicking than complaints, the first being the zippers, they are paracord instead of an actual zipper which I would prefer however they seem extremely sturdy still and actually are a little easier to operate then a smaller metal zipper. Another thing is that the bottom of the pack is the same material as the rest rather than a more water resistant material (the inside is PVC coated so shouldn't be an issue). and lastly I would of liked some sort of padding on the hip belt but again the current one is serviceable and the pack is comfortable and light. Overall this is a beautifully put together pack that rivals or beats many packs of a much higher price.

The lid stays closed very securely with a latch that clicks into place as well as a metal ring that holds it shut.  In order to open it, you must pull down the metal ring and then press the button to release the lid.  This ensures that the lid will not accidentally come open when it's being carried in a bag or if it falls over.  The lid also has a small handle that makes it easy to tote around. The bottle itself holds 32oz of liquid, which is a good amount more than other water bottles or infuser bottles I have owned.  There is a soft grip on the side of the bottle, which makes it easy to grip while drinking from it, or just carrying it.  This bottle comes with a neoprene sleeve that slides on, which helps with insulating your beverage.  The sleeve is open at the bottom so that the bottle is able to stand upright without worry of it toppling over because of uneven sleeve material covering the bottom of the bottle.  I've seen this with several other bottles on the market, and always thought the design was a bit flawed, so I'm glad that this one has the open-bottomed sleeve.  The sleeve is a little bit loose around a cut out area on its side where the bottle's grip is accessible, and I think it would look a lot nicer if it were fitted (maybe the material needs to be more stretchy). The infuser portion fits easily into the top of the bottle, and can be easily removed as well.  This allows the bottle to be used for an infused beverage, or just a normal one like water or juice. I'm really enjoying this bottle so far, and would recommend it both as an infuser and just a normal water bottle.

But when those situations DO arise, I'm certainly glad I have it!  It instantly demands the attention of all drivers in earshot.  This thing is LOUD, and people WILL pay attention when they hear it.  Great for situations where drivers seem to think you're invisible (about to merge into you, about to turn left in front of you, about to right hook you, about to pull in front of you, etc).  I feel that those times I needed to use it, it certainly kept me from either getting hit or having to make an emergency stop (and risk flying over the handlebars). The only downside I could find is that the volume knob seems to be more or less worthless.  As I understand it, it works by decreasing airflow.  Because of this, you need to test that you don't have it turned down TOO low, or else you don't get any noise.  But even when you can get it turned down just right, it's still so loud as to be overkill on sidepaths where you encounter mostly pedestrians, joggers, and other cyclists.  Great for the road, but in my opinion, not great for sidepaths.  A nice tool for the toolbox.  For me, a mirror is more important though.

Material looks like it could protect from thorns and glass and it doesn't look like cheap liners from the bike store.  I usually ride 50+ miles a week and I occasionally get a flat from super small pieces of glass. Recently, I rode to work and had to change a tube in the bike room. I talked with a cyclist and I vented my frustration to him about having flat tires for a while now. He told me to get a ""liner"" for the road bike and this was the first time I heard of that idea. This other cyclist also has a liner (not sure of which company) and has not had any flats for over 6 months. I was quite surprised to hear that because I was replacing a flat ever 1/2 weeks and paying for $6 inner tubes each time. Usually my back tire always get flat but front has always stayed sharp the whole time without liners.  After hearing of this concept. I decided to get on Amazon and do tire liner research. Mr. Tuffy does seem like the best tire liner considering all the other stuff can be knockoffs and fakes, or just plain cheap quality. The quality of this product will pay itself off in 1 month or less just by saving you 2 flats. But it doesn't even come down to that because it can save probably over 20 flats easy.

I rubbed a Pinesol-soaked rag on all the plates' rubber surfaces, and then later wiped off the Pinesol residue with damp rags. Those efforts did reduce the smell.  The build quality of the rubber coatings is good. I find the weights easy to grip and maneuver, since they have over-sized handles (and the rubber helps).

They hold extremely tight, are light weight, and weather proof.  I have put a lot of road miles with these lights attached to my shoes and never once have they came close to falling off.  They are so light weight that I can't even feel them while I am running.  I've also ran in the rain and through puddles without any issues.  The lights are super bright.  My wife can see me running several blocks away from home when I have them activated a night.  I think of them as my tail lights for traffic approaching you from behind.  The lights have little teeth on the inside of the light that grip the rear heel of your shoe and hold like glue.  In fact, it's pretty tough getting them back off once you have them on.  Like I said, they hold like glue in place and never move, so you won't have any damage to your shoes.  To activate the light, there is a button on the side.  One push gives you a steady light, two pushes give you a flashing light, and if you hold the button the light shuts off.  The packaging states that the steady light will give you 20+ hours of battery life and the flashing light gives you 40+ hours of battery life.  The packaging also states that the lights are 4 Lumens, are weather resistant (which I've proved already) and are Ragnar approved.  I purchased a both versions, a red light and a green light to give me contrasting colors to add visibility to approaching motorists.  Like I said before, these lights are a must for nighttime runs.","Great, super bright heel lights for nighttime runners!",1453593600,{'Color:': ' Red'},2.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UvUN-DKYL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zJb-ksQJL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UFVZjPSBL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NoaaEu00L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71A-F2m+QiL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gAG-xzZTL._SY88.jpg']","give proof a-spacing-small away move type=""hidden push i've bright packaging approve button extremely like come steady red say hour activate rear add shoe think approach state tail hold night battery can't tight fall several name nighttime great run already teeth visibility feel color must wife a-spacing-top-mini flashing shoe put little rain one fact push video-block""></div><input green lot back div activate place class=""video-url""><input class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;these low home give super version light light weight purchase shuts mile damage issue also close even see block inside prove road contrast puddle heel side class=""a-section never motorists glue run condition two traffic run attach without run life lumens weather resistant behind ragnar tough get spur grip pretty"

It was my go to knife for lots of wilderness outings and I always felt very confidant that if I needed it, it would not fail me. I really like how far the handle sticks out at the bottom making for a very comfortable  grip when chopping, also the palm swells really make this knife a pleasure to hold and use, it fits like a glove.  I was very disappointing by the sheath however.  It is hard to get the blade in and out of.  Makes a very loud click whenever you draw or sheath it.  The thumb strap was difficult to secure and would often spin so that it was not lined up properly making quick stowing of the knife hard.  Most disappointing of all the thumb strap broke on my last trip.  I think it got snagged on some foliage or something.  This made the knife unwearable for the rest of the trip as the weight is not properly carried by the sheath and the knife would flop around at hang upside down.  I would recommend this blade but understand that you are going to have to invest in a new sheath if you actually plan on using it as a wilderness/survival tool.

We decided that with our daughter getting into girl scouts, we didn't want to have to lug around such a large tent.  My wife purchased this one on a whim.  I have to say I am fairly impressed with the quality for the price.  The tent goes up very easily.  One person can put it up in only about 5-10 minutes, but a second person makes it much easier to get the rain fly over the top.  There are storage pockets on the sides of the tent, and a mesh square that clips onto the tent and suspends from the top of the tent, where you can put more items.  It is not strong enough to store heavy items, but is great for putting an LED lantern, wallet, keys, etc.  The zipper is covered on the outside with a flap of material to help keep water from seeping into the tent through the zipper.  It goes from one side of the zipper to the other at a certain point to keep water from running down into the zipper.  This leads to the zipper hanging up frequently, but I know the first time we camp in the rain I will appreciate it.  My only real complaint is that with the tent body only staking down in the four corners, the front entry tends to be high.  My wife, son, daughter, dog, and I all tripped over it at least once (or more) times during 3 days of camping.

First, having had larger bags in the past I didn't want the temptation to load it up such that it would threaten the integrity of the plastic mounting system (which BTW seems pretty robust and I""m not worried about it failing any time soon, unlike the Ibera bar bag I had prior to this one)..  Depending on how you count this thing has around 20 (!) separate compartments; granted, about 10 of them are in and on the very top zippered part several of which are designed for not much larger than credit card sized objects but regardless this bag lets you keep many small things neatly sorted which is IME much better than having a jumble of loose items in fewer larger compartments.  That said, I was able to cram a large cotton hoodie in the main compartment after unfastening the velcro attached divider.  To sum: what I like is I can find a nook for just about every small item I want to carry and retrieve them all with minimal fuss and I bet I could stuff at least five 12 oz beer cans (and maybe a sixer!) in the main compartment and what more could you want? <wink>  Plus there's kind of a hidden area when you open the zipper in the main compartment which would be excellent for a passport and other important papers.  The quick release mechanism is one of the easiest ones I've ever used with the only downside being they made the release bright yellow alerting potential thieves it is a mechanism for something... given that you don't really need to see the release to use it making it black to match the rest of the mount would be much better.

Hill,"There is so much wrong and so little right it is hard to know where to begin but narrowing this down to the most egregious problem -- the water bottle leaks which subjects the phone to possible damage. No special closure/seal was incorporated into the design to ensure the safety of the phone. The cap on a standard disposable bottle of water is more secure than the one on this bottle. In fact the entire bottle is just not the quality I would expect from a re-usable unit like this one.  And, as a secondary but also significant problem, the odor from the plastic used to manufacture the bottle is overpoweringly repugnant. The chemical smell is so strong that every survival instinct I possess tells me not to drink from the bottle, so I won't. Washing the bottle did not dissipate the smell.  There are other problems like the thick clear window that makes using the touch screen clunky, and the earphone jack opening that is largely not well-placed, but it is particularly hard to overlook the discrepancy between the picture of the holder on the product page and the one I was sent.  I have no idea what transpired between the pictured unit (prototype?) and the final result, but the design and materials used in the picture definitely look superior to the actual holder. For example, the part that holds the phone appears at least partially separate from the bottle which would offer somewhat more protection from the leaking bottle although it is unclear if it would provide sufficient insulation from water drips. The area surrounding the top of the bottle in the picture appears to be vinyl, which would provide additional drip protection. In contrast, the holder I received has no vinyl to shield, and the phone slides into a slit right up against the water bottle without any separation. Both of these design changes make the leaking bottle a potentially more problematic.

I have the grill plate that comes with it, but also have the stove plate and the griddle plate too - they all fit nicely in here.  If you plan to have all 3 cooking surfaces be sure to pack with care so the stove plate is on the underside of the griddle plate or grill plate to prevent scratching - wrapping it in an old towel doesn't hurt either.  It also holds a nice long utility lighter as well to keep everything at the ready.  If you are purchasing this bag and aren't getting the other cooking surfaces to use with it this bag could easily hold a fair amount of picnic supplies, probably everything but large cups and the food itself.  The propane tank holders on the side are utterly convenient as well.

Guida,"Having owned my MRO for about 10 months now, I definitely feel it's a good optic for the money and am generally happy with my purchase. Having heard of some of the QC issues on this model, I was definitely a bit hesitant at first, but mine has performed very well so far and have a lot of confidence in Trijicon that they stand behind their products.  All that being said, the MRO is not a perfect red dot and if you are seriously interested in purchasing it, there are a few things you should know about it beforehand. If you can live with these issues, then you will probably be very happy with it.  Bluish Hue: The optical clarity of the MRO is quite excellent, just like every other Trijicon optic I've used, but when shooting with both eyes open, there is a slight, but noticeable bluish hue to the lens. I have however found this coloration is more noticeable indoors than when used in natural light outdoors. Though I personally prefer a more colorless optic, I don't think it's an issue and hasn't adversely affected the function of the optic on any practical level.  Magnification: For me, this is the biggest con of the MRO and something that caught me by surprise when I first tried it. This optic has a very, very slight, but noticeable amount of magnification to it. When shooting with both eyes open, the closer you are to the target, the more noticeable the magnification becomes. On a practical level, it doesn't really affect function for me, though if I were using it more in very close quarters, I might have more of an issue with it. Regardless, for $500 +/-, it's a little disappointing considering I've used Holosun optics that were less than half the cost of the MRO that didn't have these issues, are perfectly clear and close to, if not as durable.  Glare: Yes. In certain situations there is some glare to this optic and if you crank up the brightness too much in darker spaces, you will notice this, and in some cases, a halo effect. Glare will also be an issue when exposed to direct sunlight. Part of this I attribute to the large objective and feel that's just a price you pay, although I imagine some of it may be reduced with the use of a kill flash. Regardless,  when using the correct brightness settings for your environment, most of these potential issues shouldn't give you any problems.  Lens covers: There are not a whole lot of options for lens covers for the MRO and the ones you can find are severely overpriced in my opinion. Fortunately, I found a tip online that suggested the Butler Creek #17 for the front objective and sure enough, it works great! Highly recommended.  Summary: Overall I definitely like my MRO very much. But if you're seriously in the market for one, I would strongly suggest trying it out first before buying and especially, comparing it to other red dots like the AimPoint Micro as there are distinct Pros/Cons to each that will likely influence your preference. Lastly, unless you are LEO or Military, I would also suggest also comparing it to some of the Primary Arms / HoloSun optics offer some very competitive options at less than half the cost.","Not perfect, but a very good red dot",1484956800,{'Style Name:': ' Mro With Low Mount'},,,know case give slight adversely product colorless much option i've amount quite use find consider coloration natural notice optic like butler red say model however space prefer level quarter bluish cover generally pay market heard half noticeable might regardless perfect think one function open cost attribute shoot objective suggested optical creek problem strongly perform environment affect indoors enough hue compare leo recommend definitely something tip direct sure great buying dot eye hesitant feel mine pros/cons money surprise interested happy less purchase find although fortunately preference severely lastly little micro qc thing really affect that's outdoors overprice suggest one beforehand personally holosun part offer lot issue summary aimpoint whole reduce far try sunlight primary live yes likely seriously own good durable situation crank online use probably perfectly expose large kill first effect target bit price flash influence light certain month highly purchase mro especially would military practical imagine issue lens also close potential work arm closer distinct darker front opinion clarity brightness catch magnification big optic disappoint becomes overall correct dot tried excellent though behind con halo unless setting well use confidence glare every may competitive trijicon clear stand

Fitness bands all seem to have inherent issues with counting too many steps.  In the case of the Vivosmart, I found that it was counting up to thousands of additional steps during the day.  I think this is because they are on the wrist that moves during the day vs on or near the waist that does not.

1126,85824,4,False,"03 19, 2016",A3HJHWCJUI4RTQ,B000ACAMJC,Grognak Volpe,"I have mixed feelings about this horn. While it's loud and works well for getting people's attention in an emergency, it also is bulky and has limited mounting options. As others have stated, it is very loud and in my opinion should only be used in emergency situations such as a car pulling out in front of you. I also bought an electronic horn for comparison.  Bell Pros: Polite. Small. Inexpensive. Good for letting people know you're passing. Versatile mounting options. Weatherproof. No batteries or filling with air required. Cons: Not very loud. Drivers won't hear it. People jogging with headphones might not hear it.  Electronic Horn Pros: Medium size. Medium price. Loud. Cons: Strictly on/off with no control over volume by pressing harder/softer. Unless you get one with a remote trigger they have very limited mounting options, especially if you want to access it while braking. Makes an unusual sound that might make drivers look around rather than stop. Requires batteries and probably not water resistant.  Airzound Pros: Loudest option and better at getting people's attention rather than just making them curious like electronic horn can do. Volume adjustable with tool as well as how hard you press trigger. Refillable with bike pump. Some variety with mounting options. Durable (I've had mine for years). Cons: Bulky and difficult to mount in a clean looking way. Uses up water bottle cage. Difficult, but not impossible to mount on road bike to activate while braking. Way too loud for getting people attention in a friendly way. High price.  What I ended up doing was mounting a small bell in reach of my thumb on my left handlebar, and the Airzound on the right in reach of my pinky finger. While none of the horns I've tried appear to be designed for mounting this way, I did so so I can activate them while braking. I also wrapped some electrical tape around the Airzound tubing to get it out of the way. It would look better if you mounted it underneath the bar tape.

The frames are slightly too small for my face (which isn't really a knockout feature for me) and the color isn't masculine enough.  (My kids tease me for wearing ""chick glasses"".)  Having said that, they're still great glasses and I'll wear them when my daughters aren't around.  :)  Aside from that, THESE GLASSES ARE AMAZING.  I can't believe how much you get for such a reasonable price.  ___________________ Included:  * A nice hard-shell zippered case. * Sturdy rims (even if they aren't macho enough for my kids' dad). * Soft cleaning cloth * FIVE SETS OF LENSES!!!! * A groovy carrier for the four spare sets of lenses. The carrier sticks to to the inside of the case with Velcro. It's kind of cool yet creepy how spare lenses squint out at you from the carrier.  I'm pretty rough on glasses, so having five sets of lenses is amazing.  They even come with clear lenses if you just need basic eye protection (see the warning below about the protection though).  The lenses are notched to allow your forehead to breath.  That's great for me, because I tend to sweat a lot and fog up my glasses.  I haven't fogged these up yet.  However, the notches leave a small amount of room where bugs or road debris could get through and compromise the eye protection.  I guess I have one more minor gripe.  I wish the packaging had included instructions for swapping the lenses.  It's not super obvious how you do it, so check their website if you get stuck.  They included SO MUCH with this product; it would have been great if they'd gone one step further and included product documentation.

If you want to add the fiber optic to your Sig, these work very well and profile wise they are barely taller than the factory sights.  The only potential issue I see is that the front sights extends much further rearward than the original sight, and the rear extends much further forward, and there is a small gap between the gun and the sight here.  The gap is much bigger than I think it should be, I do not know if this is due to some expected manufacturing tolerance on the Sig's or if it is because this goes on several different models.  Regardless, be sure to configure your holster such that clothing or straps do not get hung up in this gap.  On a west german P226 slide, this gap is big enough to fit 5 pieces of heavy laser printer paper under the front sight, and 6 under the rear sight.  I am concerned that bumping the far (hanging) edge of the sights could flexand damage them just due to the weight of the gun.  I believe this is why some complain of breaking out the fiber optic part of the sight.","These are very nice, but large gap between sight and slide, certainly not as durable as OEM Sig night sight",1398297600,"{'Color:': ' Green Front, Green Rear', 'Style Name:': ' Sig Sauer #8 Front / #8 Rear Sets'}",3.0,,know go hung much work clothe small optic holster tolerance rear sig's could edge add regardless truglo's think bump impressed west get configure several fiber due enough barely extend gun big sure different factory flexand break part model issue laser complain original far believe fit big printer want weight gap profile damage wise paper potential sight see dissapoint rearward front concern taller forward hang sight german strap slide heavy well expect sig piece manufacturing

The only thing stopping me was price.  Now, imagine the utter joy I experienced when I saw this listed on amazon.  I could have something similar for a fraction of the price!  Yay!  I put machete in quotes in the title because I find it hard to call this a machete.  It's huge and intimidating, and it basically feels like a sword when handling it.  The blade is about 2lbs, 24 inches long, and the steel is fairly thick.  It definitely packs a punch.  The handle is steel reinforced with a lanyard hole at the bottom.  The case is made of nylon, fastened with rivets and reinforced at the bottom, where the point of the blade will rest.  Friction keeps the blade secure in the case, but it also has a nylon loop to attach to the handle with a snap button to secure it while in the case.  The blade is 1055 carbon steel.  What does that mean, you ask?  Here is a copy/paste straight from a google search:  1055 steel is right on the border between a medium and a high carbon steel, with a carbon content between 0.50%-0.60% and with manganese between 0.60%-0.90% as the only other component. The carbon content and lean alloy make this a shallow hardening steel with a quenched hardness between Rc 60-64 depending on exact carbon content. These combination of factors make this one of the toughest steels available because, when quenched, it produces a near saturated lathe martensite with no excess carbides, avoiding the brittleness of higher carbon materials. This steel is particularly suited to applications where strength and impact resistance is valued above all other considerations and will produce blades of almost legendary toughness.  There were just a couple things I wasn't thrilled with.  The edge that came on the blade was very uneven.  Some spots would be razor sharp and other spots seemed to be skimmed over quickly and rather dull.  It didn't take too much to fix it, but it was noticeable.  I also don't see why they don't put the sticker on the cover of the blade instead of the blade itself.  The sticker left a lot of residue I have yet to get off.  {EDIT: The cyclops, in comment section, suggested WD-40 to get the sticker residue off.  It worked beautifully.  Thank you!}  Overall I would definitely recommend purchasing the Cold Steel Cutlass Machete, especially if you are like me and find the real Cold Steel Cutlass just too expensive to justify a purchase.

I opened the package and removed the Mace bottle and started reading the instructions. While reading the instructions I had rubbed one of my eyes, and touched my nose. After a few minutes I noticed my eye and nose started burning and it was getting quite painful. At first I didn't make the connection between the mace and the burning because it wouldn't make sense that by just touching the packaging and mace bottle would be dangerous to the owner of the product. But the product packaging mentions that the mace bottle had been test fired so I looked at the mace bottle and noticed some brown colored material in the nozzle. I then inspected the inside of the clamshell package and I could see it was wet in spots inside. So that's how I apparently got the mace on my hands and then eye and nose. I called Amazon and the customer service rep told me that the package should have been sealed. They refunded my money and gave me a $20 credit for my bad experience. They said they didn't want the mace back because it is hazardous material. I still wanted this particular product so I ordered another one. When it arrived it was still not in a sealed package and when I took a close look at it without opening it (the clamshell was hanging open in the shipping box) I noticed the bottle had been leaking inside the packaging. This time I called the Mfg and talked to them about all this and they assured me that all there products are shipped in sealed clamshell packages. They told me that someone at Amazon must be opening the packages for some reason and spraying the mace. They took my name and address and said they would mail me one. What I received was the same exact clamshell package unsealed but in a sealed plastic bag. I inspected the contents and found that unlike the 2 bottles of mace that I received from Amazon, this bottle had a clean nozzle and no sign of leakage inside the package. I contacted Amazon about this again and I was told they would track this problem down and e-mail me a response to their investigation, but I never received that response.

After a month I got a Benchmade for my dad, he loved it.    Pros: -  US company & made in the US. -  Excellent quality, fit & finish - I can see why Benchmade has a lot of loyal fans.  I own & have owned over the years several other major brands & the only other brands that are/were at least equally impressive are ZT (Zero Tolerance) and maybe Spyderco. -  Great ergonomics, super comfortable handle with some ""smooth texturing"" of the G10 material that ensures a firm grip even with wet hands or handle.  Lays in the hand nicely in both normal & reverse grip. -  Thumb-stud to open is super easy to use 1-handed (either right- or left-hand), was able to open it easily right out of the box, didn't need weeks of ""getting used to it"" like some others.  And this was my 1st use of Benchmade's thumb stud, so it's not like I'd had tons of practice ahead of time.  Still, method of opening is personal preference - I personally don't like Spyderco's thumb-hole style that tons of people love, & I gave it an honest try. -  Perfect knife for either right-hand or left-hand opening & use - thumb studs on both sides of blade.  Pocket clip can be flipped to reverse side, though in default position I think works fine for left-hand carry also (yes I often carry left-handed). -  Very smooth pivot action, no detectable wiggle. -  Love the unusual reverse-tanto blade design, blade centering is darn near perfect - just *very* slightly off-center but has never rubbed or hit the liner. -  Excellent 154CM blade steel - a good choice for an everyday use knife, holds an edge nicely while not a bear to sharpen, good corrosion resistance. -  Really like the Axis lock system - clever design that's a solid lock & easily disengaged 1-handed either right-hand or left-hand. Nubs to disengage the lock are easy to reach but totally unobtrusive. -  Feels solid in the hand, moderate weight for me but not heavy. -  Bonus: really like the looks of it, especially the gray/black patterned handle - I'm pretty tired of boring all black or all silver handle designs.  Maybe not everyone's preference, but if this is going to be for everyday use, looks shouldn't be a deal-breaker.  If this is just going into a collection it's definitely eye-catching - the design stood out on the maker's website, so I looked at it first before any other Benchmade folders. -  You have the option of ordering the Rift model with a plain edge or with a black-coated partly serrated edge.    Neutral: -  Has a lanyard hole for those who like that.  I normally wouldn't use it unless taking this out on a boat. -  Apparently auto-opening is an option for the 950 Rift but that's extra cost.    Cons: -  Honestly can't think of any, being as objective as I can.  Though some might miss having jimping (ie ""ridges"") on the back of the blade for thumb grip for heavy use.  I have knives with & without jimping, personally it's never made a huge difference for me.",6 months review - great knife!,1515283200,{'Color:': ' Plain Edge/Satin Finish'},,,look black eye-catching month pattern serrate apparently maybe hand use week thumb-hole nicely default smooth wet like flipped ensures love darn model extra thumb disengage tolerance practice loyal edge near clever need boat liner take fine might try perfect think order others open action cost objective normal normally least impressed can't clip silver pro several lanyard i'd dad open con disengage ton definitely tire reverse-tanto everyday great solid wiggle slightly feel equally hand blade steel totally everyone's fan corrosion left-handed box handle preference look neutral huge pivot moderate finish really jimping knife sharpen position lock that's deal-breaker axis website personally resistance love lot quality left-hand back texturing make rift right impressive bonus option unobtrusive material yes able go company own good hole detectable use side nubs fit comfortable thumb-stud collection maker's first design boring knife super major folder center weight honestly month zero time spyderco's design reverse get especially miss method hold lay unusual stood also still are/were firm ahead honest work see even bear brand hit benchmade's easy easily off-center stud year plain benchmade side reach auto-opening ergonomics either never choice ie i'm style pocket often rub ridge without excellent though system partly black-coated stud zt gray/black people heavy get right-hand difference carry personal grip spyderco unless pretty give

1336,2100399,5,False,"09 8, 2015",A2VYLXYG3H6TYN,B00V9H1VDI,Aundrea,"I do yoga almost daily due to back pain. It seems to be one of the only things that helps. I have another yoga strap that I like, but it's bulkier and not something I can put in my yoga bag easily. Here are a few thoughts on it:  -Strap loops: The is a little different than my other strap. They both have loops, but my other one has loops that don't lay flat when rolled up. So, with it there's the strap and then the loop is a longer piece of strap, so it doesn't roll up nicely. They both function the same. -Function: Having a strap has changed how well I can do some of my poses. I love having the ability to really ease into a pose and add a little tension to maximize it as my muscles stretch out. I highly recommend a strap for anyone doing yoga. -Quality/Price: This is an excellent strap for the price. In reality, we all know more expensive products are usually a little better. My other strap is $19.99 and is a little nicer, although I mentioned it isn't as compact to take with me. It has a little padding for when I use it under my feet and the overall quality is slightly better. But, for $5.99 this is an excellent product and I have been enjoying it a lot. It does everything the more expensive straps do. When I look closely at it I don't see any concerns about the quality. The stitching isn't done as thoroughly as with my other strap, but again, this is 1/3 the price.  Overall, I love the strap and have it in my yoga bag. It rolls up flat and I store it in the plastic case it came in. I was sent this for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on the rating or review I am giving it. I will update my review if I run into any problems. Here are my few favorite stretches to do with it.  Hamstring stretch/seated forward fold: Before I would just lean forward trying to touch my toes. I have very long legs and tight hamstrings, so I sometimes cant touch my toes, depending on my workouts and stretching. I can use this strap to slowly work my way towards touching my toes. I stay in the stretch for a minute or two. Slowly breathing in and out, pulling myself with the strap gently towards my toes with each exhale. Cow face pose: I can only touch my hands behind my back with my left arm reaching over the top and my right arm reaching behind, the strap helps me increase my flexibility on my bad side by allowing me to still do the stretch with a little tension. Reclining foot to big toe pose: I LOVE this pose with a strap. I lay on my back with one leg flat on the ground. I put the strap around the other foot and raise it at a 90 degree angle. I can intensify the stretch with the strap since I cant reach my feet. I then lower my leg out to the side. Without the strap its very difficult to get a good stretch with good alignment. With the strap I get a wonderful stretch and love holding it for a minute to really get the most out of it.",This helps add some tension to my stretches.,1441670400,{'Color:': ' A - Green/Black - 10 Loops'},7.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OZCJnrSJL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n5yI49lgL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FUlc-BhaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kSMKOMztL._SY88.jpg']",know product plastic maximize thoroughly ease use foot work longer raise way nicely alignment like come thought lean recommend depend quality/price compact add usually product expensive function reality pose problem tight get favorite reach bulkier towards anyone due pad stitch seem take roll big something slightly intensify hamstring roll different hand muscle yoga cow pain daily ability stretch well although long leave put little thing enjoy really bag one toe face love touch lot change pull exhale back quality increase slowly arm right angle try help foot mention hold good nicer stretch price update minute almost cant highly test flexibility would give top sometimes degree everything concern bad pose bearing still see ground strap easily roll lay purpose hamstring send forward difficult fold breathe side reach rating case stretch touch piece around since overall two workout without tension look excellent strap run leg behind gently wonderful there's closely flat stay toe loop well loop allow legs do another reclining stretch/seated low store review

While it definitely ""mounts"" the Nebo 5077 (although for some reason after my purchase, 5077's are nowhere to be found??) and is a perfect fit for both the tac light and my Moss 88 tube, I have a few concerns.  First some good stuff. Only took 30 seconds to install. Very light weight but VERY tough exterior and comfy rubber interior. The foot print doesn't mess up the sling because you can adjust the mount like 35 degrees to the left and you're good. Secures your light enough to where nothing will come off on it's own. Fits Nebo 5077 perfectly. Also, Nebo 5077's are awesome (if you can find one..), impossibly affordable with amazing quality. Anyway moving on.  Some sadly kind of stuff that didn't quite meet my probably weird expectations.  I feel like there is a disparity between the ability for this to mount, and mount securely. It can mount, don't get me wrong. And it won't fall off, but anything past that leaves me curious. Basically this won't turn your tac light into any kind of breach tool, ""DNA remover,"" or impromptu cover gripping mechanism as secure like a truly fixed mount would.  I didn't even want to fully tighten it as I was afraid any tighter and it was going to strip out the threads. Whether it would or not I don't know but I wasn't going to tighten it anymore than it comfortably wanted to go. As tight as it would go it is loose enough to move around by hand axially, but tight enough to not move on it's own laterally. Any pressure whatsoever though will flex it about 35 degrees laterally.  Here's the thing though. It did mount my Nebo 5077 so I'm not mad at it. It didn't meet all of my expectations but usually my expectations are all messed up anyway. I now have an affordable, and surprisingly cost-effective tac light mounted secure enough to where it won't come off by itself.  Bottom line. If you have absolutely NOTHING, and don't know what to do. Get yourself a Nebo 5598 mount and a Nebo 5077 tac light and then worry about the rest later.  Edit. I had to bump my score up. This mount held together when my heat shield came off (needs thermal tape), and my sling reflex bounced itself off (needed to be attached in reverse), and my tube started unscrewing (needs lock-tight). So this thing absolutely secures my light to my tube and the locking mechanism is just fine, although I have it super tight to the point to where I'm worried it'll break, strip itself, or crush the tube (heh) but it's held no problem so that's probably how tight it's supposed to be. Granted again I don't retract my statement that it isn't as secure as a production job. You can't use this as a defense tool or to brace against a surface. It's *only* for mounting your flashlight.  Also mount it at a 45 degree angle clockwise or the recoil will bump it into your knuckles.

I went on an 8-day trekking trip and didn't think I'd really need them, so I didn't want to spend much money on them. Turns out I used them every day and they were a life saver! They got me through the trip. That's why I gave them 3 starts. However, they are poorly constructed and many times I had trouble keeping one pole or the other locked, so when I went to put weight on it, the pole would collapse, therefore rendering itself useless (I'm 5'2 and 115 lb, so it wasn't much weight). My boyfriend could usually get it to stay after a while, but it was time consuming, irritating, unreliable, and I'm not sure I could have gotten them to function on my own.

I went with this holster because I had the Blackhawk CQC, but I didn't have a lot of carry time with it. If I did, I probably wouldn't have bought this level 2 duty holster since it has the same safety. I liked this holster at first. It protected my gun from things bumping into the slide. Especially near the rear sights.  It wasn't up until around my employment of 13 months I noticed something strange on the trigger guard of my Glock 17 gen 4. On the right side of the trigger guard were deep scratches in the polymer. At first I thought it was caused by dirt getting into the holster. It wasn't. My second suspicion was the inside of the holster. So that was smoothed down with 200 grit sand paper. I  also sanded this one side of the trigger guard that had the deep scratches to see if when I put the gun back in if the scratches would reappear. They did.  I then found the problem. It was the index finger release safety that was cutting deep scratches into the polymer trigger guard of my Glock 17. When the gun slides into the holster, the trigger guard pushes the safety out of the way in order to fully sit and locked into the holster. I tried changing the angle of the safety to prevent these deep scratches, but it didn't do much. I then tried pressing in the safety release with my trigger finger as I was holstering. This helped somewhat, but I didn't like to do every time I went to holster my gun.  I eventually looked at some of the guns that the rest of my coworkers had. They too had the same blackhawk holster, and they too had these deep scratches or worn areas of the trigger guard on there glock 19's or 17's.

Since I bought a crossbow pistol some time ago assembly this crossbow rifle was easy, but I will list things you should know after my general comment.  If you have never owned a crossbow and want to try one, this is a good choice.  Hunting grade crossbows are $350 to $1,000+.  This is a Target Grade Crossbow, but it is not a toy.  Power is not specified, but I would guess it is at least an 80 pounder.  It is very accurate at 10 yards and will sink darts into targets at 20 yards. If aimed high, the darts will travel much farther. The bow subassembly is already stung which is a blessing.  The included 4X20mm Scope (which does come with instructions) is real plus.  Getting Started:  Right out of the box every screw, nut and bolt should be checked for snug fit.  My guess is that most of the negative comments from others about early failures were because of loose fasteners.  Also, after each shooting session, all should be rechecked.  Tightening everything before attaching the bow subassembly and scope makes the tightening process much easier.  Assembly:  The heavy `U' shaped bar on the crossbow goes on the bottom of the crossbow `barrel' and the single cable on top.  Before you attach it to the stock, tighten the two bold and nuts which hold the bow together.  A screwdriver and a small adjustable wrench are required for all nuts and bolts. Then tighten the bolt and nut holding on the front sight.  Then tighten the three bolts and nuts that hold the main frame together.  Now the bow can be attached.  Once in place, locate the large washer on the front of the bow and insert the large hex bolt through it.  Tighten with the provided Hex Allen Wrench.  My crossbow came with an extra bow bolt and Allen Wrench.  If yours does too, just save them.  Only one main bolt is required to attach the bow.  Prior to attaching the telescopic sight, the rear standard one must be removed.  This is easy but don't stop there.  Remove the silver screw on the rail which held the old rear sight.  Then remove the long bolt sticking up from it which is left over from the original sight.  It will interfere with the scope.  The shorter bolt on the front of the rail will not.  It is required to hold the dart retainer spring.  Leave the short bolt in place.  Removing the sight mounting rail will also give you access to moving metal parts which hold and release the bow cable. Give these a very light spray with aerosol gun oil or penetrating oil.  Only a quick shot on each pivot is all that is required.  Wipe up the excess.  Any overspray will drip out the bottom of the trigger assembly lubricating it along the way.  Lightly oiling the bow spools is also a good thing to do. They are under a lot of pressure.  Spray some oil on a towel and wipe the bow cable and the rails it slides on.  Also, wipe the insides of the rails that that the two cocking rods slide in.  Reattach the sight rail and mount the scope.  One adjustment knob must point up and the other must face right.  After shooting 10 darts you will see if scope adjustments need to be made. If your darts are grouped too low or high, unscrew the cap on the top adjuster and use a screwdriver to set up or down.  If your shots are right or left, do the same with right facing adjustor.  At first try about  turn.  Again fire 10 darts.  If still more adjustment is required give the screw(s) a 1/8 turn and fire another 10 darts.  If your shots are now evenly grouped around the bull's-eye you are done.  Screw the cover caps on and you are good to go.  If not, keep making adjustments at 1/8 turns.  If you over adjust, turn the screw(s) back slightly.  The scope also has a focus adjustment.  If you loosen the ring at the front of the rear eyepiece you can screw the lens in or out for a sharp focus.  About  way worked best for me.  When sighting, do not put your eye against the scope.  2 to 3 inches behind protects your eye from firing vibration and gives the best view.  When you are at the correct distance you will see the crosshairs in a fully lit circle.  Cocking:  The cocking system in normally locked. To release it, put you hand on the stock handle (not the pistol grip) and press the release button with your thumb. It is located where the trigger would be on a conventional rifle.  Pressing the release, continue holding the stock and with your other hand holding the horn on the front of the crossbow pull the stock down until you hear and see the cable lock in place.  Relock the stock back in its normal position.  I find it easiest to place the stock against my waist when cocking.  It makes the process very easy.  Once cocked, activate the safety switch DOWN.  It is a flipper on the left side of the crossbow at the top of the pistol grip.  UP is fire mode.  Loading:  After cocking, make sure the safety is activated and just in case, never touch the trigger when loading.  Place the dart with the `feathers' pointing right and left.  Slide the dart underneath the spring clip all the way back until it contacts the stop.  Unlike a conventional arrow, there is no groove to be slipped over a string. There will be a small gap behind the stop to allow the cable to pop up and engage the dart properly.  Shooting:  Once on target, release the safety.  Wrap your other hand around your trigger hand as if you were shooting a pistol.  Placing a hand underneath the crossbow can and will result in skin burns as the bottom cables travel forward.  If your archery target is soft or worn you may need to add two or tree layers of cardboard to keep the dart from sinking all the way in it.  As I previously mentioned, this is not a toy.  Warnings:  Always wear Eye Protection.  Do NOT place your other hand underneath the crossbow when shooting.  Activate the safety switch before loading a dart.  The dart must be properly loaded or harmful misfires can occur.  Only release the safety when you are on target.  Never air higher than the sights indicate.  Make sure the area behind your target is clear in case of a miss.  AND, you may find crossbow shooting addictive.  : )",Excellent Value,1361750400,,,,power evenly go vibration mount allen come protection thumb wipe slip inch try aerosol insert silver thing allow press sure spool make stop subassembly eyepiece trigger waist star misfire position turn original feather check right layer point pull nut barrel slide easier spring target high miss would metal comment telescopic hear everything ago sight leave adjustment remove release pistol tighten crossbow main plus prior process bow set two bull's-eye sink wrench comment system frame eye shape previously go knob washer do remove loose loosen place every may protect small know give specify stung yard locate negative bold cap much view button fastener burn drip extra rear start come turn guess fire archery hold normal normally clip gun rail target failure long ring lock pounder one make point string contact hold spray own give conventional instruction load access accurate dart first time top retainer general also lens pressure still shorter see five bottom hex excess rifle rechecked side adjustment screwdriver case engage choice sight since require correct old penetrating reattach interfere behind attach snug slide adjust heavy always three save lock give clear bless held cable assembly use hand fire lit activate cardboard travel dart need others nut area least crosshairs circle tighten lightly stick slightly cable groove must box left pivot thing grade face scope lot back place remove distance crossbow addictive low good single quick worn fit easy early safety arrow result focus gap hunt part towel standard horn overspray cock attach front bought provide make adjustable warning oil continue best move along attach screw session oil another relock aim rail air pop group find shot way inside load skin add properly wrap far shoot press wear soft high mode already bar indicate real handle unlike put shot include touch activate underneath sharp flipper mention harmful face large work tree together list want light fully switch bolt sight screw(s sink easy locate except cap forward cock unscrew never short adjustor mount stock around occur cover adjuster make bolt rod get toy keep grip lubricating

At that time of the morning in Pittsburgh its either chilly or downright cold so I needed gear that I could go out in but that would stay comfortable as I warmed up and throughout the time I was running. The Jarseen Sport Pants are absolutely perfect not only for running any time of the day in any season, but also for EVERYTHING. These are hands-down the most comfortable pants that I own. Ive worn these while Ive run, while Ive biked, while Ive lounged on the couch binge watching The Walking Dead, and while Ive grocery shopped.  The Jarseen tights are wonderfully-made well-fitting athletic leggings. The pants start with a 3.5 inch waist band that stays put and never rolls or bunches. There is a thin corded drawstring at the mid-point of the waist band that can be removed or kept in depending on your preference. The nylon-spandex blend material is durable, smooth, and form fitting without being constricting. Contrast stitching and net patch design details make these astonishingly flattering and sporty. They are machine washable and they tumble dry fast  Ive washed and dried them more than 10 times since I received them and they still look great. Sizing is exactly what I expected. Im 53 and around 145 (the binge watching/couch thing happens more frequently than the run/bike thing) and I ordered these in the XL. Because of the spandex and the give of the nylon the fit is perfect, I may have been able to go down a size or two but Im not sure there would have been any benefit, they just could not get any more comfortable than they are. They stretch to fit when you pull them on but laid flat, after being washed and dried multiple times, the measurements of the XL are: Length  34 inches Across the front of the top of the waist  13.5 inches Across the front at the hip  17 inches At the ankle seam straight across  4 inches  Quality is exceptional, all stitching is tight, straight and even, the fabric is flawless, and the design is sporty and flattering.

Normal bath towels scrub and rub and buff you completely dry. They don't stick to you. You have to press them on your body. (Think: ""He-heee that tickles! OK, let's put on some clothes!"")  This is not the DryLite experience. At its best, in drier air, the DryLite feels like buffing yourself with super-lightweight suede leather. At its worst, in a really humid steamy shower room, it feels like a clingy micro-sued cloth that gets damp and grabs and skids over your wet skin until you peel it off. In both cases it feels like your skin air dries a moment after the towel is removed. This is highly effective but sort of unsettling until you mentally adjust to the wet-suede-rubbing feeling. (Think: ""Wait was I just licked by a moist calf tongue or...? Oh hey, I'm dry!"")  While I would never admit to my girlfriend that I actually like that sensation, and I'm not sure that I do, I can completely justify paying good money for an approximately 2-foot by 4-foot towel that I can dunk completely under water, wring out well, hang dry and pack in 45 minutes. I'm 6' 210 average body type, and I can wrap it around my waist and change my clothes underneath.

1649,2011678,5,True,"03 13, 2015",AHQ0KIP330AVX,B00R1JC894,Andy Christ,"Only had this bicycle lamp for tens days now, but have tested it out as extensively as weather has permitted and am quite pleased. Ordered this Nitefighter because it was the first multi-lens model to come with Cree's Neutral White XP-G2. Earth tones along the trail don't get bleached out, so natural elements such as branches, dry leaves, mud and rock are more recognizable, and obstacles more avoidable. Can't overstate this quality; have always found the Cool White tint of my previously owned bike lights rather disorienting, kinda mimicked intense moon or star light. Hours of pedaling through what appeared to be dreamscape would make me want to close my eyes and drift off to slumberland... not such a good thing to happen when riding a bike. Neutral White, OTOH, being closer to natural afternoon or morning light, keeps me feeling more alert and involved with my surroundings. It's a much happier experience over all.  As it is still winter here, my night rides so far have not exceeded much more than about an hour and a half, the BT40S powered anywhere from Low to Turbo. From a full charge on the included battery, the indicator has only dropped from green to blue near my return home, meaning there is still up to 75% remaining. This is better performance than I've had from any other setup, so no complaints here.  Was pleasantly unsurprised by the shape and scope of the NiteFighter BT40S' beam pattern. Despite its relatively wide angle, the throw from this thing's four (count 'em, four) emitters is pretty darsh darn good. Maybe doesn't reach quite as far as would a longer, reflector based spot light, but has much smoother and even distribution. There's no ringing or wasted spill; light fades gradually from the center without distict boarders. Haven't unscrewed the front bezel yet to swap in the extra-wide angle diffusing lens that's included in the package (because the default lens has been fine for all my needs so far) but expect that option would benefit more from an auxiliary little spot lamp you could mount on your helmet. NiteFighter has actually come up with a NW single emitter specifically lamp designed to complement the BT40S, might be a worthwhile addition for anyone who actually installs the diffuser and/or rides real technical track.  Doesn't look like the manufacturer cut any corners here, and the results speak for themselves. BT40S is extremely easy to operate, even with heavy gloves on. Brightness is adjustable through four levels in either direction without having to cycle through Off, with the aid of a large soft-touch dual control button. One criticism: Low mode, at 30% power, still seems kinda high to me. Seeing as there are four levels, think maybe it could have started off at 20% or 25%, with more discernible differences between each press of the button. But that's just me, am sure others will appreciate the subtlety. Couple of bonus features not declared in the Amazon overview: Charge indicator LEDs remains unlit when the lamp is not in use, so the battery pack can remain connected without draining any power. And the two-whole-Amp charger gently flashes red near end of its cycle before going green once the cells have reached 8.4V - 8.5V.  Like that there is a soft connection from the cell pack to the charger cable and a firmer, waterproof connection to the lamp head. Very well though out and implemented design.

There was probably at least enough room for another queen. 2) very easy to setup (note, if the arc tent pole doesn't quite fit, you have it in the wrong sleeve :) ) To make life simpler you should have a second person for the last 5 minutes of setup to help stand up the arcs. You will only need the instructions once. Be aware of the state of the red ""markers"" on the center poles. They appear to be tape and will wear off. May need to find a more permanent ""red marker"". 3) door in front and back 4) pretty good ventilation with tarp on. 5) not as bulk folded up as you would think 6) only really needed 4 stakes (I bought 8 heavy duty) during the dry season. 2 more for the fly during rainy season.  Cons: 1) material is the same basic material that most tents are made out of. I was kind of expecting something more bulky 2) The bag that the tent came in came ripped. 3) getting it back in the back (without getting everything all dirty, dratted light colors) was difficult 4) It barely fit in the campsite though (but that is my problem). 5) If you think that the ""cabin"" door will close it self, it won't.

Although there are a lot of reviews, because i've now had it for over two years i feel i can contribute something new.  Let me start by saying it is an extremely useful piece of equipment for a utility biker. It's not much use for touring or for use on ""poodle bikes"" (not that you'd find a rear rack on a skinny-tired carbon racer, anyway), but for those who view a bike as a mode of transportation, this is an essential tool. Here's my input, take it for what it's worth.  Pros: * very well-built with strong stitching and zippers. I have loaded the panniers and top compartment so heavily several times that i was sure the zippers or seams were going to break, but it's all still as good as new to my eye after a couple years of use and abuse. * very fast and easy to attach and remove from the bike if you have one of the DX Topeak racks * good space; with the fold-down panniers, it can be a stellar grocery-getter or laundry day lugger * useful water bottle pocket and rear blinky loop * attractive design (for what it is it looks pretty classy) * well-insulated and relatively waterproof  Cons: * the expansion top is a gimmick i could do without. It's not that i don't sometimes use the space, it's that i'm constantly grabbing the wrong zipper pull (the one that unzips the expansion rather than the one that opens the top) and don't see it as a problem to have the expansion permanently. I'd rather not have the extra weight and complexity. * the shock cord web and mesh pocket on top isn't very useful as-is. The handle itself gets in the way of using the top for serious storage. This leads us to... * the top handle is sooo poorly placed! Because it's attached to the top of the bag, it only works when the bag is zipped closed, making it very awkward to carry and use (e.g. in a store). It's also a good thing the zippers are strong or they would break from the stress when carrying it loaded.  The first con could be resolved if Topeak just made the bag a couple inches higher all around to yield about the same volume as when ""expanded"", and leave it at that.  The last two points could both be resolved by attaching the two webbing handles slightly further apart, to the top edges of the bag instead of the top flap. This would both facilitate putting a load on top of the bag (using the mesh or shock cord to secure it) and allow the bag to be carried when open or closed and also not put strain on the zipper.  To conclude, this is a fantastic bag with a few flaws. I highly recommend it to anyone with a DX rear rack who ever carries things on their bike. A lady at a garden party i biked to asked about it and mentioned she had trouble carrying her groceries in her basket. When i showed her the zip-out panniers, it blew her mind.  Update 12/2014:  After about three more years of almost daily use and abuse, my MTX bag is on its last legs. What really did it in was an accident that left me with a broken collarbone. The bag was filled with heavy items at the time, and it tore out some of the stitching in the panniers. I resewed the panniers, but a bigger problem is that the expansion on top (that I already commented on above) has separated from the top zipper in a way that can't really be fixed, so now I have to keep the expansion zipper closed at all times in order to use the handle. The stitching on the zippers and the handles is also coming out due to the weight from carrying it around (again I refer you to my comment above about the handles being attached to the top flap rather than the bag itself). All of this would be avoided if the handles were attached to the sides of the bag rather than the top flap. It's a real design flaw.  Another abuse the bag has endured is that I have a couple of times failed to slide it on far enough to engage the clip at the end, only to have it slide off while biking or carrying the bike up the stairs and plop unceremoniously on the ground. That probably hasn't helped any with the preservation. Carrying 20# bags of drywall compound in each pocket probably doesn't help, either.  I have to recant about the lack of value of the shock cords on top and as a drawstring around the water bottle holder. The one that forms a cargo net i regularly use to hold the bag open while i rummage inside... i just hook the loop around the nose of the saddle. It's very convenient. Also, you can use a combination of the two to secure long bottles or loads that stick out of the back of the top compartment (e.g. 2 liter soda bottle).  In spite of its flaws, this is a truly sturdy and useful product and I will buy another of the same model when it finally gives up the ghost.",Eminently Useful,1329782400,{'Size:': ' 36 x 25 x 21.5~29 cm'},,,"poorly i've shortly ever rack grocery-getter attractive inch permanently resolve time last poodle fold-down point racer stitch thing allow bicycle buying sure accident make preservation trunk compartment really well-built zip hook separate bike let pull far shock couple saddle big load as-is high almost highly flaws sale carry would comment tubular topeak bottle carry work zipper finally water leave remove lead lugger volume either broken constantly stick pocket two without refer eye essential resew rei holder stellar contribute fix awkward utility much view open value blow extra rear abuse could blinky e.g bike product useful open garden hold apart can't clip unzips dx several due problem trouble ask serious daily place long one new make relatively give gimmick load worth skinny-tired first item classy weight cord help time strain top buy also plop still anyway see edge inside year secure bags side put engage complexity zipper comment attach slide heavy fill use three rather ghost expand seam use break extremely order facilitate recommend flap say recant convenient carry pro the&nbsp;<a anyone enough i'd take slightly form yield rummage although cord leave thing help waterproof rack lot back endure spite wrong good stress bike side laundry design unceremoniously mind basket sometimes tour start attach drywall fast cargo class=""a-link-normal heavily buy piece i'm combination equipment attach come compound flaw con mesh loop tourist another strong get lady biking look conclude collarbone bar</a>&nbsp;for drawstring storage find grabbing way model space load sooo bottle zip-out mtx show tore closed mode sturdy expansion con something already feel real net liter handle put nose tool bag input here's webbing mention go probably soda stair truly transportation lack super grocery update fail biker fantastic well-insulated ground data-hook=""product-link-linked easy day whim avoid review around carbon instead end party handle web regularly legs pannier carry keep store pretty"

It's not a messenger bag. It's not a backpack. It's not a regular shoulder bag. What it does do it hang on the right hip pretty well -- though not perfectly, as it does flap and move a bit. It's asymmetrical, which means that it only fits on one hip and not the other.   Size: It's not a huge bag, more of a ""man purse"" sized bag. Electrician tools would certainly fit in here, as would fishing gear. You could use this as a concealed carry or range bag, too.   Comfort: If you like shoulder bags, this one is pretty comfortable. The should pad could be more solid, in my opinion, and the crazy thing about the bag is that it doesn't always stay on that hip. This is kind of annoying.   Construction: Definitely well made. No doubt about that. Zippers don't catch and seams are all sturdy.  Really my one negative on this bag is that it flops around a bit too much for my taste. As I mention in my video, I kind of wish it had a waist strap to keep it tightly in place. It does, however, have a lot going for it -- including the price.

It's durable and appealing to the eye and is perfect for the wet soggy grass at the parks so you don't end up with a wet bottom. This blanket is perfect for the beach since it's so light to carry when folded into it carrying case and the excess water can easily be shaken off.

1893,2434592,5,False,"06 23, 2016",AOIIPYKC63YX,B01ECATQ1W,K. LeCrone,"I am trying to up my exercise and physical activity and get back into more regular walking and jogging, and while I already own a number of waist packs and running belts that fits my iPhone 6 Plus, I was interested in looking into new options that would also fit water bottles so that I don't have to carry it in my hand while I'm out and about. While I already owned two that suited water bottles, this one was easily more accommodating all-around.  This particular waist pack by ErgaLogik is extremely well made, and fit just fine around my waist and over my hips, and more padding than many others I've owned over the years. The rear side has secure snap closure and one area that can be adjusted to shorten or length the belt. Because it only has one adjustment strap rather than two, you're not able to further center the forward portion of the bag.  While the product listing doesn't specify what material the bag is made out of beyond being made of water resistant materials, many of the colored and grey sections of the bag appear to be made out of nylon, and also has some mesh sections for ventilation. I purchased the ""Aqua Blue"" color of this bag, which has predominantly teal-blue colors with silver-grey accents, zippers, mesh, and a small silver section that is reflective for safety. It is 7.5 x 2 x 6 inches large and 6.4 ounces in weight.  I really appreciated how many compartments there were. There's little worse than being limited to a few compartments and cringing as you toss your keys into the same compartment as your phone and hope for the best.  This particular bag offers five compartments:  - A large zippered compartment on the left which is large enough to fit my iPhone 6 Plus and case either vertically or horizontally. - A smaller mesh pouch inside of this compartment that fit my keys easily. - A medium zippered section on the front of this compartment that easily fit my wallet. - A slot for a water bottle with a tension tie. - A small zippered mesh compartment between the water bottle section and the padding on the back of the bag. I was able to fit some credit cards in this section.  One note here is that only three of these sections could be consider fully enclosed and potentially water resistant.  I was able to put my 17 ounce insulated stainless steel water bottle in the water bottle slot with room to spare, so I feel you could accommodate a larger water bottle or canteen in there without any issues. Your own mileage may vary, but do keep in mind that you will need to supply your own water bottle. One feature I really liked was that the bottle wasn't in the way of my hands/arms when jogging and felt nicely weighted.  All in all, I think it's a great waist pack, and it's easily become my favorite waist pack I own! I feel I'll get a lot of good use out of it this summer, and I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in a solid pack for your own adventures.

Plus, it's eco-friendly, recyclable, leak free, dishwasher safe, microwave safe and even freezer safe!

Made a couple stupid mistakes the first time out, but I also inflated it at the launch site, put it in and headed up the river.  Most of the time I will use it by myself, but did take a friend with me. It had way more room than I anticipated. As long as you shove the back seat as far back as you can, it will gain you a few extra inches. Just slightly punch each side back and forth and it does go back further than just pushing it together with 2 hands. (hard to explain, but made a big difference). The heights of the 2 of us was 59 and 56. We were both comfortable.  Love the pro seats. Really comfortable. Dont feel like Kayak seats. Great support and I didn't even use the blue support straps (because I didn't look closely at the instructions). The only down side to these seats is that it takes a lot longer to dry, but easy to take inside the condo (I live in a high-rise) to re-inflate and fully let the canvas dry. I still wouldnt go with the lighter weight deluxe ones  The double inflate valves makes it inflate and deflate really fast. I didn't need to use the pump. Once you unscrew the lower valve the air comes right out. You just have to really catch the water that is trapped all the way in the bow and particularly the stern. Still easy to dry to put away.  I wish it came with bungy cords across the bow to stow things like a life jacket if its in a place thats not mandatory to wear but I can probably come up with something to make it work.  Regardless this is a great Kayak in all ways. Cant wait to see the fall colors change next month.  I would suggest that if you are deflating it in a grassy area that you put it on a plastic tarp. It makes it easier so that you don't have to continually dry off the grass thats stuck to it because it was wet. Use camping chamois towels to dry it off.

I tried contacting the company directly (following the packaging instructions), but the email address was undeliverable.  If you thought this pack was too good to be true, you were right.

It holds my FULL SIZE pistols in place very nicely and has slots for 2 magazines each (and obviously a third in the magazine well if you so choose). The downsides are not a big deal to me, but may be of interest to others, so: 1. Does not hold revolvers (I believe it says that in the description too) 2. Some compacts MIGHT fit, but none of mine do. They fall forward into the slot where the barrels on full size pistols sit. They still ultimately remain stationary and will be there when you open the case, they will just get bounced around a lot in transit. Wouldn't even try subcompacts. 3. The storage space in the center, as you can observe from the photos, is not very large. I tried to place my range rounds in there but unfortunately most of the boxes did not fit. Definitely mainly for eye pro, ear pro, and extra mags. However, I did fit my 6"" Chiappa rhino in there with room to spare.

2052,812033,5,True,"12 28, 2012",AGNKQDJG9VVQ2,B001WJ59BI,Mark T.,This Bipod fits perfect on my Ruger 10 22 barrel. On the top side of the bipod there is a spring loaded durable metal clip which you push to release the clamp. Inside the clamp there is some black padding that is installed into the bipod clamp that helps extremely well to protect the barrel. The padding is not noticeable at all when you clamp the bipod on the barrel and the barrel does not touch any part of the metal on the bipod. In the picture there is a screw that hangs down and a round metal wheel which sits horizontal. When you clamp the bipod on your barrel you turn the horizontal wheel which tightens the bipod on the barrel. This is all you have do to install the bipod. When the bipod is clamped on it's really SOLID and not flimsy or wobbly at all. When you twist the lower extension screws on the bipod legs there is an internal loaded spring that allows the legs to pop right out which gives you about three more inches of height. On the end of the legs there are rubber feet which are durable. The two pins in the middle of the bipod are also spring loaded. You pull up on the pins and can easily fold up the bipod legs. The bipod feels well made and is all metal (other than feet). When I tested the bipod at the range it stayed put forward and back on the barrel however it does turn left and right when you put some moderate pressure by twisting the stock. This motion did NOT scratch the barrel (NOT AT ALL) because of the inner pads installed on the bipod. The twisting motion was not an issue at all and was even a plus at shooting at odd angles. Overall the bipod fits great and stays put. I put hundreds of rounds through my 10 22 and was very satisfied with this bipod.

Sedentary reminder, pedometer, calculator to name a few.  In terms of use my only experience revolves around use with Android. iPhone as I have read does not work as well.  I have to say I do not like the app suggested and I do not use the app suggested. I have several watches pretty much just like this one but ever so slightly different and ALL of them so far work great with the app I prefer.  I'd suggest using the free Android app SmartWear, to me it is much better than BTNotice or BTNotification. I tried them and I really did not have much luck. Sometimes with some features I got an error that basically told me to install the BT app which I had already done. I set out to find a better app and when I used the first smartwatch I tried about 4-5 apps and settled on using SmartWear. Very easy app to setup and use and now I can use the watch for much more.  View messages, alerts for emails, even weather alerts are possible. If I click a link in a text to a video the video plays on the phone but audio comes from the watch. Phone calls can be made or taken with the watch, just keep in mind the speaker is tiny but loud enough the conversation will be public.  A great deal of what it does is determined by the user and how it is setup. For the price it is a nice option and the worst part in my opinon is the app and the lack of the watch to handle water.  You do not want to get this wet, sweat MIGHT be a problem but I cannot say with any certainty.  The touchscreen is sensitive and the watch very quick and responsive. Navigation is pretty easy after a little time spent with the watch,  The battery life for me manages about 2 days. Recharge times are pretty quick, depending on how depleted the battery you can expect 1-3 hours or so for charging times.  Strong bluetooth, I was able to go at least 20 feet and I still got notifications without issue.  Hopefully the video helps offer some ideas what to expect from the watch, don't think you've got an Apple watch or a Pebble and you'll likely find it is pretty useful and fun to use.

For everyday carry it'll be a great addition to my rotation.  And it's a great size for slipping unobtrusively into your pocket.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the problem mine had with the locking assembly.  The knife opened easily but once it locked, it was almost impossible to release the blade to close it.  I had to initially press on the lock release with a piece wood as my thumb wasn't tough enough to get the blade to unlock.  I ended up having to work on the cam with a small file before I could finally get the blade to release using my thumb, and it's still hard to release though it's starting to loosen up a bit.  Out of the box it was simply impossible to release the locked blade using one's thumb.  So while I really like the knife, it did require some effort on my part to bring it to an operational level.

2321,2349547,5,False,"02 19, 2016",A2E2SU4HELG9FJ,B019X9BXI6,AirHeadReviews,"We had been looking for a good microfiber towel to use while swimming, camping and even keeping in the truck for spare purposes. My spouse is very picky when it comes to microfiber products as they cannot stand how most microfiber clings to the skin or feels like tiny needles on dry skin. So it has been a hard venture to find a good microfiber towel I must admit. Until this microfiber towel from Super Maneuver came around.  When first opening the package one is greeted to a nice soft gray mesh bag that holds the towel and comes with a draw string zip to keep the bag closed. When closed with the microfiber towel included, the entire item is 6"" tall (including the zip) and just shy of 2.5"" in diameter. To give a mental picture, the size of a soda can with just a bit more height. On the front of the bag is a Super Maneuver logo patch done in tasteful non vibrant colors. Sewn into the seam of the mesh bag is a small white tag that reads on one side, ""LIVE IT UP"", and on the other side ""SOAK IT IN"". This is a nice touch as motivation. There is also a cardboard tag that gives tips on care and other instructions that is attached to the mesh bag.  Once opening the bag and removing and unrolling the towel. One finds a nice THANK YOU card rolled within the towel that also has instructions on how to get a 15% off coupon code. Two corners of the towel opposite each other both contain a hanging hook, one of which has care and washing instructions printed on the reverse side. Nice touch of leaving a scratchy label off of the product. Both hooks are snaps that swivel so the towel does not bunch up. Just make sure you pull on the side of the hook that has the curved arrow to undo the snap. The towel is bordered in white soft thread that is X stitched to ensure no frayed ends or tears. The edging is beefed up way more than expected, but is not bulky, thick nor bothersome to the microfiber towels use. The towels dimensions are 20"" wide by 39.25"" long. To give an idea of this size, holding the towel up in front of me at the neck, it resembles the width and length of a kitchen apron. Testing the towel in water it does fully absorb the first time, unlike other microfiber towels as well as rings out with not much stress to the hands. Even upon ringing out, the towel still easily lays flat and does not crinkle up like a cotton t-shirt. Drying time is reasonable for this size and thickness of microfiber towel.  This towel would be great for the beach, gym, yoga or exercise class, as a camping towel, even a bath towel for a child or anything else you can imagine. As it is an all around nice quality microfiber towel and we would easily recommend this product to our friends, family and co-workers. You won't be sorry that you picked one up today.  We received this product for a discounted price or free to give an honest opinion of this product to assist others with their purchase. We believe it is important to give an honest and accurate review to assist others to make good purchasing decisions that can benefit their household.

Modest price and one of the faster triggers for this price point. I really like the NO Glow - doesn't warn people or alarm animals. They work a long time on batteries even in cold weather tho we haven't had real cold weather to truly test them (like down to -30f). But they have performed well down to 0 to 10F and batteries (energizer lithiums) last a long time if there aren't tons of photos taken.  I have set them at trapping sites to see what's going on and some other places just for fun as well as surveillance of my property.  I'll include a few photos that are fun. Oh and work pretty good at night but not as long range - which is to be expected. If batteries are low and its cold its night time performance is really reduced. UPDATE 11-5-17: We now have 6 of these cameras. Most run really well tho they really do best with the energize lithiums - sure wish Amazon would ship THOSE to me.  Out latest camera worked well until a rain/snow storm hit and we can't get it to run. The maker has offered some suggestions but nothing has worked so far - darn n too late for an Amazon refund.

Forget buying multiple grippers at $15-$25 a piece (one for warm up and buying new ones as you get stronger), this in the only gripper you'll ever need.  The best part about it is how many incremental weight settings it has. The typical 50 lbs jump for each standard gripper is a little excessive but this gripper lets you go up in ~12 lbs increments.  The product itself looks great and is built as solid as can be.  You won't regret buying this gripper!  A big difference of this gripper vs others is that standard grippers have an uneven pull throughout the motion; it's easy at first and only really gets to its full resistance within an inch of a full close.  The Vatiz gripper has even resistance throughout the entire pull.  With a standard gripper, the bottoms of the handles will touch but there will be space along the rest of the handles that increases toward the top.

The only thing that this holster is anything but excellent is the break in period.  First thing, the strap that holds the gun in place.

Let a friend test my bike out and he loved them, wants to now buy a set and upgrade to disc instead of V-brakes.  When first using them they were a bit annoying from a squeaking noise. Just took some rides and use of the brakes until that squeaking stopped, guess the pads and rotors just needed to get worn in. Not hard to install and get fine tuned and keep tuned for tight braking, the adjuster dials are easy to use to do that with. Since the brakes are more centered on your rims instead of at the top like rim brakes you do loose some force or feeling that you might flip your bike if braking to hard with the front. (personally I prefer using front brakes over rear unless steering and braking around a turn on a dirt trail).  Been using them for a year now. Changed the pads one time a few months ago and around ounce a month its simple to keep the brakes tight by turning the inner or outer sometimes both just one click.

The spoon is a decent size and its very nice to have a napkin and wet wipe included so you can maintain some sense of civilization about you.

That's a lot to lug around if you're on an extended backpacking trip. All the packaging is about 25% of the total weight, so it is possible to reduce the overall weight by discarding the outer envelope and some of the individual item overwraps.

The new FRH, which you put the entree inside of after activation, DOES work.

These are made of a fairly substantial fabric with a dense weave that does not stretch thin and become overly revealing.  Additionally, they seem pretty sturdy, are attractively cut (the bootcut is fairly narrow and slimming) and they have a tasteful, tone-on-tone design that gives them a bit of a unique flair.

Mostly because they were tools and I didn't mind throwing them away if I broke them. (ok and also because I was on a budget:) My favorite knife to this point was my Kabar and my cold steel recon one half serrated folder. I have had the folder for 17 years and just broke the tip the other day. Decided to step into the $100 and beyond folding knives for my replacement now that I am retired and make more money. I was skeptical because the HK  (Koch is pronounced coke btw) was going to replace my old trusted and true knife which has seen me through three wars and was as dependable as they come. Well the HK arrived yesterday and I was really impressed whn I pulled it out of the box. Some knives you know right away aren't going to be good, well this one I knew right away Was going to be good. The handle has excellent grip and although it has a slight plastic feel, still feels solid due to metal liners. Blade is responsive and snaps into place quickly and holds securely. I have some cheap open assist knives like the SOG which are Ok but I like the feel of a responsive blade and not having to wonder if today is the day that the spring is going to fail. Good teeth on the serrated edge and I really like the shape of the blade not too fat or skinny. One drawback on a lot of knives is the clip being either too loose or too tight. Well this one was like goldilocks and was just right. I had no problems getting my knife out or putting it back one handed. I am a roof inspector now and wore this one in the rain all day cutting open various items. I have never had a blade move to the number one spot as quickly as this, but the HK is a solid workhorse. If you are on the fence about this knife I would recommend buying it. I also ordered the Benchmade Adamas 275 but at almost double the price that one may be just a defense weapon when it gets here.

2706,550923,5,True,"06 4, 2016",A94WNKR5OWJL,B0014DZQZQ,Dusty Dino,"This powder measure has proven to be quite consistent for me. The main mechanism seems to be a clever design that works well. However, the hopper portion feels like cheap plastic. That's because it is. The plastic hopper portion consists of 4 pieces: hopper ($6), valve ($5), wiper ($1), and the screw that holds it all together ($0.50). Even though it feels quite cheap, I have not had any issues with mine so far. Even if I did, you can see that replacement parts are quite cheap.  This powder measure works by filling a cavity in a disk, hence the name. As you pull the lever on your press, the case rises in to the measure mechanism and through springs and levers, the disk is moved from under the hopper and dumps the powder charge in to a hole over the case. As you lower the lever, the disk cavity move back under the hopper to fill with another charge. The preset disks top out at 1.57cc. If you need more powder than that allows, Lee sells a double disk kit, allowing you to stack disks for greater charges. I have it and it works okay, but I prefer to use a drum style powder measure for larger charges. I also have the adjustable charge bar and I like it a lot. See my review of that for more information.  It is worth noting that you are limited to the preset cavity volumes in the 4 disks provided, unless you're using the adjustable charge bar. One cavity might hold 4 grains of TiteGroup, and the next size might hold 4.5 grains. This is an exact problem that I had, so I drilled and tapped a set screw in the larger cavity. By adjusting the set screw I can dial the charge down to 4.2 grains, my competition load. I've included some photos of the Pro Auto Disk on a turret for 9mm. You can see the set screw I've installed in the disk. I was concerned that it would create a shelf for powder to stand on, but it has not been a problem at all.

Due to the poor quality of the stitching and craftsmanship, I would not recommend this bag or others made by this company.  I bought a Snugpak Rocket Pak and a Snugpak Bergen to see which one I would want to use as an extended bug out bag.  I chose the Bergen as it was larger while not being significantly heavier, and I returned this bag.  The Bergen has better padding in the shoulder straps, and was more comfortable with weight in the bag.  The Bergen also has has load lifter straps to keep the load weight off of the top of the shoulders while this pack doesn't.  Aside from that, the quality on the two packs was very similar.  This pack was built very solid.  All of the seams were double stitched.  One side of each of the main pouches pocket zippers was single stitched.  I would have sewn those with a sewing machine if I would have kept this bag.  All of the trim was also single stitched.

I previously only had battery operated lights on my bike- which, as most know, is not very safe for night riding (which I do almost daily.) My girlfriend picked this batter operated one out to mount to my rear (she had another for my front that was a bit smaller and round.)  The general build of this light is plastic (casing) and silicone band. To 'charge' it with the included USB cable one has to remove the waterproof outlet cover on the back and connect the micro USB charging end. We found that the waterproof plug is very tight and that the wide cable end doesn't connect the easiest. The first few charges it would work its way out and stop charging, then it tore off completely. We had no issues with the charging connection after, but it is obviously no longer waterproof.  Aside from that mishap it has a wonderful array of modes, 2 brightness settings (and the brightest is blinding) and a flashing mode. We are very pleased with how much visibility this offers at night and are thinking of buying another.  We charged it for about 2 hours for the first use then left it on to time it's charge life and got about 25 solid minutes out of it on solid (not flashing) mode. It fastens easily with the rubber notches band and doesn't seem to slide at all during the ride. In all we are very impressed and would love to have more lights from this manufacturer, it is well worth the cost (waterproof seal mishap and all- honestly, I'd just tear that flap off.)  ***Update- The manufacturer reached out regarding my issues with the waterproof tab and have sent me a replacement at no cost.

I started doing research over the following weeks and thought I had decided on getting a strap that you could wrap around the mat.  However, while looking for those and continuing to do classes, I quickly realized that I wanted (needed?) something that allowed me to carry ALL of my ""stuff"" (mat, keys/wallet, towel, etc.).  So I researched some more and came across two Gaiaim bags, including this one.  I absolutely love it.. as other reviewers have said it is big enough to fit my 70+ inch mat and towel.  The larger pouch on the front easily fits my wallet, keys, and phone (but not those things AND a water bottle - which is fine as both of my hands are free with this bag so I can certainly use one to carry a bottle).  The material seems nice and durable.  Now for why I held back on 1 star: 1) they definitely should have used a breakaway clasp for the front pouch instead of the loop de loop closure method.  it's really frustrating to have to go through the finger gymnastics whenever i need to get in there quickly.  2) they should have offered this particular bag (which has the nice big pouch in the front unlike the others) in other colors - or if they couldn't do that, they could have at least made the one color offering one which would hide dirt much better.

My first, the model with the back screen, went blank one day at the gym. No warning at all - such as a low battery. I always keep a spare battery and replaced it at the gym. It started working and then again went blank. I made sure the battery was placed in it correctly - this was not the first I had replaced the battery. Regardless - the unit died. This model was the second I purchased. Worked like a charm until I slightly got it wet - I put my hand under the water (maybe a foot deep for a minute or two).  I was going to take a swim in the pool but the cleaning guy showed up and I had to get out.  When I got out of the pool, The heart rate monitor said weak signal from the chest sensor. I replaced the battery in the chest sensor no change. Then I change the battery in the heart rate monitor and again no change. It was then that the heart rate monitor went blank, it was then again that replaces battery. The heart monitor went blank, showed me an hour glass, reset itself and lost all of its memory.  After replacing battery several times started working but I can no longer read the heart rate monitor or the foot pod that I have.  It seems to me that polar has designed the product I swear on purpose that is so sensitive that it forces you to have to replace it after so many uses for exchanges a battery.

I needed to drink more water at work and wanted to drink less\no sodas, but I like my water really cold.  The machines at work would barely chill water due to constant use.  I found we had ice machines on a couple of floors in the tower, but it was too big of a pain for individual glasses.  The ice is also the very small cubes which melt fast.  I got this and would fill it half full with those small ice cubes and then water.  I could refill it twice on my floor, the only slightly cool water speeding up the melt, but while it was on my desk it would hold that ice very well once the temps stabilized.  I have left it overnight with just ice and have hardly any melt.  I have left it overnight with aruond 25% ice and 25 water volume and still have a lot of ice when I get in the next morning.  Now, I have not carried this around, like in a backpack, so not sure how good this is at not leaking.  Other than carrying it by hand between floors and sitting on my desk, it does not get beat up and tossed around.  I am also careful when closing it, so the lid has held up well and no issues with the ring on it.  I really like this!  The stainless liner might bother some people, and sometimes it somewhat annoys me as I would rather have my ice water from a glass container, but for keeping things cold over a long stretch, which a large volume container, this cannot be beat.

It fits great, and it felt great when I wore it on bike commute to and from work today. I could even see myself purchasing the other color schemes, though now I'm not so sure.  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review. The discount did not influence my rating in any way (except to lead me to purchase this particular tank top over the alternatives).  See the attached photo for the general fit. I ordered a US small (my tag says large). For reference, I'm about 5'10"" and 170 pounds, so pretty substantially above the size recommendations they give for a small. But it fits as I was hoping it would (I generally wear t-shirts that are medium and sometimes small, and generally like it to fit pretty tight). The material is somewhat spandex-y, so it fits close, but doesn't feel tight.  So why the three stars? After wearing the shirt for the first time and getting back from work on my bike, I go to take it off by pulling from the top of the back of my shirt over my head, and it ripped badly right along the trim / tag line. Part of it probably had to do with how sweaty I was, but still, it was only the first time wearing the shirt. I recommend either taking off the shirt in a different way, or grabbing lower and much more material as you pull to avoid the tearing.  One other thought is that I expected the tank top to be tagless, but there is one of those horizontal tags on the inside. I didn't really feel it while wearing it, though.

Fortunately, my package seems to have been well treated and the wheel arrived undamaged.  Upon removing the wheel from the box, I noticed that the rim is made of thicker and heavier metal than the one that came with my bike.  It feels much sturdier than the old one, although only time will tell for sure.  A quick check revealed that the rim was nearly true, so I didn't bother trying to adjust it.  All of the nuts, washers, etc required to attach the wheel to the bike and secure the brake arm are included.  Most of these were in a little pouch, but a few were loose in the box and had to be hunted for.  The ends of the axle had poked holes in the sides of the box, but fortunately someone had the foresight to tape pieces of cardboard over the holes to prevent anything from falling out.  One nut was already on the axle and had become frozen in place.  It took a considerable amount of force to dislodge it, but after that it worked fine.  Also included in the pouch is a rear cog and retaining ring.  Since no instructions were included, I had to look at my old wheel to determine which way the cog went on, but it wasn't that difficult to install.  At first, the wheel made a bit of noise when spinning, so I took apart the coaster hub and found only a light coat of grease inside.  I applied a lot more grease, reassembled the hub, and it was nice and quiet after that.  If you don't know how to service or assemble a coaster hub, this might not be the wheel for you.  I've been riding on the new wheel for a few days now, including a trip of over 20 miles, and it seems to be working well.  In particular, the brake mechanism works much better than the one in the original wheel ever did.  Overall I'm quite happy with my purchase.
