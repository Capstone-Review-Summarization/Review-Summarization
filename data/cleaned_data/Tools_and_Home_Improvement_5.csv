I currently have two nearly similar porch lights but they have a frosted glass cover with a 15w 100w equivalent daylight bulb 1280lm This new light is definitely brighter than the original. It produces sharper shadows nearby.   The led does aim downward about 45degree angle so it doesn't seem as bright because The light doesn't shine in multiple directions (upwards) like a normal light bulb type. The reflector is a metal painted white with a smooth semi gloss/matte finish. So I added a piece of replacement mirror sheet cut to size. The replacement mirror was purchased from WM in the automotive section. It's a mirror finish rather than a matte reflective finish. And it is a must have diy addition just to have a better reflector than a piece of metal painted white. The clear plastic does have a linear design which is not at all bad. The body is a metal housing and the leds are Philips brand. The light has a nice rubber seal for weather protection.  I purchased the one without a dusk til dawn sensor.  I connected the lights on to a replacement electrical cord for testing location placement.  The two pictures of the front door area is the old 15w led bulb and the brighter picture is with the these shine hai lights.  Tempted to order another set or the wider commercial looking version.

26,531643,5,True,"03 13, 2010",A14JBDSWKPKTZA,B000YLS4S0,,Bob Feeser,"Having gone through all of the research for a newbie shower valve assy installation, I thought I would share some of that with you here. I paid my dues so why should you? :-) Anyhow, this shower model L2352 as the ad states does not come with volume control. What that means is the actual valve does not have the 2 adjusters, one on each side, one to control the hot overall inflow, and the other to control the cold overall inflow. The adjustable ones have a threaded adjusting rod with a seating nut so you can secure the setting once you found your ideal spot. The old Moen shower setup I was replacing had two adjustments, one that you pull away from the wall, and the other you turn in a clockwise direction for example to adjust the temperature setting. These new ones do not have that flow/pull it away from the wall option. They only adjust by spinning them around clockwise, which turns it on at a full flow, and adjusts temp considering where you leave the dial.  So to shed some light on the flow problem, my neighbor had a contractor install a shower and valve assy., one of unknown origin in their shower. It also did not have adjusters. The contractor also installed an energy saving shower massage, or shower head that produced a scant amount of flow. They complained because the flow was insufficient, which led them to taking much longer showers to get the job done of completely rinsing off. So they put on a fuller flow head, and then they didn't like it because the water flow was too much. All of this led to the problem of not having an adjustable flow control setting. You could install a couple of ball valves, or even a faucet type valve somewhere along the feed line, but that would result in you possibly having to go downstairs, and either have someone upstairs on the phone while taking a shower telling you which setting they like the best, or you have to try a setting, take a shower, try it again, etc. So it is ideal to have the 2 set screws right in front of you when you are taking the shower to get your preferences right.  All of this could be eliminated by using the combination of this high quality, yet money saving Chateau L2352, in combination with the consumer reports number one rated shower head; Moen 21777BN Brushed Nickel Inspire Inspire Seven Function Shower Head Only with 1/2 Inch Connection 21777 (or preferably get the 21778 with the shower massage setup) That puts out the preferred econo flow of 2.5 That is what I have, and I love the flow level. The satisfaction that is derived from that shower head is like the results of consumer reports; they used about 70 subjects who tried all different shower heads and flow levels, and hands down the Moen models I just mentioned won. Not only did they conserve water, they created such a large head, with so many fine jets, that you felt like you were getting flooded with water, but were actually conserving water instead. (Don't tell anyone :-) let them think they are getting the major flow model)  When I first went in to take a shower, I was anticipating a scarcer feeling flow, so much so that I wanted to even reduce it some. It was at that point that I understood that having the ideally suited adjustment would be nice. But upon taking my second shower, and having adjusted my mind to it, I loved the precise amount of flow I was already getting. (If not I could tweak it by installing the shut off valves inline) I really don't want to change a thing.  I had read in the forums that Moen does not advise you to install a shower shut off at the head, something about possibly damaging the anti-scalding valve. Calling the included 800 number for Moen was great. They are ready to answer any one of your installation etc. questions.  This Chateau model is a beautiful set. I also bought the Moen Model 1920: Chrome Remodeling Cover Plate which has the wonderful quality Moen chrome finish. It almost looks like it was hand polished as a final step. Cover plates are the wide cover that goes under the standard plate in the event that you are upgrading your old 2 handle model to this type that has the single handle and anti-scalding valve. If you need to knock out tile to open it up the hole is covered by the remodeling plate. The exact dimensions as well as other info are all available in PDF format at Moen.  My brother told me to get the brushed nickel because that was all the rage. I was considering doing a return exchange etc, but when I saw what the prices were I decided the chrome was great. The shower room is a separate room so to speak, and think when I do the bathroom, I am going to be looking for a combo brushed nickel and chrome set for the faucets which will tie it all together. I just got the Oxo Steel Garlic Press, Stainless which has that same combination which is gorgeous.  So there you have it. Get this Moen Chateau single, and save a bundle over the other models, and use the number one rated shower head to automatically adjust the flow to the precise spot you want, and save on the water bill. By the way that shower head is large enough to give you the feel of one of those very expensive huge rain shower heads, yet smaller enough to make it a comfortable hand held.  Another by the way is be sure and install the pipe to mount the head included in the kit with the long part going into the wall. That way you have sufficient clearance for the hose, away from the wall to allow the shower head to be adjusted to any position that suits you; even straight down, once again, creating that rainfall large head feeling. I'm out of space, so with all of this info you should be able to make the right decision for yourself. One note of caution pricing for these items varies widely. I did buy both the chateau shower posi-temp and cover plate here at Amazon, which had the best prices.  One final item worth mentioning is that I have an older home circa 1955 and the wall this setup is mounted into is 2 1/2"" deep, the maximum depth allowable with the kit. When I installed the cover plate, that took up another 3/4"". I was heartbroken when I felt like I had to return it for a flat plate, because the beauty of this thing, the way it is sculpted, and with a polished chrome look, I didn't want to part with it. Then I discovered that Moen sells an extension kit for walls that measure much thicker than that. All it is comprised of is a longer chrome tube that the handle mounts too, and some longer screws. So now I can enjoy the full setup including the remodeling plate. If you pull your existing plate off and take some measurements from the center of the pipe line, to the inside wall of your shower, you can use that info to check with the PDF file diagrams available for free at [...].  One more installation tip: Ignore the sticker on the valve section warning you to take it easy when soldering it in because you can damage the plastic and rubber valve components; instead, remove them altogether. It is so easy to just take it out, and then solder away the brass body. The secret to removing it is to use the included plastic removing tool. It has a square head on it so you can use a wrench or a pair of pliers to grab it. It slides down over the valve, and the 2 extender pieces sit down in there so you can spin it. Then just turn it like you would remove a jar lid, and because of the tapered sides at the top it pops. Then just use a good pair of pliers, and pull on the stem, and it comes right out. Everything that you would be concerned about overheating is contained right inside of the cartridge. The body as I mentioned is all metal. When you are done, reinstalling is even easier. Just line up the plastic tab marked H-C at the top, and top is marked ""Up"" on the housing, and push it straight in all the way. Your done. It couldn't be simpler.  Oh and one more thing. Remember how I said that the price on this stuff is all over the place. I just saw, current as of today, the model from Moen just like this one; the one with the volume control, and the price wasn't that much different than this one. So if you want to use your old shower head, and set it and forget it concerning the flow level, get that one instead. I love the consumer reports number one rated shower head mentioned above. It makes all the difference. The Chateau is nice for anti-scalding, but you won't notice much of a difference over what you already had, when you add the shower head, you are on a different planet.  The initial reason why I bought this posi-temp model is that I no longer have to fear someone flushing a toilet, or turning on a spigot in the house while I am showering and then getting scalded. I got so caught up in the design and installation stuff I almost forgot to mention that. I love my new shower setup, and I believe you will too.","Moen Chateau Shower, Set up Tips and More",1268438400,66.0,,adjuster satisfaction extension wall flow/pull go cold preference spigot consider event notice sell wide fear say shower ideal anti-scalding conserve eliminate mounted fine actually try room one downstairs get many thing allow press flow sure different possibly steel direction oh call preferably read spin dial really polished bill position comprise plier part model turn tell understood setup right complain scalded point exact pull insufficient let slide believe easy fuller home type question couple energy valve ready step stuff almost tie adjusts brother stainless would actual metal forget everything small water faucet leave adjustment info remove volume toilet either head exchange extender saw overall scant two set forget combo wrench taper return go precise example do remodel dimension tell note tab faucet thread inspire feeling give upstairs seven away phone house plastic chrome much amount think oxo enjoy create rubber save like caution derive ideally level section could come turn take open shower allowable contractor screw problem today cover money posi-temp deep shower long finish replacing upon pair one depth love wall new anyhow unknown option solder installation instal bundle exist worth gorgeous solder first amazon item turn feed lead remember overheat component tweak top damage pdf buy etc also felt lid heartbroken simpler inside upgrade flood concern grab install dues secure clearance mention caught side adjustment create yet old tried include tube center adjust pay use plate adjusting save ignore piece garlic second hold nice spot newbie hand use head longer price automatically flush econo ball decision neighbor need maximum think expensive hot nut job suit cartridge anyone enough secret take change mount tip hand mean initial want tile go found reinstall altogether conserve shut huge jar consumer shed format push origin prefer go quality discover place remove forum beautiful separate able free bathroom hole suit set single good report take use pricing side warn design come major housing inline result produce mind get thicker check standard level rainfall spin scarcer rage jet front concerned sit buy make adjustable knock moen i'm valve inflow best combination rinse planet along beauty look varies wonderful body kit instal well research another difference final look control mark look measure damage diagram stem way love result seat connection model ad space chateau straight share add someone completely state function put high h-c inch something great already feel adjust handle line sufficient put somewhere rain tool include square advise file clockwise nickel answer speak reason mention go large tell reduce together comfortable temp price number light want full sticker measurement decide plate item circa even rod temperature hose easy brass anticipate subject current pops massage assy mount widely around pipe contain instead cover mention rat make flat available sculpt get old brush

I put them around the house by toilets and not two weeks go by and one is already screaming. I was a bit pissed about it, until I got into the bathroom and found water on the floor! Well, at least I know they work! :)  As others have said, there is no off switch. These guys scream until the batteries die. However, after having set this one off, I see how they work now. There is a yellow sponge (similar to a kitchen sponge, actually) in the base. On top of the sponge is a copper plate. As soon as water hits the sponge, it swells and the copper plate makes a connection, causing the buzzer to sound. Now, if you carefully pull the little white ring off of the bottom, the protective mesh comes off, and you can remove the sponge. Just set it aside and the buzzer stops. When the sponge is semi-dry, put something heavy on it (I used a soup can) for a few days. The sponge will shrink down flat again, and you can re-insert it into the base and put everything back together. I did this with the one that went off, and it's working perfectly. So they ARE semi-reusable, if you care to spend the time to take it apart a bit. Honestly, it'll take you two minutes to do it.  Anyhow, good product and I'd buy again.  Update: lots of folks asked for details on how to reuse these, so read above and check out the pictures below. The key is to gently remove the rubber ring and pull the sponge out by the mesh covering. Once you have that off, the alarm stops. I peel the copper sticker off the top, and put a heavy weight on the sponge for about 5-7 days. At that point, the sponge is back to being flat and will stay that way until it gets touched by water again. The important part is to make sure it dries in the flat condition. Then, just put the copper sticker back on, and reassemble it with the rubber ring. You're good to go for another use. I've now done this three times and haven't had any false alarms, and they've worked perfect.

There are times when you will need to use two hands.  The reason I gave it three stars is due the the adjustable measurement point. When you set it it is good. But more often than not you will have to reset it between uses. The design they used to lock it in place is not very good. If you bump it, move it or something like that you will need to reset it. It not very profitable if you're at a job site and you have to stop and take time to make sure it is set correct every time you need to use it. It is not a terrible  product. It has served me well enough. But it takes too much time to verify it's accuracy. Time is money. Now I know it's not a track saw. I never expected it to be. For the price point,  it isn't a bad buy.  ***  UPDATE.  ***  A few days after I posted this review, my Rip Cut broke to the point that I can no longer use it. The plastic piece that Kreg uses to lock the body onto the rail (the plastic flip tab you flip over to lock the saw into place once you set it onto the desired measurement mark indicated on the rail). It was not very sturdy out of the box. The design is flawed. The part that broke, the flip tab, is plastic. The design requires tension to lock the saw into place on the measurement marks. The locking mechanism when loose allows the saw to move on the rail. When tight, it locks the saw into place. The flaw is that the part that has the most pressure on it is plastic. Push, pull, it doesn't matter which way it is done, the pressure will break the plastic flip tab. This piece needs to be metal for this design to work.

The belt will probably need to be stretched a little before the first installation to get it to fit easier onto the Work Sharp, and the instructions mention this.  Also, you may need to adjust the belt tracking on the Work Sharp to get this belt to track straight.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase but only time will tell if the product lasts.  UPDATE:  I didn't think that this additional information would be necessary, but since there are a few individuals who have very dangerously improperly used the belt in their machines, here are a few VERY IMPORTANT things people should know if they don't already:  1.  You must stretch the belt in order to get it to fit prior to first use.  If you don't know the reasoning, read the instructions that come with the belt. 2.  This leather belt is NOT intended to be used with the guide attachment that comes with the Work Sharp.  It is intended to be used free-hand as if you were using a standard belt sander.  After installing the leather belt, leave the guides off.  If you don't know how to hone/strop knives free-hand with a belt sander, please do some research with your favorite web browser and on Youtube. 3.  NEVER use the leather belt with the belt moving in the opposite direction that the knife edge is pointing.  Some people claim to do it but it is a safety hazard and there simply is no need to.  Common sense should tell you that the knife edge will bite and cut into the leather, potentially flinging the knife who knows where.  Orient the Work Sharp so that it is facing you, and with the knife edge pointing DOWN, strop ONLY with the side of the belt that is also TRACKING DOWNWARD.  To work the other side of the knife, turn the knife around to the other side (not upside down!).  The edge of the knife should still be pointing DOWN in the same direction that the belt is tracking. 4.  If you are still unclear about how to use the leather belt, find the Youtube video titled ""BEST WAY to Sharpen Any Knife RAZOR SHARP!"".  The leather belt portion starts at about the 5 minute mark.  These are my opinions and are not intended to be regarded as fact.  I have no affiliation with the makers of this leather belt nor the link posted above.  I paid full price when it was first released.  But since my review is near the top of the list, I felt it was my responsibility to include additional information that may help prevent a visit to the ER or even the morgue.",Very Nice Leather Belt for the Ken Onion Work Sharp,1449964800,121.0,,know track nice er guide hone/strop additional prevent use find onto work orient hazard belt way nicely come responsibility order strop opposite start straight edge simply come need potentially attachment near product think upside post get video important track claim high favorite razor allow guide please already direction must stretch happy reason read pack stretched little thing machine knife sharpen fact leather mark title tell quality turn make sharp free-hand improperly point sense cut installation easy instal detailed maintenance instruction use probably youtube face stretch fit regard list first come knife update bite price minute individual unclear morgue full safety help time intend purchase common information would top white standard affiliation also felt visit still link purposely proper onion even necessary dangerously leave include side release never short prior opinion stretch around since fling best overall moving last along know downward mention maker compound ken people adjust web pay use research sander may browser portion review

For small terminals, you may need to tighten the crimp a bit, in the area of the jaw closest to the hinge, which is no big deal if you are doing a crimp here or there, but if you do a lot of work with very thin wire and terminals, it may be a good idea to look to a plier that has a smaller crimp notch.

I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.  I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.  I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm.

My first thought was that it is similar to the little key boxes that real estate agents leave attached to door knobs, but this holds more than a key. The container is about the size of a measuring cup. Nice if you want to leave something bigger such as a set of keys with a key chain.  It took about 60 seconds to read through the instructions and begin using it. It was pretty intuitive. The hardest part was opening the container to find the instructions.  The combination uses letters instead of numbers. The obvious benefit is that it might be easier to remember a word than it is to remember 4 digits. The downside is that using a word as the combination dramatically limits the quantity of possible combinations. There are only so many 4 letters words to spell with the limited letters that are available. If instead, you use abbreviations or initials, it would be more secure. You can decide how important it is to avoid someone guessing the words.

The switch is plastic and just doesn't look sufficiently upscale for $4k granite countertops.  And speaking of granite, the box indicates ""Perfect for granite..."" but the switch has a shaft which will only accommodate a 5/8"" thick countertop.  As the switch is not long enough for the depth of granite a kluged extension is provided.  The shaft extension screws onto a smaller threaded shaft (1/4"" dia.) at the bottom of the larger shaft.  The smaller shaft was designed to only hold the tightening nut for the fiber optic cable and I do not believe this is suitable engineering - the switch is completely plastic.  The adapter was probably done in this manner because the thickness of solid surface tops was not considered in the initial design and for the need to keep the 3/8"" overall shaft size.  I've installed the fiber optic switch and it works as described.  The timed shutoff is an excellent feature.  The controller box is installed in the sink cabinet, plugged into an outlet and the garbage disposal plugs into the controller box.  As most garbage disposals are hard-wired you will most likely have to install an outlet box.  ISE and other garbage disposals typically have an accessory pack which have the parts to install a plug on the garbage disposal.  Update:  The switch has now been installed for about 2 years.

McQuay,"Caveat, this is the only honing guide I've owned or needed but I had no difficulty figuring out how it works or obtaining better than razor sharp edges on my planes and chisels. My system is the popular ""scary sharp"" which is a series of glass plates with sandpaper attached ranging from 80 grit (for flattening soles) to 2000 grit (for final edge). I bought the General honing guide about 10 years ago because it was the only one I could find that would handle wide plane blades. This guide allows me to obtain an edge that shaves hair with no effort, easily sharper than any razor I purchased.  To address some concerns which I believe are primarily because people do not know how to sharpen.  1. It is not ""cheap plastic"" unless you consider all plastic cheap. According to the description it is fiberglass reinforced Lexan, I did not know that previously but I know mine is very sturdy. Bullet proof windows, airplane canopies, race car windshields, and headlight lenses are all made of Lexan. If you break this it is because you abused it or used it incorrectly.  2. It does not take hours to sharpen a chisel. The very first time will take longer since you need to flatten the back and establish an angle. The cheaper the chisel the more time you will spend on this critical first step. The finer the abrasive, the longer this step will take which is why I begin with a very coarse paper. The idea is you flatten or establish an angle with a coarse grit then spend a few seconds on each finer grit polishing out marks made by the previous paper. If you use stones for the flattening stage, yes, you will be at it for hours. If you are constantly changing the angle as some reviewers have stated, you are doing it wrong. The secondary bevel and subsequent sharpenings will take a minute or two.  This may not be the best honing guide out there but it does produce excellent results if used correctly and if you know how to sharpen.  I would like to add that while some of the criticisms are valid, they are equally true of every honing guide in this price range and up to several times the price.",Better than some reviewers would suggest,1353974400,43.0,,figure know lexan windshield proof guide plastic fiberglass reviewer coarse effort i've plane find use break longer like valid wide result hour scary true could edge add accord need canopy obtain lens caveat glass time finer several razor sturdy sol take description equally mine begin obtain abused well correctly range handle stage sharpen one sharp shave headlight series need bevel back make window sharp popular hair establish angle wrong yes believe own consider flatten airplane use grit reinforce primarily state cheap sharpenings first step price plane minute cheap time purchase difficulty would spend mark sandpaper plate chisel concern paper produce general ago work edge easily year polish stone chisel idea buy second constantly subsequent car bullet since blade best two range hone critical race attach previous system address excellent flatten secondary allows people previously criticisms abrasive incorrectly final every may change unless
332,1892124,4,True,"10 6, 2012",AR121G6ZC2SV7,B0012BU91Q,{'Color:': ' White'},Peter,"I wanted a motion-detecting light switch that also had a nightlight. I use them in the bathrooms; the nightlight provides enough light in the middle of the night that I don't have to turn on the main lights and then have night blindness as a stumble back to bed. (OK, TMI, but that's my main application)  I purchased several of these and also similar units from Cooper (OS310WU). So far all have worked, but the reliability and feature set of the Cooper units makes them preferable to the Leviton versions. I'll compare both below:  Both have motion-sensing and can be used as just manual on / auto-off and as auto on and off. I use them both ways; manual on in the master bath and auto-on in the guest bath and garage. The timeout duration is controlled by a rotary setting on both, but while it seems to not have any ""stops"" both units only allow 3 durations for the timeout. I have had older switches where these potentiometers get flaky after a while so this may be better. Neither will dim the lights (making them suitable for some flourescent lights and LEDs that can't be dimmed).  Both do an adequate job of sensing motion and turning the lights on and then off after a delay. My Levition unit has been intermittent, sometimes not turning the lights on and sometimes not turning them off, but right now it seems to be working normally. I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Both have a nice nighlight that you can enable, it shines through the manual button on the Cooper and through the IR window on the Leviton. The Cooper nightlight is brighter, and it also can be set to a preset dim level over a wide range of brightness. This is fantastic. The Leviton dim level is fixed and less pleasing to look at as it has the IR fresnel lens distorting it.  Both require a neutral, hot, ground and load wire in the switch box. Be forewarned; a lot of electricians wire the circuit breaker to the light and then just a switch pair to the switch. You should really download the manual and also check your switch box wiring before buying either of these.  Both support 3-way switching, but differently. The Leviton uses an extra wire to go to a normal SPDT 3-way switch that can change the light's state. The Cooper requires you to use a second identical switch in the other location and ties the load lines together ( and they have to be on the same breaker of course). I found the Cooper mode more useful as I could put a motion switch at each end of a staircase and the lights came on regardless of the direction I came from; with the Leviton you can only have one motion sensor in the circuit. The Cooper implementation keeps the lights on until all of the sensors have timed out. That's great for my workshop where I don't want to be working in one end and have the sensor just in the other end of the room turn off the lights. But it also means you can't turn off the lights manually as the other switch is still active; lights will only go off after a timeout.  Both switches have a cover that hides the control settings. The Cooper's can be removed fairly easily; you have to remove the wallplate to remove the Leviton's cover. That's a pain if you want to fine tune the timeouts after installation.  Both are very good products, but I will buy the Cooper version if I add more to my house. It seems slightly better designed and easier to use.","Good switch, but I like the Cooper version better",1349481600,2.0,,blindness second product bathroom bath nice breaker tune sense house master fix i'll reliability switch use wallplate button hide feature duration come wide dim control extra require load download spdt way level led could stop add fine regardless useful distort room cooper's hot timeouts job night normal unit normally can't finger fresnel differently get location several mode allow enough crossed seem change buy leviton's great make auto-on slightly timeout nighlight sensor want state nightlight auto-off direction mean unit pain good middle provide range less box enable neutral tie ok find put fairly really staircase that's neither suitable dimmed pair course one lot application turn back guest right manually rotary similar stumble far cooper compare installation flourescent manual easier good set duration intermittent light's work used levition together leviton line version motion-sensing turn light light want preset active version switch purchase wire fantastic forewarned auto sometimes bed check buy adequate ir also lens switch still preferable ground electricians sensor time easily remove garage brightness brighter identical shine main either require implementation design potentiometer window circuit set work workshop cover look keep motion-detecting end make wire motion go setting control tmi delay remove may older please us keep flaky support

Over the years, just to cover the exterior sides, top, and front air vents, I have tried bubble wrap, styrofoam cut to size and taped in place, plastic drop cloths, you name it. Inevitably, all of these materials seemed to disintegrate half-way through the winter (even with the vinyl cover on).  Use of the internal room-facing AC covers (both cloth and plastic) didn't help either.  While searching around for more substantial covers, I stumbled upon this product and its 5-star reviews so I purchased a roll. I was elated at how easy it was to measure and cut pieces to size and I have wrapped one AC today.  I had joined the pieces with some aluminum tape, attached the finished insulation enclosure to the AC cabinet with some more tape, covered  that with the vinyl cover, and secured the whole thing with a long, heavy-duty bungee cord. I hope to be able to re-use the enclosures each year - just detach from the ACs, fold flat, and store.  I can already foresee other uses for this product!  I may buy more to try for mini greenhouse use.  EDIT: May 25, 2015 - As an update, this was perfect over the winter as insulation around the exterior of my window AC units (with a regular vinyl cover over it), as February alone was around the 5th coldest on record here. I even used pieces to help insulate the exterior sides of the AC accordion panels). This past spring, I was able to easily remove the coverings that I constructed and stow them away for use next season.

I have had problems with my Zoeller sump pump where at times it would not power on when the water level was well above the float and tapping the discharge pipe would make the pump fire up. Initially I though the problem was maybe the switch. However I just replaced the switch again and the problem remained. So I took out the pump for further troubleshooting. What I found is that the metal ""guard"" above the float may have been low enough to cause an occasional problem. What I did is gently bent the guard upward while on the pump. You don't want to use too much pressure upward because you don't want to damage the switch housing or do it off the pump. I verified that at the lowest position the guard will no longer have a potential to keep the float from going all the way up. I then sprayed some Corrosion-X into the two holes where the guard attaches to the pump and worked the guard up and down. The guard should have a little play up and down. If you are changing the switch I suggest while you have the switch housing off, clean out the two holes where the metal guard attaches to the pump and put some lubricant or marine grease in there.

He had replaced it with an all-glass door and knew I would be interested in it. I got it home. Cleaned it up with some Murphy's Oil and was all excited about it. It included the original door knob and recessed door knob backplate. I then glanced at it and thought, ""Why is that doorknob way over there?"" I'm not hardly old enough to remember when 5 inch backsets were common, but knew that's what I needed. I tried Home Depot, Lowes, even Wal-mart, but none of them had them or knew where I could get one. I even asked an older contractor, who gave me what sounded like the best advice, ""Just use the backset that is in the door with a new knob and lock."" So I started working on getting the old door knob off which was a lesson in patience since I didn't realize it all removed from one side first. That's also when I realized I couldn't use the old backset with a new knob. It was built into the old door knob. I did what any reasonable person would do and opened Amazon. There it was.

Good quality bits as expected, way to many PH2 bits, would have liked a few Torqx and more squares, the long bit holder says ""china"" and has basic bit retention, but at least it's a long one which isn't too common in drive bit sets which is good because they could have simply put the basic shorty bit holder instead, so I'll give them a few points for that.  The 2 nut setters are 1/4"" and 5/16' and are nice impact quality, same for the 3/8"" socket driver, the two sockets are 3/8"" and 1/2"", with laser engraved DeWalt impact rating specs, very nice again.  My only grip about this set are the lack of retention for the clear blown plastic holding the 2 sockets, because whenever you open the case too fast, the plastic insert fall down due to the weight of the sockets, but the sockets stay put, so it can be annoying to always have to put the insert back, although there's plenty of fix around this issue (move the insert to the other side, glue it, tape it, etc). And I do like Irwin Impact Series case a lot better than the Dewalt case. DeWalt's are bulky and not even square, while Irwin has a nice square case to maximize the inside storage and also a full metal hinge and a more positive locking slide. Sometimes I'd buy the Irwin bit sets just for the case when they're on sale, so I get all similar cases and it's easier to stack them neatly in the tool box. DeWalt do have more fancy bit retention trays, which are obviously gonna withstand thousands of in&out before even starting to get flimsy, but they're not very quick to insert back the bits while the Irwin ones take less than a second for both in&out. Geez I still can't believe we went on the moon with a computer as powerful as my old timex watch, but haven't made the perfect bit case with perfect bit tray yet.  When Amazon blow these impact drive set on sale, it's always worth getting them.

For the record, we range from 52"" to 62 in our household. As it turned out, this slightly taller toilet turned into the immediate favorite in our household and we ended up changing out the other low toilets as well!  Installation was as easy as you would expect---who likes removing and replacing toilets, after all? We bought a molded wooden soft-close toilet seat (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B00HS4YYHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>) which also increases the height slightly, so take that into consideration (there are some very thin plastic seats also available). Flush is effective and the tank fills back up quickly.  My one star off is for a couple of minor points. First, the tank is 8"" thick from front to back, which is much smaller than the one on the previous toilet; because of the placement of the existing pipes and floor flange, this means there is about a 3"" gap between the back of the tank and my wall. I don't like the look of that, and things set on top usually fall into the gap. If you are doing new installation then this won't be an issue since you can determine the placement of pipes and the flange. Second, the low water level means that flushing creates a weird ""glurting"" sound, which is louder than ideal.  As for plunging issues: in the 18 months since we installed this, I have had to plunge once. I used our existing plunger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B0006IXNDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>) and had no problems whatsoever, though the plunger is round and the toilet opening sort of square-ish.

But, like most hand trucks, it doesnt have a toe plate deep enough for moving my potted plants.  I have quite a few tropical plants that spend most of the year out in the yard but when temps drop down to 50-deg or below, I need to move them inside the garage.  Problem is, some are in very large ceramic pots (20 diameter or more), which means I needed a hand truck with at least a 12 toe plate so I can get more than half the base of the pot on the plate.  This puppy fit the bill.  The toe plate is 15.75 deep so it can easily handle a large diameter pot that weighs upwards of 150 lbs.  Like some other reviewers, I would have liked an actual toe bar to help with the leverage when lifting but you can still use the back of the toe plate.  In addition, for a large and sturdily-constructed truck as this, I would have appreciated larger/wider wheels.  The wheels are 8 diameter and about 1.75 wide, so they can present a challenge when you are hauling something heavy across anything other than a solid surface or need to get it over a very small step.  The fold-away handlebars are a nice feature and do make it easier to control the load during some push/pull situations.  Honestly, I wasn't looking for a collapsible/portable hand truck but this one is both sturdy and easily tucked away in the garage.

These particular ballasts are smaller than the OEM ballasts I replaced. I didn't worry about drilling new mounting holes and all that. I was lucky enough to be able to use just one of my mounting screew holes from the old ballast to hold them in place. If they were going to be accessed daily, yeah, but they're not. One mounting screw was plenty to hold the ballast in place while I worked.    You'll find yourself cutting the supplied wiring as there is DEFINITELY plenty to work with. I was also able to utilize the slip lock wiring terminals on the existing bulb sockets as well. So that, along with knowing how to read a wiring diagram, allowed me to be able to jumper the yellow sockets and not have to use a single wire nut on anything but the input power wiring.    Once installed, the lights came on instantly without any type of hesitation.  I was used to my old ones taking a couple of seconds to come on, so that alone was a plus. Also, there is no humming or buzzing when the lights are on. If memory serves, the old ballasts buzzed from day one. All I'm seeing from these is a bright, quiet, flicker-free light when I hit the switch. I figured I was going to have to replace some of my old bulbs as they were getting pretty dim. Definitely a surprise knowing all I had to do after replacing the ballasts was run a damp cloth over the bulbs to knock off the dust to get light as bright as I had when I first installed them.

I purchased my first one back in September of 2006.  When it's fully compact, it measures about 5 fT high.  You press the buttons on the joints and it goes into an upside-down ""V"" painter's ladder, and you can extend either side as you see fit.  Extending one side is not necessarily dependent on the position of the other side, they both extend freely so that you can position the ladder on stairs, or prop it up against a wall that you don't necessarily want to lean the ladder against.  Or you can adjust again so that it's your standard ladder and prop it up against any wall/tree up to 22 feet high!  The ladder is incredibly versatile and strong, which leads me to some pros and cons:  Pro: Almost impossible to dent, ding, or scratch.  Not that i've hit it with a hammer before, but I have dropped it accidentally a few times, and once it fell off my wall because my wall mounts fell out, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the ladder.  Con: Due to its strength, the ladder is heavier than average.  I have felt other compact ladders that fold up like this, and they can be very lightweight - this is NOT lightweight.  I am 6ft tall and 215 lbs, I can lift a pretty big load, and this guy is a little tough to lift over my head to get on it's wall mount in my garage.  Also, you need to make sure mounts are heavy-duty and are screwed right into the studs if you want to put this on a wall.  Pro: There are something like 16 different height/position possibilities with one of these. I've used almost all of them at least once.  Con: The adjusting levers / buttons can require a bit of force to get them to adjust, more than the ""comfortable amount"".  Sometimes I have to slap them really hard to get them in place. But this thing is extremely heavy duty, and I have zero doubt that they will break while I'm standing on it 20 feet in the air!  Pro: 22 ft tall at full extension with a wide base.  I feel securely in position even when on the hightest step at the highest setting.  The wide base allows for 4 points of contact which increases stabilization.  Con: There can be a little bit of wobbling - but this can happen with any ladder depending on the surface you are on.","Sturdy, Strong, Weather-resistant",1381104000,5.0,,know extension duty heavy possibility hard pro air contact go base i've amount head break extremely ladder like lean wobble stand wide depend load heavy-duty surface upside-down ft average compact painter's need september fell hammer time last tall least get high pro point thing due screw system press con button versatile mount big sure something stabilization force different feel accidentally lbs put little really position one dependent drop wall back extend wall/tree lift measure place right high increase foot forever securely necessarily set use stair ladder fit comfortable slap first hightest step bit want lever almost fully full zero purchase scratch sometimes standard extend felt also strength lightweight see even convinced hit giant stud lead garage joint fold side make height/position either require mount i'm prop incredibly doubt ding impossible con allow adjust happen tough heavy freely strong adjust dent look guy pretty

662,820697,3,True,"03 4, 2012",AMY5IZDNGURB8,B003SNK2CW,,Steven,"Purchased this as an extension for my Ridgid R4512 table saw.  As an earlier reviewer notes, there are no included brackets to mount it with, you have to fashion your own.  I did this using some 1 1/2"" aluminum angle purchased from my local big orange hardware store, attaching it with some 5/16"" hex bolts.  Once leveled and and securely bolted the table is very sturdy, and the added weight is not enough to make me worry it will overbalance the table saw.  The fence and dust hood work well.  The fence slides smoothly, although after every time you remove it you will have to take off the knobs for the bolts which attach it to the table, since there is no way to rotate the bolts to align them with the tracks unless you can actually grasp the bolt shaft.  I might later replace the included bolts with ones that are slightly longer so the shaft protrudes from the top of the knob enough to hold.  It is also disappointing that neither the dust hood nor the included adapter fits my standard 2 1/2"" shop vac hose, even though they are almost the same size.  The included base plate is poor quality.  The leveling screws work well, but the corners are about 1/16"" lower than the middle edges, which means you can never get the plate truly flush with the table at all 8 compass points.  The yellow ring insert was quite loose and had about 1/16"" play in it, which I was able to compensate for by adding a small piece of duct tape to the underside edge.  The plate itself is quite loose in the table top.  The table's rabbeted edge is symmetrical, but the plate has irregularly shaped edges.  I had some 'corner snuggers' from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rousseau-3509-9-Inch-x-12-Inch-x-3-8-Inch-Deluxe-Router-Base-Plate/dp/B00002242B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rousseau 3509 9-Inch x 12-Inch x 3/8-Inch Deluxe Router Base Plate</a>&nbsp;plate I had purchased before that I used to stabilize it.  Considering that this plate is sold with the table, there really is no excuse for the fit to be so sloppy.  Perhaps if I'd bought the version of the table that comes with an aluminum plate I'd be more impressed, but currently it is not sold on Amazon, only on the MLCS website.  On the whole, this is a good table for the price, but there is considerable room for improvement.  If you already own a decent router plate and won't need to use the included one, consider this a 4 1/2 star review; but if you are planning on using the one that comes with the table, cross your fingers you get one better than mine.","Good value, requires some work",1330819200,33.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EUINmJOcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N9lAfZsiL._SY88.jpg']","extension local smoothly adapter dust overbalance compass base use shop quite work star consider long small way level sell yellow reviewer snuggers edge need actually might room one hold router finger impress vac planning insert get excuse point sturdy poor enough i'd screw take big slightly already level later note mean compensate mine well size although middle bolt earlier underside ring rabbet irregularly knobs really neither include one play website replace fence cross quality table ridgid currently add improvement whole angle stabilize securely slides able good consider add use truly fit protrudes amazon come a&nbsp;<a price considerable weight almost align version time sloppy purchase bolt perhaps mlcs fit top standard track table's corner also decent even edge plate</a>&nbsp;plate aluminum data-hook=""product-link-linked hose attach remove shaft hex class=""a-link-normal fashion make bought never mount disappoint piece bracket since saw worry corner orange though attach rotate unless grasp hood shape bolt use well knob hardware plate deluxe symmetrical loose every flush low tape duct store review"

I debated between this touch faucet and a sensor faucet by Moen (which is more expensive - around $400 - but you don't even have to touch it to work, just wave in front of sensor although it does have some quirks).  A plus of buying this faucet over the Moen hands free sensor one is that it does not dispense water unless you need it (the Moen can dispense water at inconvenient times due to it's sensor) and the installation is much easier (and thus cheaper to pay a plumber to install).  This Delta faucet is a great advancement in faucets and provides plenty of convenience.

This is great when cooking and having your hands full of raw meat or other messy food products. I no longer have to constantly clean up the faucet after cooking.

It has worked every time although a couple of times, I've had to tap a second time before it works.  Not a big deal.  I am happy with the style and function of this touch sensor faucet.

800,1833950,3,False,"01 21, 2005",AU3YAUZLOSX6Z,B0000222V0,,Luke T. Evans,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who like this router for its smoothness, power,and low noise level. The grips are great, it plunges nicely, and the quality of materials seems top rate. However, my experience with this router has revealed two flaws that greatly detract from what would otherwise be a truly fine machine. While these flaws are not necessarily deal-breakers, those of you who are considering buying this tool may want to be aware of them.  First, as another reviewer has pointed out, it is impossible to accurately center template guides within the base plate. The user must screw the template guide holder into the baseplate, and since the holder does not precisely register into the baseplate, it is thus extremely difficult to accurately center the guides. If you use template guides and require even a moderate degree of accuracy, this flaw is a deal-breaker. Do not buy this router. On the other hand, if you never use template guides or plan on parking this baby in a router table, you'll have no problems. This would be a fine router for those purposes.  The other problem is another quality/design issue that can be remedied but is a moderate annoyance. On my machine, the release/locking lever for the plunge mechanism came loose on several occassions, making it impossible to plunge and lock the router at a desired depth. There is a small set screw in the lever mechanism that works loose and has to be constantly  tightened and adjusted. This problem is not an isolated incident as it also has occured with two other cabinetmakers and their identical routers in my shop. In the end, having tired of constantly fiddling with our machines, the three of us adjusted the mechanisms as best we could, applied Lock-Tite to the set screws, and hoped we did it right because there would be no way to disassemble the levers once the Lock-Tite cured. Fortunately, the fix worked fine, and all three of us are happily using our machines without any problems. Again, not a deal-breaker and the problem was fixed, but this seems unnecessary for a $200 router.  The other router to consider in this price range is the DeWalt DW625 3 HP plunge router. Though it has more power than the PC 8529, it is the same size and weight. It's also variable speed and would be great in a router table.

Only maintenance needed was one cord replacement, a few tip and light bulb replacements, and occasional tip tightening.  When it finally died, I bought a low wattage Weller gun and was always frustrated by it's slow heating and not enough heat to solder even simple 14 ga. wires.  After getting this model, eager to try it, I felt like I had my old trusty dual heat gun resurrected - only better, since it heats up very fast and proceeds to do what I ask of it.

The play and charge battery would no longer hold a charge longer than an hour so I wanted a rechargeable solution that was not as expensive as the play and charge battery and also versatile.  After looking at countless rechargeable battery options I settled on the Panasonic eneloop AA batteries with individual cell charger.  I was torn between the Amazon Basic rechargeable batteries that have been commented on as being rebranded 2nd generation Sanyo eneloop.  I wanted more recharge cycles and the battery charger, plus when I bought these they were on sale.  I have yet to recharge the batteries yet and have had about 4 hours in playtime on my Xbox controller playing COD which has a lot of vibration feedback when playing.  Since the controller only takes two batteries I put the other two in my Maglite Mini Flashlight.  I like that the batteries retain their power over a longer period of time and that they can be used effectively down to -4 degrees F.  This is great for my flashlight as I keep it in my vehicle for emergencies.  I am definitely thinking of buying more for my sons toys.  I am going to check and see if the batteries I have now work with them before buying more as some have mentioned the batteries have a 1.2 V discharge which can be insufficient for devices requiring 1.5 V.  So far I like these batteries and will test them out in as many devices I can.  ***UPDATE*** I have been using these AA batteries in everything I can get my hands on.  They work in flashlights, children toys, lanterns and everything else I've tried them in.  The charger that comes in this pack works great and can charge 1 at a time or 4 at a time and everywhere in between.  You can not only charge the AA batteries but the a AAA batteries as well.

I've been thinking about upgrading my tubes to LEDs for a while; after getting to the point where about six bulbs and one ballast were dead, I decided to take the plunge. I ended up spending $95 on this purchase, rather than spending about $75 on the bulbs and a replacement ballast, so for just $25 I upgraded six fixtures to all-LED lighting.  Those four fixtures were each four-bulb fixtures, but I had already been okay with lower light levels with a few bulbs burnt out. So I figured I would just install two of these bulbs and see how it looked. In short, each one of these tubes are MUCH brighter than a pair of five year old fluorescent bulbs. So the overall light level went UP when I went from four bulbs to two LED tubes. And my power consumption went down from 250 watts per room to 48.  So doing the math, at about six hours a day, I have saved $16 per bulb per year - and since the bulbs were just $8 each, these bulbs will pay for themselves in just six months.  Installation was very easy. I'm handy with tools, so your experience may differ. But the instruction sheet was very clear, and I made SURE before I started that I had shunted ""tombstone"" bulb holders that would be compatible with these dual-end-wired tubes. (One of my fixtures was non-shunted; since I had to remove a lot of extra wire during the conversion, I simply shunted them myself and still had quite a bit of wire to discard.) It took me under ten minutes per four-bulb fixture, and the resulting wiring was a lot simpler than with a ballast.  The bulbs fit perfectly. The pins are slightly smaller diameter than regular fluorescent tubes, so they were not quite as tight as I wanted in the press-in tombstones (but they were fine in the older twist-in tombstones); however, they are tight enough to stay put, and these tubes are pretty light.  Since I just installed these today, I naturally can't report on reliability, but I'm not really concerned; the quality looked decent and they were well-packaged.  In my mind, the only negative was that the clear (non-frosted) tubes mean easily visible bright bands across the fixture diffuser plastic. But that was my choice, since frosted tubes waste lumens and I would have had less light.  I highly recommend these bulbs.","Wow!

A razor edge will dull very quickly and deform with the hard use a tool, like a lawn mower blade, is put through. To sharpen an axe or anything with a similar edge,  you need a large course stone like this Lansky Dual Grit Sharpener.   This stone is the size of the average persons palm, so you have a good, safe grip on the stone while you have your hands around sharp edges. Some people use a motorized grinding wheel, but if you don't pay attention you can take too much metal off the edge in less than a second. It takes a little more time to manually sharpen your tools, but in the long run you'll get the edge that you want with no mistakes or injuries. You can also touch up your lawn mower blades while they're still on the mower, no need to take them off. The stone is more portable and will allow you to take it to the tool, rather than having to disassemble any equipment and make a trip back to the motorized grinder.   You'll find many things to sharpen with this stone like old dulled screw drivers, your old chisels, hammer claws, etc. I went through all my tools and was able to revive many of my old tools and make them usable again.

If you paint a light coat with the color underneath the tape, the bleeding will not show, and the edge fo the tape will be sealed. Always start with the lightest colors first. The darker color with cover the paint you used to seal the tape. When the tape is pulled up, you will have a crisp, sharp edge. (OK, 99% of the time it works - nothing is completely idiot proof.) Because I am NOT a patient worker, I also need a tape that would not pull up freshly painted layers. The yellow tape is designed with that in mind.

I bought this because I've had good success with another Optimus product, and they have 3-year warranties and wanted something for the shop/garage.  Physical: The build quality and design actually seem pretty decent, and seems fairly durable, although time will tell. The knobs and the plastic are pretty good quality with smooth action in the switches. The handle is actually very convenient. It is not a heavy device by any means but the handle really makes it simple to move around.  A cool feature is the base/stand. It allows tilting of the heater up or down as needed. Although it's not explained in the manual there is a little screw in the box. This screw goes into the side of the heater where it connects to the stand. It stops the heater from turning too far up or down. This isn't shown in the picture.  The casing is made of metal and so is the fan and stand. One great thing is that the case is always cool to the touch, even after hours of being on.  Operation: There are two dials, one for the 2 heat settings and fan-only mode, and the other which is a thermostat. The thermostat is a great idea, but unfortunately I had inconsistent results. Using my thermometer I would see how many degrees the temp would fall before it kicked on. Sometimes it would be perfect with only a degree or so before it turned on, and sometimes it takes about 5-6 degrees before it starts. A bit too much sometimes. I took one star off for this.  It has a light that comes on when the heater is plugged in, regardless of whether it is turned on. It also has a a caution light that comes on when it overheats maybe? This is not explained in the manual, but it has come on for me, oddly enough only when I turn the heater to fan mode and rarely at that.  This heater is not silent. You can easily hear it through walls and doors.  Overall I like this heater. It's small, and easily portable. It heats and maintains a mid-sized, insulated room pretty easily  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the thermostat issue and that I like my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Optimus-H-5210-Infrared-Quartz-Radiant-Heater/dp/B000GG8DWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Optimus H-5210 Infrared Quartz Radiant Heater</a>&nbsp;so much.

I have used other commercial brands of Plasma cutters, and this one works just as well as some that would have cost me 3X as much, or more.  I got mine in a 'lightning deal' for $340, and i cannot believe at how well it works.  It will cleanly cut 1/4 inch steel, with almost no slag if you watch your cutting speed.  I have cut 1/2 inch thick steel with it, a little faster than my acetylene torch, and with about the same slag.  Not too many years ago, that would have required a machine that cost upwards of $1500, amazing what technology is giving us.  Now, getting something that works, and at such a low price does require some compromises.  Here are the ones I have found: Ground cable - short.  Fortunately, the machine itself is easy to carry, making it easy to bring to your work. Torch/torch cable - this is of a decent usable length, but it is not nearly as stout as what you will find on a commercial grade cutter.  However, for the average user, who won't tug too hard on it when it snags on something, and takes a little care to keep it away from sharp edges and hot surfaces, it should hold up fine.  Remember, this is a machine meant for hours of use per week, not per day.  It quickly and easily connects to the cutter, so replacing it if it does cause problems should be quick and easy.  You can also remove it if you aren't going to use the cutter for a while, to reduce the risk of damage. No hose connections.  It does come with a little air filter/dryer, and a bracket to mount it on the back of the machine.  It even comes with a length of air hose, but there are no hose barbs to connect it.  There is one lone barb, that screws into the air inlet of the welder.  To use the filter/dryer, you need to get your own barbs.  I highly recommend you use the one they included, even if you already have a filter/dryer, because it also has a regulator built in, which is a great feature.  I set the regulator for the pressure I want, and put a quick-coupler barb on the inlet side, and whenever I want to use the cutter, I just hook it so my shop air, no need to turn it down at the compressor. Instructions, or rather, a major lack of instructions.  Fortunately, the cutter is built so that everything has a different connector, so the only way things can be hooked up, is the right way.  However, before you actually try to USE the machine, please go on Youtube or somewhere, and watch a couple instructional videos.  They give a couple pictures and tips for assembly, but nothing in terms of how to use it.  No tips on air pressure, heat setting, etc.  FWIW, I found that 20PSI works well with the lower part of fhe amp range for thin metal, gradually increasing pressure up to about 40 (working) by the time you get to the highest setting. Now, to the good, It WORKS, and works well,  In anything under 3/16 inch, if you get the heat and air settings right, there is almost no slag.  In sheet metal, it cuts like a hot knife through butter, if you will pardon the pun.  Above 1/8 inch, you need to slow down a little, to avoid slag, and above 1/4 inch, it will almost always produce a little, but it doesn't seem to be any worse than a regular torch, and cuts faster.  I have cut 1/2 inch, creeping along, and that is about the practical limit in steel.  You probably could go a little thicker if you had to, but you are getting into the 'cuts it if it has to' instead of 'cuts it like it wants to'.  A couple years ago I considered getting a plasma cutter, and the welding shop let me try one out, that seemed to have about the same capacity as this one does, and it cost right at $1500.  I know they came down in price, but it still seems like a real bargain.  I looked online, and this was listed as the 'best Plasma cutter under $500', After you end your cut, air will flow through the tip for a few seconds, this is normal, it cools the tip for longer life.  Also, if you have a wire brush handy, a quick swipe over the cutting tip while it is still hot removes some of the spatter from it, making the tip last longer. It seems well made, all the controls work smoothly and precisely, and the cooling fan has a nice smooth hum to it.  Light enough to carry in one hand, with a handle on top. I understand it comes wired for 240V, but can be run at 120V at reduced capacity.  If all I had were 120V outlets, I think it would be well worth it to wire in a 240V socket for this cutter.  Even doing thinner materials, it will cut much faster if you can use it to capacity. Lastly, if you are considering a plasma cutter, spend the extra $50 (or less) and get the one with the pilot arc feature (the 'P' in the LTP).  Cutters without the pilot arc require you to start the cutting arc, much the same way you strike an arc with a stick welder.  With the pilot arc, it 'sparks' to start the arc for you, so you never have to worry about touching the tip to your work, so the tips should last longer, while at the same time being much easier to use.  Also, there is a little guide included, that you install on the gun, that holds the tip at the proper distance from the work, and preventing touching the tip.  Works great on most any flat surface, and makes it that much easier to use.",Great bargain,1455667200,8.0,,barb guide capacity heat term shop consider come understand slow fine actually try one last problem get length many flow make different steel connection range fortunately seem bargain hook part turn control right reduce cut let far believe easy speed quickly videos couple almost strike highly butter would metal hook everything ago weld work easily remove build stick set meant without risk greatly go know give away hard much connect hum like extra could upwards week come connects spark cost hold normal nothing screw limit gun cleanly plasma technology long thick consider replace one term make inlet instruction stout worth pun knife remember preventing time remove spend give practical damage top etc also pressure decent material still wire proper edge regulator barb user per year install lone side cooling cool tip spatter require yet run take snag cause always low picture rather sheet nice compromise reliability assembly use hand work longer however recommend hour precisely cut amp average need think hot want welder bad whenever enough seem tip cable surface instructional pilot less find look nearly little fast thing grade fwiw back creep deal high distance torch/torch regular low good setting quick online use tug come major list watch get thick pardon compressor produce filter/dryer cutter brand start quick-coupler avoid touch lightning best work along life cutter acetylene setting well care arc smoothly air find usable gradually way smooth feature surface handy fhe impress brush socket inch something great please already amazing real mine connector handle lastly put somewhere include slag sharp go youtube probably reduce machine lack commercial price cannot torch bracket want thin light hold fan thinner even grind hose easy increase day second outlet require never bring short cut mount worry instead seem end make ltp wire flat get carry anything keep swipe

It doesn't function as smoothly as your wall switch dimmer, particularly in the low light range. One time I had set it to a lower light level and sat down across the room, and the light just went out. I had bought this because I was switching a 3-way table lamp to an LED bulb which I thought didn't come in a 3-way version. Then I discover they do, but at a dear price $25-$66.  So, if you want to wait 2-3 years till the price comes down as it has on ordinary LED's you won't have to buy the dimmer and go to the trouble of re-wiring it.  The LED 3-way and regular LED bulbs generally don't have the high end brightness of the 100-150 watts incandescents. Maybe that's yet to come, but for some reason, as the wattage goes up in LED bulbs, the price doubles.  Still, the declining prices and variety of LED bulbs in the last couple of years have sent consumers rushing to spend large amounts to convert to what appears to be the bulb of the future, for the next 30 years or so at least.  They are certainly a better quality light than the CFL's (compact fluorescents.) And, they don't contain mercury.  Oh, but some contain lead and arsenic. (CREE says theirs have no mercury or lead.) Still the LED's look like the energy saving answer and the light quality answer all in one.  But, who's to know if a different technology will come along in 10 years and we all (at great expense) convert once again.  The lighting companies must be loving this.","Consumer's dilemma, spending big bucks to save money",1391817600,,,know smoothly go maybe think wattage price save like who's appear expense level sit generally compact come room function convert next last least rush high wait certainly company ordinary great arsenic trouble light till different oh technology must go good range ok lamp watt that's one bulb wall future quality table answer cree consumer regular incandescents double low reason large couple energy bulb come price light want variety across lead version time cfl's switch spend decline particularly buy switch still work re-wiring discover love lead year dim brightness send buy contain mercury say led's fluorescent set yet along look dear end go low amount

The sizes of the various two-dimensional butterflies range from 3"" X 4"" down to 1"" X 1 "".  Unfortunately, the twelve 3-D decals - the flat measurement of all is  1 "" X 2 "" - are not nearly the quality of the two-dimensional decals.  The vivid jewel-tones are only on one side of the decal; the back of the wings is without color.  Further, the 3-D butterflies are made of a thin, plastic material that is somewhat brittle.  The wings break easily.  The 3-D butterflies look artificial and inexpensive.  Each of the 3-D butterflies attaches to a surface using only the butterfly's body - a "" X 1 "" strip of adhesive.  The two-dimensional RoomMates Butterfly Wall Decals' use is not limited to decorating walls. The decals are also a fun enhancement for application on wood, craft projects or painted children's furniture. I used the RoomMate Butterfly decals on a stepstool my spouse and I made for our granddaughter; we were not willing to spend over $100 for those available online.  Following initial construction, the pieces of the stepstool were sprayed with semi-gloss paint purchased from the big box hardware store. After sketching a background design, each drawing was transferred to the corresponding piece of the stepstool. Acrylic craft paint worked to complete each background. Once the paint had cured for several days, different RoomMates Butterfly Wall Decals were placed onto the appropriate scene. A coat of clear shellac, followed by a coat of polyurethane sealed the surfaces and protected the stickers. We did do a test, and the shellac/polyurethane coatings do not cause the decals to become gummy nor does the protective coating affect the decals' color. This method should also work well for children's painted furniture.  If you are careful when removing the decals from the backing, RoomMates Butterfly Peel & Stick Wall Decals are easy to use. Because of the size of some decals, it is easy to have a decal fold over on itself. Separating the decal can result in damage to that particular vehicle. When applying a decal, be sure to smooth it as you apply it; this prevents air bubbles from becoming trapped under the decal. If you are applying the RoomMates Transportation Butterfly Wall Decals to a rough surface, take care not to smooth too firmly or the texture may poke through the decal.  I was disappointed with my purchase of ""RoomMates ACC0003B3D Butterfly 3-D Wall Decals"".  The difference in the quality between the two-dimensional and 3-D decals was not expected from a RoomMates product.  I would rate the two-dimensional decals as a 5-star product, but would give the 3-D butterflies, at best, only 3-stars.",Lovely Two-Dimensiional Butterflies; 3-D Butterflies Were Disappointing ...,1393977600,2.0,,give texture wall shellac plastic realistic bubble air spouse butterfly lovely use quite onto work peel break somewhat acrylic become strip smooth decorate seal surface twelve separate prevents children's product sketch poke jewel-tones attache affect several gummy furniture roommate shellac/polyurethane take paint big granddaughter protective careful butterfly test sure color disappoint different initial surface project trap size range place unfortunately box firmly fun nearly adhesive coating protect rate one butterfly's appropriate wall application quality back decal make rough removing spray coating apply material decal follow polyurethane vehicle semi-gloss limited online use work corresponding day become transportation stepstool design thin draw two-dimensional result purchase purchase would spend particular roommate various method background damage also artificial inexpensive coat vivid complete measurement easily easy wood fold side paint willing scene care size construction piece stick best transfer without enhancement look back body wing flat craft sticker cause use well available hardware expect do cure apply difference piece may clear store brittle follow

I have always loved looking at NYC artwork and this vinyl poster caught my eye.  The poster arrived in a long mailing tube.  At first I thought the sticker was too large, but upon unrolling the sticker I realized that it was just a lot of excess backing to the sticker.  I prepped the area that it was to go on by wiping the area with a rag.  To make sure the sticker was level I went ahead and pre-marked some spots on my wall to make it easier to install.  Removing the sticker from the backing took some work and needed two people.  One to hold the poster up, and the other to remove the backing and press onto the wall and make sure there were no bubbles.  We did mess up a few times, but it was easy to remove from the wall and fix as many times as necessary.  The room I put this in is dark green, so the white window border popped.  I think this may look better in a white or light colored room, but it does what I wanted in that room.  I wouldn't call this a 3D print, but it is a unique piece of artwork.  The print was not the best quality.  Up-close I could notice banding from the printer and the pixels were blown up much more than the picture should be.  From far away it looks decent.  A few days after installing I noticed that the poster was starting to lift from the edges.  I usually go back and push it back into place without any issues but it is probably due to the room being very dusty and not doing a better job with prepping the wall.  Overall, I am happy with this NYC poster sticker and I like looking at it in my room.  I would recommend it to others that are interested in having a window to NYC in their room.

The storage tank has a tire pressure connection to check the air pressure in the bladder inside. Typically the pressure should be about 7 PSI. When I checked mine it was zero and I carefully inflated it with an air compressor but found the pressure would quickly leak out. I purchased the 4 gallon tank to replace my Kenmore (Sears) unit and it looked almost identical to the original unit and cost about 1/2 as much.  To replace it all you have to do is turn off the water to the RO unit, open the RO faucet and drain the pressure off until water stops coming out of your RO faucet (not the regular one), then simply unscrew the tubing connector from the top and thread it onto the replacement tank. Be sure you have some Teflon thread tape or other drinking water approved thread sealer. Be sure that you put a small pan under the tank or at least some towels because you are bound to get some leaking when you swap the tanks. If you put the Teflon tape on the connector before you put it under the sink, it is a lot easier to do.

Barcellos,"I used this to desolder all the switches from a mechanical keyboard PCB. That was 87 switches, with two solder joints per switch. There were also 4 RGB LED pins per switch. It worked fine on the larger, spaced out switch pins, but I gave up on trying to use this to desolder the tiny, cramped LED pins. I ended up just melting all four pins at once with the side of the iron and pulling out the LED while the solder was fluid.  It is kinda hard to operate. It doesn't always successfully suck up the solder, so I often have to try multiple times. The tip is made of plastic, so it frequently touches hot things and starts to melt and warp. As the plastic warps, it partially blocks the hole, which makes it harder to successfully suck up solder, and more likely to touch hot things and warp more. Sometimes the old sucked up solder doesn't come out when you plunge it, then it attaches to the joint you're trying to suck up, and you end up with more solder than you started with.  It is usually easier just to use desoldering braid, unless you have a very large, clean join with plenty of room around it. Then it works fine. If you have steadier hands than I do it might be easier for you to use this. I don't have shaky hands or anything, it just seems to require a lot of precision and coordination to get good results.  I can't complain too much for the price.

Great features and as good if not better than most (also considering bondwell @ costco but like feature set and brand reputation of Toto over wireless remote.  2)  Install - I am VERY experienced and have installed many sinks, faucets and toilets and have to say a) instructions are absolute useless - 3 English words followed by every foreign language and unsequenced diagrams is USELESS. They are better off doing what Ikea does and do step by step diagrams IN SEQUENCE and omit words altogether.  I too had leaks everywhere using the splitter.  Problem is that you must insert the included washer in the connector to tank and orig supply line BUT you must carefully tighten the splitter directly to the toilet tank.  The leak was not a problem metric vs. imperial parts, but that the splitter much attach to toilet tank VERY tight to prevent leak.  Obvious right?  Not so.  EVERY toilet tank hose connector I've seen is made of what plastic to be designed with a HAND turn NOT wrench since all toilet tank floats are plastic threaded and can easily strip if turned too tight.  NOT the toto splitter.  It is made using a metal NUT which requires a wrench to tighten - which if done too hard will spin toilet float and/or strip plastic threads but too loose causing leaks.  I had to stick my hand in tank and hold plastic valve while very carefully tightening metal nut on plastic screw.  A true balancing act but successful.  (tip - make sure the proprietary quick hose from washlet to slipper is inserted with a ""snap"" before tightening plastic hand nut else it will not seal properly)  Design - Warning. Even though I have ""elongated"" model for my ""elongated"" toilet, with the pump components in back of seat, your net toilet seat will become equivalent to a round bowl - a problem for some men when sitting.  Also like all other washlets, the seat sits very high at angle (no functional difference - just looks like you're going to slide off.  Toilet seat does seem a little flimzy and needs adjustments left/right after use but still better than house brand toilets from hd or lowes.  Features - Sprayers work great and offer lots of options.  But because of the shorter bowl length, I would have preferred greater adjustments fwd/bckwd of nozzle to accommodate the smaller toilet set, as I find myself having to scoot forward over seat to get proper spraying angle and I'm not that large of a guy.  The pre-mist features was one of the selling points, but a bit of a disappointment because it only wet a very small area at rear of tank.  Heater is fast and effective.  Blower was surprisingly effective but still need paper unless you have 3-5 min to sit and dry.  Controls are pretty good once you learn how to use.  For those complaining about fan noise pre/post sitting and seat warmer power consumption there at TONS of programming options you just have to dig through manual and learn.  Tech support - Called Toto tech support.  Tech I spoke to was knowledgable but somewhat condescending.  He did not have the patience to deal with my questions and grudgingly sent replacement part (backordered) just to get me off the phone rather than taking time to help me resolve problem.  I think Toto's biggest challenge is POOR install instructions and use of non-standard parts (metal connector to plastic tank screw).  Conclusion - I would NEVER think I would want a washlet, but after traveling 2 weeks in Japan where every toilet was a washlet, I can't see how anyone could do without - it's just uncivilized so glad to see American like me now catching on.  I am happy with my purchase so far and will update with extended use.",Great Toilet. Best Features vs. Price.

Inserting the hex bit into the slot pushed the entire shaft slightly inward.  This causes fatal misalignment of the hole of the inner shaft and the hole on the outside barrel, making insertion of the locking pin impossible..  There is no way to move the inner shaft back out to restore alignment.  Without the locking pin, the hinge is worthless.  Secondly, unlike spring hinges I've used, once the pin is inserted, the pin is so short that it becomes buried inside the barrel of the hinge. In contrast, the quality spring hinges I've brought a year ago has a slot that covers about 180 degree allowing movement of the pin..  This neat design allows progressive tightening, by a series of hex winding, removal and relocation of the pin.  Since springs will loosen from fatigue and age over time, a practical design must allow for occasional re-tightening.

As others have also indicated, using the toilet is usually a messy ordeal for me. I've known about bidet toilet seats for several years but assumed they were not very good. Thanks to online reviews, I did some research recently and, based on all the positive feedback for this and other brands, I decided to finally buy one. I chose this one because of the continuous warm water and the fact that it is higher pressure than some of the others. It is a godsend. No more need to take a shower or wash yourself ""down there"" afterwards. The water starts out lukewarm but very quickly - within a second or less - is at temp. The 2 minute wash time seems more than adequate to do the job but you can run it longer if necessary since this thing will not run out of warm water. The dryer does not get you completely dry but it does a pretty good job. I didn't think I needed the heated seat but it sure is nice to have! Very easy to install. My house is pretty new so the plumbing matched up well. When it arrived, I opened the box and thought to myself ""no way this only takes 30 minutes to install"".  But I got stared and actually did finish in about 30 minutes. The instructions are not super clear but easy enough. The water supply hose has a 90 degree connector on one end. Instructions don't tell you where to attach it. I tried it on the ""t"" and on the bidet seat. It seemed about the same either way so I attached it to the seat - a 90 degree connector on BOTH ends might have been nicer. I had to use an extension cord and was able to plug it into a GFI outlet. Will get the electrician to install an outlet next to the toilet. I've only had this 4 days and I do not want to be without it. I am a single male - my family and friends may think I'm nuts when they find out I have this (it is in the master bath so most folks will never know) but I really don't care. If none of them have the same problems as I have, they will never understand anyway. A true bidet is nice but this is much better. Nothing you need to do except push some buttons on a remote.

Obviously, at 250W per fixture, they are energy hogs. But we haven't wanted to give up their dimming feature, so until now we've stuck with the halogens. We were excited to see dimmable GU10 LED bulbs finally arrive on the market, so we ordered several types for comparison (these, Lighting EVER Dimmable 7W GU10 LED Bulb, 360lm, Warm White; JACKYLED LED Gu10 9W Dimmable Warm 50W Equivalent 60 Degree Gu10 Bulbs, and Triangle Bulbs 55961 LED 6-watt Dimmable GU10 MR16 60-Degree bulbs, which were completely identical to the JACKYLED bulbs to our eyes.   The 7W Lighting Ever bulb performed best by far in our downward-facing, open fixture. What distinguished it from the others was that it gave off a uniform, bright light in which individual LED elements were not visible. We liked the color of light, the quick response time, and the silent dimming, but these features were true of all the bulbs.   The HitLights bulb gave off bright, pleasing light and easily came in second, but for our use, in which one looks directly at the face the bulb, the obvious individual elements were a deal-breaker. They're just too industrial-looking, and/or too direct about ""Look! We're using LEDs!"" In a fixture in which one did not look directly at the face the bulb, this  bulb might be fine.   None of the bulbs were as good the halogens. None gave off light that extended above the end of the bulb, as the halogens can, so with any these LEDs we'll have a dark section above each bulb. And none dimmed as fully as the halogens.

It took about 12 hours to do everything.  It was a lot of steps and a lot of work, but I think Chamberlain did a very good job on the instructions -- I would rate the clarity of the instructions an 8, and the overall design for install-ability a 9.  There were only a couple of things which I didn't think were really good enough in this system.  First, the mounting brackets are thin and flimsy.  I went to the local hardware store and bought a much sturdier slotted angle bracket and am much happier with the stability of the installed unit than I was with the bracket included.  Second, the insulated staples we made of nice copper wire, but the insulation was really lame.  It got the job done, but it sure seemed of poor quality compared to everything else.  I can't imagine why they would go el cheap-o on such an insignificant cost item.  Both these items are ancillary items so its really a nit.  I was pleasantly surprised that each of the remotes came with batteries and pre-programmed.  At the end of a 12-hour install I was so glad I could simply push those buttons and, voila!, everything worked.  One thing to mention about the light bulbs... the instructions say not to use LED bulbs for fear it might interfere with the radio signal for the remote controls.  I had a couple 40 watt bulbs in my unit and they were getting quite hot, but they were very dim.  So I tried using some of the Home Depot special LED bulbs and the remote controls work very well from as far away as I can imagine using them.  The bulbs are Philips 60W Equivalent LED Bulb Part # 9290011350  Overall, I am very happy.  I would not be happy if I spent 12 hours installing this unit and felt it was of poor quality.

Some people complain that high water pressure produces a very strong water stream that is somewhat painful (if you turn it up all the way). I did not have that problem. If you do have very high water pressure, you should probably consider purchasing the flow limiter valve from Amazon (http://smile.amazon.com/T-adapter-Shut-off-Connector-Chrome-Finish/dp/B00FPYIK6M/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_text_z) or the manufacturer's web site.  Also, the unit does cause the toilet seat to be angled a little. For some people, this may not be comfortable. You can purchase ""bumpers"" to raise the front and level the seat.

(This concept is foreign to me, as I'd expect there to be some standards in terms of the sizes of the same type of bulb.) At any rate, the first set I got didn't fit the enclosure. I found these online paying attention to the length of the bulb from the two silver leads to the bulb cover on the other end and it seemed to be short enough to fit the enclosure. What was nice is that these are 50W replacements but use only 7W. That's fantastic -- 1/5 of the power consumption of my existing bulbs, but 43% brighter! The problem was that despite the length being okay, the bulbs still didn't fit the enclosure because the bulge is a but too fat at the top (the part connecting to those two metal leads).

Denyer,"I originally bought this model based on the recommendation in the July 2005 issue of Fine Homebuilding magazine, listed as a ""dependable tester.""  I've had difficulty with multimeters in the past, but never with a Fluke brand multimeter.  I've droped Flukes down ladders, on concrete, and they still work like a champ.  They work so well and are so trusted, it's the only brand of test equipment that the U.S. military does NOT require to have regular calibrations (though Fluke does recommend an annual calibration.)  Pros:  -  The best feature (for me) is that the test lead can be plugged into the back of the unit and used like a big handle.  This means that you can hold the Fluke in one hand with the hot lead sticking out the ""jaw"" end while your other hand holds the other lead in place.  No more trying to find a place for the meter to sit.  -  ""Slim Reach"" probe tips (4mm) are flattened to allow tips to be easily inserted into outlets.  Still round, but have flat sides to them.  Tips are replaceable.  -  Leads stow in the back of the meter.  -  Audible continuity beeper is plenty loud.  I've been able to hear it over engine noise.  -  The ""automatic"" and ""auto-select"" features are quick.  Simply select volts, stick your probes, and you have a reading within a couple seconds.  -  Dust and water ""resistant.""  (I wouldn't go swimming with it or anything.)  -  Has a ""low battery"" indicator.  -  2-year warranty.  Save that receipt!  Cons:  -  Pricey, when compared to other brands.  But, I feel the quality speaks for itself here.  - Made in China (for those of you that want to know.)  Specifications:  Precise digital resolution to 0.1 amp, 1 ohm, and 1 volt (AC/DC.)

The new countertops were installed by a local company, however, I installed this sink (I gave the granite company the measurements for this sink so they could make a cut out).  This Swanstone sink was easy to install, but the plumbing was rather complicated as always, so I would recommend having a professional do it.  This sink is, without a doubt, my favorite kitchen sink ever I ever had.  The bowls are pretty deep and it is just a big sink in general.  The nero color is very nice!  Since the granite we got installed is black with specs of other colors, the sink matches very well.  I think a straight black sink would a little funny with granite like that.  The nero color is basically a dull shade of black/dark grey.  The stone this sink is made out of makes it seem durable and appealing.  We got a nice Delta faucet from Lowe's.  It is a great match for this sink, but it is expensive.  But if you can afford this sink, then you can probably afford a nice faucet.

Well, I sort of did.  I bought this not from Amazon but from CPO Skil as a recon; the saw is great.  BUT.  the foot when set at the 0 degree detent is not exactly 90 degrees to the blade, and there's no adjustment.  The Bosch 1677M which is the new and updated version of this same saw includes among other improvements a foot assembly with a fine tuning adjustment for just this issue.  The good news for me is that I can buy the Bosch replacement foot for less than the cost difference between what I paid for my recon Skil and a new Bosch saw, and the part numbers for the two case pieces are identical so it should be compatible; however, if buying new, I would highly recommend going with the Bosch 1677M just for that one refinement alone.  Yes I know that it is a framing saw but there's no reason that a tool of this quality AND PRICE shouldn't be able to be set up to produce exactly square cuts without fiddling around with fine setup - if there's a 0 degree detent, it should be able to be adjusted so that the detent is at zero degrees plus or minus a fraction of a degree. The Skil is not capable of this out of the box; the Bosch is.  'nuff said.  This isn't a *bad* saw...  but the Bosch is a refinement of this same design (Bosch owns the Skil name now.  I'm not sure why there's differences between the Bosch saw and the Skil - you'd think that they would have discontinued one, and/or applied improvements equally to both.  But they didn't, and the Bosch in my opinion is the superior product, even taking into account that the Bosch is typically slightly more expensive most places that you look.)",great saw but buy the Bosch 1677M instead,1312156800,13.0,,know compatible nuff recon and/or assembly foot update say however recommend news among take fine product think expensive cost high replacement name frame buying sure great discontinue slightly equally blade want superior adjusted tune less box applied place tool refinement one square part new issue quality setup degree account number wrong yes reason go able good amazon design price fiddle own cpo detent version alone zero highly sort get difference would bosch degree buy produce bad contractor figure even adjustment typically opinion fraction buy identical case plus cut i'm around minus saw skil set two classic without look include capable handheld there's go circular use well pay base exactly difference piece improvement

While they are great, as evidenced by my buying 3 times, they do have their drawbacks and I will try to prepare you if you are interested in buying them.  1 - They are really bright and don't take a lot of wattage so they are perfect for most outdoor applications. The light is sealed and supposedly will last many thousands of hours so I am looking forward to longevity. I have six on one line and four on another and they distribute and even level of brightness. I replaced some halogen bulbs with these because the halogens were bright close to the transformer and dim farthest away way. That problem has now been solved. 2- A converter from AC to DC was not needed as they do not pulse with the AC line voltage. I returned them and that saved me $40. 3- Now for the reasons I only gave it four stars out of five: Of the 10, 3 of the bases required lock washers as the threads were stripped in the base and would not screw down all the way, not a big problem. The bases and brackets could be of heavier metal as I bent two of them in the ground in our Georgia Clay. All I did was re-bend them back in shape but they were nowhere near the gauge of the metal of the previous ones I used. I would gladly pay more to have heavier metal. Now the worst part  making a connection to the supply wire was a disaster. I bought the Moonrays 11604 cable connectors as recommended, but the soldering was a real pain and had to be redone on a couple cases. I found the prongs which perforate the existing wire to be pretty cheap also and they bent down all the way a few times, which required rebending. Not a good option.  I wound up using the old connectors from the halogen lamps which required ring lugs to be soldered then screwed. Yet again, a lot of work but the metal to connect the wire was strong but I couldn't find replacements on the web. I just bought some Malibu 8101- 4802 low-voltage wire connectors which come 2 to a pack and they are highly rated. I believe this will solve the problem of connecting these lamps to the wire and purchased some however, I have not tried them to date but they look good. All in all, I love these lamps, especially the price, although they could charge more for a heavier metal solution, imho.

There seemed to be an interested battle between the overseas Cree brand and the Coast brand so I ordered one of each and compared them side-by-side.  On Amazon, the CREE ULTRAFIRE XD-68s sells for less than half the price of the COAST HP1 at 3.99 and 9.99 respectively.  Both are single state (full on) flashlights in a black, metal housing.  Both will fit in your pocket. Both have identical clips. The Coast is a half-inch longer and a little slimmer than the more heavily styled Cree. The styling reference is entirely subjective so I leave that to you. I prefer (slightly) the Coast.  The light color from the Coast is cooler (bluer) than the CREE which is warmer (orange tint) but neither is extreme and you'd be hard pressed to say which was which unless they were seen side-by-side.  Construction seems to be very good for both. Switch is solid.  Adjustable focus: The Coast will focus much wider than the Cree. The Cree will focus much more narrow (so narrow that you can focus it such that the projected light retains the image of the internal LED!) They appear to put out about the same amount of light, they just disperse it differently. In normal mid-range focus, the Cree's light is more evenly dispersed whereas the Coast is brighter in the middle than the rest of the field of view. Either way could be seen as better. It's up to you.  Cree takes a little longer to ship as it ships from overseas.  The Coast line is much more costly, and the HP1 that I'm comparing here is by far the least expensive of the Coast line. Others models are MUCH more expensive. This appears to be the entry-level Coast light, but is still 2.5X more than the Cree.  You might be tempted to buy the Coast because of the name. Frankly, I hadn't heard of it before so it holds no sway with me, but of all the differences between these two, there is not one difference in quality or features that clearly stands out as better or worse... other than the price.  The decision will be your own personal preference. I think I like the minimalistic styling of the Coast a little better, but the Cree because has an incredible price and I like the more even dispersal pattern.  So, comparison aside, the Coast is an excellent pocket flashlight at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it. But if you want to save some money, check out the Cree as it is a very formidable competitor.",Excellent light - but is it the best buy?,1411948800,,,ship hard evenly black minimalistic clearly much view amount pattern cree's longer entry-level way disperse sell like stand reasonable warmer appear ordered decision recommend prefer could sway heard half might frankly respectively image expensive think others normal differently least dispersal bad name flashlight compare seem overseas solid slightly color state money interested clip well less middle tempt seem preference line formidable brand put little see neither one entirely model cooler quality aside retain cree compare far ship good single subjective fit style amazon dispersed price light want side-by-side full housing tint lead highly switch focus difference bluer metal coast hold check buy narrow wider still even reference mid-range battle leave press rest heavily incredible brighter ultrafire identical project either adjustable field construction appear whereas half-inch costly i'm pocket two flashlight competitor orange excellent take comparison extreme say save difference internal personal style unless feature slimmer

The included CFL bulbs lightly flickered even though the light was switched off with the remote control unit I installed with the fan. The CFLs weren't dimmable either. I first tried 3 incandescent bulbs which solved the problem. However I have long ago given up on incandescent bulbs in the house (which is why I had some in the storage cabinet as they had been replaced with LEDs). So having solved the flicker problem I now wanted to get some LED bulbs installed to see if they would also work well.  I was willing to buy a new remote control module if that was necessary to make the LED bulbs work without buzzing, and for them to dim properly. But that wasn't necessary.  I bought the three Cree bulbs, put them in the ceiling fan, and they just worked. They dim, and there is no buzzing or other artifacts. They just work. I'm very pleased. I have many LED bulbs in the house, many of them Cree. Some of them buzz, even if slightly. These new bulbs are great. The fan remote was purchased when we had nothing but incandescent bulbs available so it isn't optimized for LED bulbs.  The unit price for the package of 8 here on Amazon is much less expensive than the unit price I paid at Home Depot.  The only downside is they don't dim as far as incandescent bulbs, and as they dim they lose their white color and are more on the brown side. Neither of these things bother me so I won't take off any stars in my review. I find that almost all LED dimmable bulbs are just like these in behavior.","They just work.

Their design is really good, along with very simple installation design. They make it easy to install.  Better than many of the competing brands. However, there is one fatal flaw in this faucet, and perhaps others on the market. There are water flow-restrictors inside the main hose. After I installed it according to all the instructions, I turned on the faucet only to see nothing better than a good trickle of water. I asked the customer if they have low water pressure? They answered NO, our pressure is great! I double checked all hoses, rechecked the fittings to see they weren't over tight. No change.  Next, I called customer service and after trouble-shooting over the phone for 10 minutes, the woman said she too was stumped, and offered to send a replacement. I said; no thanks, since that would take 7 days to arrive, and I could return it to Home Depot in 15 minutes. But I hadn't given up yet.  I looked over all the hoses and connections for a solution. It got narrowed down to one connection. The faucet wand connector hose has a white quick-release clip on it. I disconnected it from under the sink and then unscrewed it from it's hose connection. The white plastic piece had parts inside, so I unscrewed this part and used a small screwdriver to get out the first two pieces. They were blue one-way flow valve parts, and I wondered if they could be the issue. But there was still one more small piece inside the white plastic housing. I tried to blow air through this housing and could barely get enough air through it to amount to a small fa*t. It was pathetic. Using a chopstick, I pushed it out of the tube. Then I replaced the other two blue one-way flow valve parts, and reassembled it all. Voila. The faucet now works perfectly, like it should have out of the box.  There were no visible signs of anything blocking this little part I removed. Nothing at all. This was simply in place to restrict the water flow. Perhaps according to some Federal standard for water conservation. But this was extreme, and if not remedied, would have meant a product return along with a really negative review. As it stands, I give Kohler a huge thumbs up for making the part in a fashion that allowed the buyer to unscrew it and remove the restrictor. The flow now is what most would consider normal. It is not Huge flow, just normal flow. We will never see Huge flow with the design of the faucets today. But you must remove this part in order to gain normal flow.  I've attached a photo to show you this part I removed.  I hope this helps you all in your decision to purchase a new faucet.","Great faucet, easy to install, and great water flow after you remove the flow restrictor!",1483747200,33.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719syFsHt6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71meMjLNnCL._SY88.jpg']",give sign send phone plastic air negative amount i've gain pathetic double customer like purchase stand order say woman connection decision however service thanks fa*t visible market could solution accord simply conservation product buyer thumbs others federal next normal turn tight clip get nothing replacement many name enough barely blow flow change trickle reason take wand today great make simple ask minute connection must quick-release fatal connector well restrictor box look huge answer hope little really one part new issue remedied checked place low help wonder installation arrive good home consider chopstick hose allow instruction use perfectly day kitchen first customer's design valve housing perhaps compete get would narrow block one-way blue part depot white standard pressure restrict flow-restrictors still voila stumped work see water brand faucet inside hose easy sink remove fashion choose install rechecked make screwdriver disconnect main photo unscrew never push review piece reassemble since two yet along meant try attach call flaw tube return instal trouble-shooting use kohler extreme offer remove show piece anything faucet give fitting unscrew small review replace

Another issue is that the light emitted is very cold toned, almost blueish. And, last but not least, the sensors are not terribly sensitive. The ambient light in the room has to be rather strong before the lights will turn off. In fact, in some rooms when we tried these night lights, even turning on the regular light in the room would not turn off the night light. So, OK for a garage, not so good for a bedroom or other living space.

These are really easy to install and put out nice light.  I really like that they don't have to ""warm up"" like the normal flourescent lights do.  A nice thing about these lights is that you can use them without having to re-wire the fixture.  I have some other LED tube bulbs and to use them, you have to do a fairly significant amount of rewiring. I used to work as a general contractor on commercial buildings, so I'm pretty familiar with electrical work.  But those other lights took some research to figure out exactly how to do them.  I was happy with the results of those other ones, but it was a pain.  These ones you just plug in and replace the old bulbs. Super easy.  They put out a nice light, though it is a directional light so make sure you check that they will work for your application.  I guess the only problem with these bulbs is if you have a bad ballast that is causing the problems with the old lights, popping these in wont' fix that.  They need a good ballast.  If you have to replace the ballast, it might be easier to just replace the whole fixture with something new or even to go through the hassle of using the non-ballast bulbs like I mentioned above.  Also, make sure you want a really white light.  The listing says 5500k, but these seem closer to 6500k for color temperature.  They are probably closer to ""daylight"" color than they are to the warm white from a traditional bulb.

HITS * The soft close feature works great for all 3 components (main seat, little seat, lid) * Everything lines up properly, the install looks good * The kids are excited about the light (for now, anyway--that should wear off soon) * The smaller seat is a good size for potty-training sized bottoms * The smaller seat is easy to get in and out, but is secure during use. It also doesn't interfere when using the larger seat.  MISSES * The seat came with some fancy looking hardware (compared to the plastic bolt and nut that the old seat was using).  This was supposed to make it adjustable and easy to install, but quite frankly, I found it a bit difficult to work with.  Too hard? No, but there was a bit of finagling required to get it all set correctly. * Mine came damaged in 2 places.  Neither are visible unless you lift the seat all the way, but there must have been some manhandling in transit or something...  Fortunately, Amazon has an excellent return policy. * The light is strictly on a timer: 9 hours on, 15 hours off.  The timer starts when you put the battery in, which means you must put the battery in at the right time of day if you want it to work properly  I think my favorite aspect of this is the smaller seat for little kids.

I could not care less if the stitching was not straight as you see in some tarps, it could zig-zag back and forth as far as I am concerned, as long as it held together.  However, that is not the case with this tarpaulin from Chicago Canvas.  Upon receiving this tarp, I unfolded it and found that in many places the stitching is simply nonexistant.  There are large runs where the stitching stops and the string is simply laying on top of the canvas until it picks back up again.  The second thing I noticed when I unfolded the tarp was a bunch of grommets falling to the ground and empty holes along the edge of the canvas.  In addition, the grommets that were still in place could literally be removed by a simple tug of the finger.  In order to make this ""Tarpaulin"" work,  I had to purchase two separate orders of replacement grommets, the tools needed to install them, and the time to do it.  Further, I then had to have the tarp sown together in all areas where the stitching was missing.

Since I already have an outdoor faucet down in the garden that is part of the irrigation side of the shutoff valve, I can easily attach this adapter and use my compressor to blow out my sprinklers. Note that if you don't have a faucet on the sprinkler side, you can get parts at a hardware store to fit this adapter onto one of the sprinkler feeders itself, but you will need a way to force that valve open all the time during blow-out. This is not something most sprinkler controllers let you do.  Note that you do NOT want to use this on a regular outdoor faucet on the house side of the shutoff valve!  Steps to use this:  1. Shut off the main sprinkler valve. This is probably at the street near your meter. 2. Open the outdoor faucet and let as much water drain out by gravity as possible 3. Attach this adapter, and then attach the compressor to it 4. Start up the compressor and let it charge the tank. 5. One by one, go through and open each sprinkler zone valve and let it run until it's just blowing air 6. When you're done, close the faucet  Note that you will need a ""real"" compressor for this.

The biggest problem is they are hard to use. I control it with Siri, but she doesn't work from your pocket. I have to actually take the phone out of my pocket and say Hey Siri, and sometimes I have to repeat myself once or twice. This would probably work better with an Alexa. The proximity sensor for leaving the house is very nice.  The bulbs are buggy. Sometimes when I turn on a group, one light comes on dimmer than the rest, and I have to individually turn it up.  The primary reason I bought these is for the integration with Sleep Cycle app. But the huge limitation is you cannot change the color while they are turned off. So this means after going to bed with a warm evening light, I have to write a custom API app to turn them on in the morning to minimum brightness, change the color to cool, then turn it off. Then Sleep Cycle does it's thing and wakes me up with a nice fade in. Even after writing this custom app, it's a nuisance because I have to  set its wakeup time every night to match Sleep Cycle. So now I essentially have to set two alarm clocks.  I want these lights to change temperature throughout the day, regardless of whether they are on or off. Then next time I turn them on it should be the appropriate temperature. But this is sadly not possible through the Hue API.  When these lights are on in the day, I expected them to look similar to sunligh, but it's actually far from it. I have tried all the different colors, and around 180 mireds (5600K) is the closest, but compared to sunlight it looks dingy and the colors are a little weird.

This is the first time I have heard or seen the ""push pull rotate"" technology and I have to say it is pretty cool. I replaced an existing internal door knob and the Brinks one fit perfectly into the cutouts; there are instructions for installing in a door without the pre-cuts.  I have replaced plenty of door knobs in my life and one of the most frustrating things I have encountered are the ones where you painstakingly have to get the screws just right when putting the 2nd half together with the 1st. You actually screw the pieces together before the 2nd knob is installed.  Sweet!  I would like to point out that this knob is for interior doors, not exterior ones.  It has a slot on the outer portion which allows you to unlock it if needed; you can use a coin or similar item instead of having to hunt down those little metal rods and push through the hole, also a great feature.  The push pull rotate feature works very smoothly and is great if your hands are full - you can just bump it with your hip to open. If someone has difficulty in turning a knob, then the pull functionality is also a wonderful feature. And it only makes sense that the knob can also be turned, as it does take a while to get used to opening a door differently!  The door knob is high quality and the brushed satin nickel is more elegant than I expected. It is larger than your standard door knob due to the mechanics for the push/pull ability and that takes a little getting used to. It seems the best application for this type of door knob would be children's rooms, laundry rooms, and bathrooms. You could use it on a door coming from your garage as well, since that is a place you frequently go through with your hands full, but I would not use it in that application for security reasons. If someone can get in my garage, I do not want them to have the ability to get into my house without having an additional barrier (locks) on the internal door as well.  Overall, this knob is high quality and the push pull rotate features are quite innovative.

I have owned Buck, Schrade Walden, Old Timer, Spyderco, Mtech, Kershar, Case XX, Frost Cutlery. Mora, Condor, Browning folder, and many many more.  This OSO sweet knife by Kershaw I LOVE!  Let's take it from the top.  The knife is designed by Ken Onion with his Speed Safe opening assist technology.  The blade steel in 8cr13MoV Chinese stainless steel. I prefer to call rust resistant because almost any steel will rust if you do not care for it properly.  The handle scales are glass filled nylon. The liners are stainless steel. One side has been skeletonized to save weight.  Yes it is Chinese stainless steel but it holds a decent edge  This knife gives you a big 3 1/4.inch (82.5 mm) blade.  What is amazing this knife only weighs 2,92 OZs (83.2 grams). What blew my mind is the spine of the OSO Sweet knife is a full 1/8 inch (3.5 mm) thick with sharp 90 degree corners.  The ergonomics on this knife is amazing. The shape fits my hand as if it was dedigned for me.  This knife is easily rugged to be your EDC. I carry this knife every single day. After I received my first OSO Sweet knife; I liked it enough to buy another OSO Sweet knife. It is my favorite knife out of all of the knives I have owned during the past 49 years.  I have two minor nitpicks.  1. The back spacer. Stand offs would hand been better to prevent gathering pocket lint.  2. There is no jimping for the thumb ramp.  If the blade was 01 tool steel, standoffs instead of a back spacer, and jimping on the thumb ramp; you would have an incredible knife that would sell for $150+.  Considering I got two of these on eBay for $39.92 ($19.96 each) with shipping included; I am certainly not singing the blues!  I got the deal of the century !

I was suprised to find out that this knife is $40 becaus in my opinion there are far superior knives in that range of money. I'd suggest checking out the Spyderco Ambitious, Soyderco Persistance, and Spyderco Tenacious, I belive all three are superior to this knife, far better steel, easier to grip, better lockup and more capability.  Extensive Review: The lock up is good up and down but a little loose left and right even with not much use. There is almost no grip on this knife. It would be impossible to use with gloves. I liked the look of this knife when I bought it, its very forward blade shape makes for an aggressive look. The pocket clip is average and will do the job, but with only average retention. The deployment on this blade is interesting, the thumbstud is useless and even a knife collector such as myself has some trouble using it to deploy the knife. However, the flipper is very strong and the blade comes out with a lot of force.  Overall I think that there are much better knives in the $40 range than this one - you aren't getting the most bang for your buck with this knife. (See above for better knives in my opinion.) I have trouble finding a use for this knife due to its lack of grip, it mostly just sits around in my collection while better knived get used for edc.

The gun comes with many heads which can be very useful depending on the type of work that you are trying to complete. The gun itself has 3 modes, Low, Off, and High. I have not personally done a read on the temperature the gun produces but I know it has been spot on for my needs thus far. I have used it for everything from, drying quick-set compound for a wall repair, removing graffiti film and adhesive, to using it on shrink wrap for wire leads, and much more. The plastic casing of the unit does really well at keeping the heat away from you and you can set it on the side without the metal barrel touching anything and possibly doing damage. I can not lie and say that the gun feels high quality because it doesn't, it feels more like a toy or cheap blow dryer in hand. That being said I will say that it does the job very well, is light weight, gets incredibly hot and works better than some more expensive units I have used.

I will say this system clamps things together beautifully. My largest clamps are only 3 foot and having to buy 8 x 48 inch clamps at about 30$ a piece would come to about 240$ just to properly hold my table top together as the glue dried. This effectively saved me about 150$ just in that one instance. Not to mention I was able to immediately raise the table top and move it where I wanted it.  The cherry table top is dense and its size 36x72 as listed in the Kreg directions (every 6 inches) requires 11 holes per board which comes to 44 holes. For ease of use I just went to punch them all out in one sitting rather than stopping to glue and screw. On the second board (11 consecutive holes) the bit started to feel snug in the metal sleeve as if heat from the constant friction was causing things to expand and seize up. Naturally to seat the bit properly I spun up the drill a bit and just kept powering through. It wasn't Until I was through that second board (22 holes) that I flipped the jig over and noticed a fracture in the blue plastic that held the metal sleeve in place... which was now about a centimeter or 2 recessed into the jig. I simply switched to the second hole for the rest of the 22 holes and although I experienced the same slight binding of the drill bit I was able to finish without incident. Keep in Mind I was not putting pressure on the drill I was letting it walk itself into the wood as this was my first experience with this Jig so I was being as delicate as possible.  Needless to say I am having Amazon replace the jig and I will see how the second jig works for the skirt and legs of the table putting it through the same stress test.  *UPDATE* The replacement jig worked perfectly for the next 40 or so holes. Again this jig is what everyone makes it out to be.

As a remodeling contractor I am very hard on tools and this saw can take the abuse.  I have owned several other circular saws and this is easily my favorite.  I also have the Porter Cable blade on left which I have used the last 3 years. I like the Porter Cable and I love the visibility of the blade on left, but it always feels out of balance in my hand since I am right-handed, and when setting up cuts you often find that the majority of the saw's shoe and weight is being supported by the off cut side, because the blade on left is meant for left handers.  The Milwaukee 6390 has solved this problem.  It is extremely well balanced and the design of the blade opening in the shoe allows for excellent visibility of the cut line from above the saw. As a right hander you do not need to lean over the saw to see your cut line. Some guys are in such a habit of doing just that, and it is a hard habit to break.  I have pointed out to them how you can easily see the cut line from above and they always comment on how great that is.  The bevel adjustment handle is large and sturdy and easy to adjust.  Bevel cuts on this saw are the best I have ever experienced.  It will cut bevels up to 51 degrees or so like butter.  No bogging or binding whatsoever.  Two minor complaints that Milwaukee should address is that the shoe has a little bump on the edge at each corner, so that if you are using a straight edge like a speed square as a cutting guide, those little bumps will cause you to not get a perfectly square cut. To solve this I just filed them off. The other thing is that I did not like the thin kerf blade that came with the saw.  I put on a heavy duty carbide framing blade and the saw cuts much smoother, and quieter.  I get perfectly square cuts now, and this thing will go through a stud so smoothly it feels like 1 X .  Despite its minor flaws the Milwaukee is still deserving of 5 stars especially when you start comparing other saws.  The Porter Cable is a close second in my book, but the combination of balance, power, control, and adjustments of the Milwaukee make it my top choice.  Highly recommend.",Excellent Saw!,1105660800,24.0,,handers smoothly second porter duty guide hard power month much hand i've find habit bevel break extremely like come lean ever recommend cut powerful straight abuse edge file need guy saw's deserve last impressed contractor book get solve bogging several favorite sturdy experience thing open frame compare take problem great feel quieter cable blade visibility leave balanced handle line put right-handed little star minor one square point complaint balance love despite tool bevel degree right bump cut own set speed use large perfectly support design solve weight thin hander butter bind highly flaws especially top comment corner also close still see start adjustment easily easy year kerf majority smooth side adjustment make choice cut carbide since saw best combination two often saws meant whatsoever excellent address stud allow adjust tough cause circular well use heavy go always remodel bump shoe control milwaukee

We've been using this night light now for three months and I'm happy to report that it's still working like new. I wish I had something like this when I was a kid! Our granddaughter absolutely loves this thing!  I especially like that it automatically turns off one hour after turning it on (when using it without audio) so it's perfect for bedtime.  I wouldn't recommend buying this for the sound but personally thought of that as an added bonus. I'm not taking away a star because we love it and don't use it for stereo purposes but rather just for the night light.  Our granddaughter hasn't once asked for milk or any other random excuses to avoid going to bed, since we first used this. She actually happily goes to bed now, lol. That in itself makes this thing worth recommending!  The box it arrives in is sufficient for gift giving and I think any child or parent would love to receive this. For the current price, I think this is a worthwhile purchase.  Pictures can say much more than my words can with this product so I'm uploading some for you to see.

The drill has gobs of power, that are perfectly controlled with the smoothest power transfer of any drill I've ever owned. Not to mention it is two inches shorter than my Bosch 12 volt battery powered right angle drill with a hand Chuck. Granted these are completely different tools for different purposes, but this right angle drill should almost be on display in your Workshop. The Chuck has amazing grip on drill bits, which I use this drill with reverse cut drill bits for extracting bolts and rethreading holes. The motor power is phenomenal. It is very well controlled does not jerk in your hand and has a throttle limiter on the trigger so you don't use too much throttle while you are trying to maintain a good grip on the drill.  As you can see from the pictures, the space in which I drill is very limited. I wish this was the first right angle drill I purchased. It is far superior than the corded DeWalt that is also on the market. I do not have pictures of the DeWalt, sorry. For my purposes, having the power and smooth motor operation of the corded drill is excellent. The battery power, even the Milwalkee 12-volt is not well suited for this type of drill and tapping work. This drill has a mostly covered Chuck, which allows you to use your opposite hand to apply pressure from the back of the drill without chewing up your hand, or getting your glove stuck in the rotating Chuck. Also, not having a hand Chuck  reduces the overall length of the drill to fit into smaller spaces, and also allows a firm grip on the drill bit which will never rotate in the chuck,  like drill bits have a tendency to do in hand chucks.

Like most LED lights of this wavelength, the beam is fairly visible.  That's due to the spectral width of the diodes' main peak, and the response of the human eye's S receptors (blue cones), which can extend down to 385 nM.  In addition, almost all ""near-UV LEDs have a low intensity, broad secondary spectral peak at 525 nm that causes the beam to be quite visible.  If some visible output does not cause problems in your application, this long-wavelength UV source is very usable.  It has a well made, ""O-ring"" sealed, machined and anodized case, a 3AAA battery holder that's easy and obvious to load and 21 bright LEDs.  With any high-output UV light source, you should never look directly into the beam.  Unfortunately, this source does not come with any instructions or cautions about looking directly into the LEDs without suitable eye protection.

They also must be handled, charged and stored differently than any previous battery type, and pose a potential fire hazard unlike any we've seen before.  In addition to inserting the batteries in a LiPo charging bag, I thought it a good idea to charge the batteries in a fire resistant box to minimize the potential fire hazard associated with charging LiPos.  This box fits several batteries during charging, and increases my comfort level in the process.  To feed the wires into the box with the lid closed, I cut a small groove in the box lip and upper edge, and lay the charger wiring in it before closing the lid.  EDITORIAL NOTE - Persons new to LiPo batteries are well served to do a web search for ""LiPo battery safety"" and ""LiPo battery charging"" as well as the RC modeling forums and websites.  Spending a couple of hours understanding this new technology will minimize fire danger and money lost from inadvertently ruining batteries. Before the Chicken Little scaremongers crank up their regulatory machinery to protect us from the ""threat"" of LiPo batteries, they should be aware that RC modelers are familiar with fire safety, having safely bought, stored and used flammable liquids for decades, so education is the answer, not unwitting regulation of a new source of RC power.",Useful for improving RC Model LiPo battery charging safety,1402963200,,,inadvertently power closing protect radio think threat flammable hazard lipo fire modeler spend charger hour lip education level edge comfort search ruin battery differently close we've several minimize upper lipos wire revolutionize addition liquid groove must technology money source unwitting box unlike scaremonger little electronics charge see decade bag new danger answer rc cut forum increase good associate lose serve crank type chicken use charge couple safely fee safety person wire insert handle fit familiar also potential editorial pose lid modeling regulation websites lay aware idea machinery buy process regulatory previous store battery resistant web well charge note hobby understand small control

I wanted to wait a good bit of time before writing a review. It is now February, 2016 (approximately 17 months of use) and I am rating it 5 stars.  I am giving this set 5 stars for many reasons. I would be what you consider a DIY-home mechanic and I would not consider myself to be a professional. If you are going to use your tools every single day, then you may want to look somewhere else. With that said, I have never broken any of the tools in this set (yet) and I use the sockets and ratchets at least once a week.  I do brake service jobs (pads and rotors) on my family's vehicles, friends vehicles, and sometimes friends-of-friends vehicles. I have also used this set to remove partial dashboards to replace speedometer clusters, and other various components to a vehicle. I have changed transmission fluid, motor oil, rear differential fluid, brake fluid, and transfer assembly fluids using this set. I will add that for some jobs you may need a pair of pliers for vacuum hose clips, which this set does not include. I have also changed spark plugs, but the deepwell sockets in this set do not have a rubber boot in them to hold a spark plug. I used different ""spark plug"" sockets for this job. I will add that you may want to purchase longer extensions than what come with this set as to supplement this set of tools.  I really like the screwdriver bits that came with this set as I haven't stripped any of them (yet) with a fair amount of use using my 18v battery operated drill (not included in this set). The open-ended screwdriver that came with this set isn't the best quality, but that isn't going to affect my rating. It is usable, but I usually use the bits with an adapter on my battery operated drill.  I know many times when I read a review, I always want to ask the question: Would you buy it again?  My answer is pretty simple: If my garage burned to the ground and I lost all of its contents, one of the things that I would definitely purchase again is this set of tools.  The price is AMAZING for what all you get, and I haven't broken anything (yet). I don't like incriminating myself, but I may have used a ratchet and a 3 lb hammer a few times for stuck bolts. Everything in this set is made in China, but Stanley warranties everything. I haven't had to use it, but after reading other reviews (which I did before purchasing this tool set), no one has had problems getting replacements for broken tools. You call up the company with a part number and they mail it to you, done. Again, I haven't broken anything (yet), so I haven't had to call them up personally. Nothing in this set feels cheap to me, not even the case. It has 4 clips that lock tight around the case and it is easy to carry around with you, if you need to. For me, this case stays in the top cabinet of my tool box, and it is still my go-to set of tools when I need them.  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanley-STMT71654-201-Piece-Mechanics-Tool-Set/dp/B009EMKMCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanley STMT71654 201-Piece Mechanics Tool Set</a>",Excellent value for what you get. 5/5,1455494400,7.0,,"know adapter deepwell burn read stuck assembly use amount mechanic usable long rubber plug strip like purchase come cabinet say service stay rear dashboard fluid week add need come usually write september motor question extension hammer professional job time hold battery china least problem tight stanley get nothing affect family's many fluid spark wait open-ended ratchet reason definitely feel simple february different amaze warranty want lb speedometer clip purchase partial read box star friends somewhere mechanic thing really tool pair plier lock include one personally replace tool part change quality transmission make answer ratchet operate call rotor replacement mail go company good consider single vehicle lose set</a approximately use transfer bit price number want cheap month time purchase friends-of-friends component differential would bolt various fair give top sometimes pad everything buy content also supplement vehicle still even cluster go-to ground data-hook=""product-link-linked hose include easy else remove class=""a-link-normal day garage vacuum screwdriver rating case never plug brake broken review oil around best set yet sockets diy-home look drill ask use job bit always get incriminate boot do every may anything carry pretty review"

It's a good niche solution for anyone who can't wear (or can't stand to wear) a headlamp.  I'm one of those people.  Sometimes an elastic banded light is not the right solution for the task at hand.  For me, the elastic slips off my smooth hair too easily.  (Can you imagine all the disasters that could happen, in say, a dark portapotty?)  A hat is more likely to stay on my head---and a cap light makes sense for all the times you need both hands free.  This ThorFire light is pretty good---it's simple, lightweight, and more-or-less user-proof.  They went the extra step and made the housing out of that soft-touch plastic--same goes for the single power button, which is slightly domed so you can find it by touch alone.  The 5 LEDs are bright enough for small tasks, but not overly bright, which may be smart, in the sense that they won't drown everything in glare.  The LED head is positionable, although it's more like 80 degrees of motion, rather than the 90 degrees advertised, and the light clicks into several positions rather than traveling smoothly.  The only thing I wish was different is the clip.  It's just a friction clip, like we used to have on (ye old-timey) pagers, and I think the light would have been more versatile if they had made it a hinge clip or alligator clip.  That would have allowed all sorts of other applications, such as being able to clip it to your jacket, or the shoulder strap of a Camelbak or backpack.  I have a variety of power storage and lighting items from ThorFire that I've used on science expeditions and recreational camping trips---I don't think there's been a bad one in the bunch.

The seller welcomes good/bad/indifferent feedback so I agreed to test and review these. That is a must.  Here is what I found:  This is an obscenely good value on paper. 4 lithium ion 18650 cells that are protected from overcharging or overdischarging. A lot of people don't realize that draining a lithium battery too low is bad news as well as overcharging one. Samsung knows about this now and is doing a recall. These batteries have the functionality to protect the cells from doing either (trust me, whatever brand you buy, get this).  Something I really, really like is the 3000mA rating on the batteries. That is probably a best case scenario but I imagine they are pretty close to this (I need a test setup to dig further). One thing I dislike is when batteries put something crazy on them like ""6000mAh"" or ""10,000mAh"". No way one of these will hit that. Around 3,400 is about the most I've seen and they are costly.  Testing:  I've got about 6 flashlights that take these so I loaded 4 up, turned them on and told the kids to have a blast. I turned one on (I've got 3 kids) and let it sit there. These lasted almost as long as my LG 18650 that I have. To me, these are the future and last a lot longer and are brighter that using 3 AAA batteries in them.  All 4 batteries were charged and all worked well. The charger is alright, serviceable and works but it does feel a bit cheap. I'm not worried about using it as these 18650's are protected so I'm happy with it. If I could, I would knock off half a star to make it 4.5 but I really still think these are very much worth it.  Overall, I definitely recommend these. I love the price (I bought a 2 pack of some similar ones and charger at full price of these before) and these look better and the charger is nicer (but not pretty).

It also will dim lower (at least with my dimmers) than most cheaper LED BR30 bulbs I've tried. It's suitably bright and has a wide uniform beam pattern. Overall, it does a good job of seeming like an incadescent bulb and is a huge step up from a CFL or early LED bulb.  The bad: I knocked two stars off for the high price, poor support from Philips, and the questionable heat sink scheme to keep the electronics in the bulb cool enough for a long life.  Mine didn't come with any sort of warranty information. Nor can I find this bulb on the Philips website or any warranty information for any of their LED bulbs. In fact, a lot of the links Philips provides don't even work. For more information, compatible dimmers, support, etc, you're directed to a page that doesn't exist. Their website (at least at the time of this review) is a mess.  For an example of a company that does it right, check out CreeBulb. Right at the bottom of their home page is a WARRANTY link with the the details clearly spelled out for all their LED bulbs. Are you reading this Philips?  So, if this bulb fails before it's 25,000 hours are up (or even in the first two years (which is only 17K hours of 24/7 use), I have no idea what the options are for getting Philips to replace it. It may have only a 90 day or 1 year warranty and/or disclaimers for the rated life due to the fixtures used, application, customer usage, etc. It might as well be a no-name Chinese bulb if Philips doesn't offer any obvious way to get it replaced or has only a short warranty.  Most reflector lamps are operated in partially enclosed fixtures usually pointed down. There's no airflow through the enclosure to cool the bulb causing all the heat generated to accumulate in the enclosure and for the electronics that operate the bulb to be ""cooked"" in the hottest part of the fixture. Most LED bulbs fail from the internal power supply dying. So the heat sink design, and the quality of the parts used inside, are critical. That's why you see cooling fins on the outside of many reflector LED bulbs. But this bulb has no external cooling fins.  The hundred+ dollars this bulb is supposed to save you assumes it will last 25,000 hours compared to an incandescent bulb. But what you should really be comparing it to are other LED bulbs. Plus the LED chips may well last that long but the power supply in the bulb operating at very high temperatures probably won't. Capacitors in the power supply on't like high temps and many are often only rated for a few thousand hours at their maximum temperature. So keeping them cool is critical.  One would hope a large company like Philips would use higher quality components than all the no-name Chinese manufactures. But only time will tell. If these bulbs only last a few thousand hours, like many other LED bulbs used in enclosed fixtures, they're rather expensive (2X - 3X the price) compared to the ones sold in the big box stores with energy rebates. But if the warm dimming is important to you, and you don't mind the price and poor support from Philips, they might be worth it.","Nice bulb but expensive, might be short lived, unknown warranty support",1420416000,,,review compatible cause power read clearly heat capacitor option and/or i've bright find pattern work use dollar way customer like disclaimer wide reflector hundred sell mess dim fail exist hour spell supply fin come maximum chinese usually might fail on't expensive one job temperature last least incadescent enclosure get important high rebate airflow many poor enough due questionable compare link big color dim mine store knock long provide partially box huge star hope electronics no-name really keep that's warm obvious one bulb website fact point dimmer page replace offer part lot application enclose operate fixture quality tell right creebulb operate incandescent beam compare company good home direct use probably large worth outside cheap energy first bulb design step pleasantly price fixture assume high led cool early generate time sort component mind uniform information would part check bad etc lamp also usage link cfl suppose operate even see temperature sink inside bottom day year chip accumulate idea cooling cook external plus short becomes overall two often critical try seem life rat hot thousand manufacture scheme warranty there's philip detail well year example get save they're internal may suitably low keep die temp rather support replace

They won't replace my beloved Streamlight Microstream, but I will have them all over the place just in case.  I was surprised at the amount of machining done to these. They have a ton of steps in diameter, fins with longitudinal scallops, and holes drilled parallel to the body on one flange. Now all these cuts do make the light look a bit like a transformer. There is something to be said for a sleek streamlined body. But for the price I cant complain. I may try to trim one down to the bare minimum.  The light itself is quite bright. With the lens pulled all the way back, it throws a large flood beam. Its good for not blinding yourself when working on something up close. When the beam is there tightened up it can easily shine to the tops of the 50ft trees that are about 20 yards from my house. Its a little odd to see the individual COBs when zoomed in, but its bright.  The modes are easy to cycle through. I simply cycle to the strobe before I turn it off to ensure I get the bright setting when turned back on. If the chip has a time out for mode memory I haven't noticed it.  As far as true brightness, I don't think it is pumping out 300 lumens using a 1.5 volt AA. I have some 14500s ordered to see how much the 3.7 volts burps up the power.

Fortuitously, Uverse installed a new modem a few days ago, so I had to set up my Belkin Wemo switches again, so it was was easy to compare the two.  Usage - Draw. Both products work as advertised - they connect to your Wifi so that you can control your devices remotely. I have mine set up on a schedule (lights turn on in the evening so that my apartment is lit when I come home). Very handy.  Setup - Ankuoo wins this round for sure. WeMo repeatedly had trouble connecting to my wifi, even though my password was entered correctly over and over and over.  I had to restart the app and *finally* Wemo would connect. I had no such problems with Ankuoo. It comes with a very easy guide, and a quick download of the app had me up and running with the setup.  No issues at all, and I had the Smart Switch up and running in about 5 minutes (probably less).  App - Ankuoo wins again. A more streamlined app, and I think a more user-friendly app all around.  I also love the ""anti-theft timer"" feature. Easy to set a schedule for your lights.  Appearance - Belkin wins this round. I like the all white look instead of the blue, which is somewhat garish and not that great to look at. Not a deal breaker, though.  [UPDATE: Well, it looks like Ankuoo also offers an all-white option now, so this is now a draw!]  Price - Ankuoo wins this round. It comes in at about 8 dollars cheaper.  [UPDATE: The prices on the two switches have changed a bit, but the Ankuoo is still cheaper at this point in time.]  Product support - Draw. Have never had to contact Ankuoo, but I will say that Belkin is very helpful in their responses.  Overall - Ankuoo wins overall. The only thing I like more about the WeMo is the appearance, and that's not a big deal. However, both products are really great and I would recommend both to anyone that is interested in a wifi switch.  I'll update the review if anything changes!

The measure seems to work by registering the the last mark actually passed even though the tape may actually be closest to the next mark. If you don't double check your measurement could be short by as much as 1/16th of an inch which of course is unacceptable for furniture, boxes, or other precision crafting.

This prevents large debris from clogging or stopping up the pump.  It needs to be rinsed off occasionally, dependent on the amount of debris in the pond.  That can be weekly or monthly.  To make the prefilter, start with an open top dark plastic container with holes in the side (such as a laundry basket or crate).  It must be large enough to hold the pump with room to spare.  Enlarge a hole in the side, if necessary, for the discharge hose to fit through to the pump.  Line the container with the AC foam filter, place the pump inside, connect the hose and place more filter on top that overlaps that on the sides (more overlap is better to hold it in place).  Rocks or stones can be placed on top the container to help conceal the pump and to hold the top filter in place.  This size AC Form Filter is good for smaller pond pumps.  For larger pond pumps extra filtration material may be needed.  I use 3 lingerie laundry bags filled with 15-20 nylon scrubbies (6 for $1 at the Dollar Store).  I've had very few water clarity or pump problems after using these prefilters for around 5 years.

Because of the ridged hose design I often had difficulty getting the nozzle head out and properly seated back in.  I would recommend a tiltable nozzle holder or maybe vinyl covered to make removal smoother?  I would have also liked the ability to attach to the side of my sink vanity or the wall.  That would eliminate both holster and hose length issues for me.  My bathroom is very small so the long hose was hanging down and getting caught on the wastebasket.  Maybe a selection of hose lengths?  NEUTRAL OBSERVATION:  It did take me some time to learn how to best hold the nozzle and not get water outside of toilet or on my clothing.

I installed two of these lights on each side of the back of my house under the eaves.  After two months of constantly up and down the ladder trying to get these to work, I've finally removed them and replaced them with a different unit.  After two months of adjusting the position of the lamps, the sensitivity, and the duration of the light being on, I think I'm pretty confident in saying that mounting these lights under your eaves (as opposed to mounting vertically on a wall) probably won't work. I think 99% of the problem is that they have the sensor too close to the bulbs.  The problem you will face in installing this unit is that if you turn down the sensitivity of the unit, you'll have a difficult time getting the lights to turn on without being about 5 feet away from where they are mounted which is no good (at least for me).  The other problem is that if you increase the sensitivity so they will turn on in the manner you want, the heat from the bulbs will cause the sensor to re-trigger the lights because the sensor is too close to the bulbs.  This problem is worse if you set the timer for 5 minutes or more.  You'll also get fooled while you're setting them up because you'll have the unit in test mode, which I think the lights will trigger for only 5 seconds, which not enough heat will build up so the light will work correctly.  So after you set the unit to keep the lights on for more time, you'll end up with lights that will never go off.  I would set my lights up, and something would trigger them, and I would want to give them a chance to turn off by themselves, but I would end up turning them off manually after an hour or two - frustrated.  So the bottom line here is that if you're going to mount the lights vertically on a wall, you may have some luck.  However, if you're going to mount them under your eaves, you'll need a unit where the sensor can be positioned farther away from the bulbs and preferably lower than the bulbs because the heat from the bulbs will rise and not be a factor in re-triggering the bulbs.

This latest iteration comes with Torx screw at the pivot to allow for adjustment while rest of the knife is still put together with rivets.  It is a lighter version of original Manix2 with full metal liners, which was rather heavy for its size.  Personally, I like this version much, much better, weighing 40% lighter than the original Manix2, without losing any of its utility.  Despite its light weight, it is built rock solid and feels great in my hands.  The caged ball bearing lock is similar in concept to Benchmade's Axis lock but feels much more taut and require more force to engage/disengage due to use of much stronger spring.  It's a matter of personal preference, like anything else.  Benchmade Axis lock generally feel smoother, yet solid.  Spyderco's ball bearing lock feels more deliberate, requiring more force to operate.  Strong detente prevents any accidental blade opening in the pocket.  I like both designs.  While the knife is light and deep carry pocket clip allows for discreet carry, it is pretty wide, which may turn some people off.  I also like the Carpenter DB1 steel; while it seems to lose extreme sharpness sooner than higher end premium steels,  it keeps the working edge for a long time and is relatively easy to resharpen.  The price will not break the bank and its light weight, solid build quality and supreme utility of its design makes it one of my favorite knives to carry on daily basis.

It's solidly constructed almost everywhere, as far as I can tell, although a few months of tossing it into the back of a truck along with a bunch of other tools will tell the eventual tale.  If it fails later I'll try to remember that I promised to update this review.  Understand, now, that I'm not promising to update the review, I'm merely saying I will try to remember to.  The spring that presses the release trigger back to its original position when you let go of it, at least on my exact clamp, doesn't work as zealously as you would like in the sense that the trigger doesn't get sprung all the way forward.  For this defect in design or craftsmanship I subtract 1 star.  The release trigger itself works just fine, i.e., when you press it the steel tabs (or maybe it's just one) that grip the bar are released and the head slides easily, and when you let go the head clamps down securely.  The maximum clamping distance is 11 7/8 inches, not the 12 inches advertised, although I don't think that's a big deal.  ***  If you remove the stationary tailpiece, which is done by pressing up on a spring-loaded piece of plastic, you can place it on the other end of the bar and use the device as a spreader.  The maximum spread is 20 3/8 inches, which is enough to spread two adjacent studs 16 inches on center but not two that are 24 inches on center.  You can even attach the tailpiece upside down, which is a configuration that might come in handy and which is also a configuration not mentioned by the manufacturer.  Speaking of which, the name of the product needs two corrections.  First, it should be 12-inch, not 12 inch.  Second, it should be called Yost Bar Clamp and Spreader, not just Yost Bar Clamp.  The fact it's also a spreader differentiates it from many other bar clamps, which is a characteristic that should have been exploited.  The two pads, which are soft enough not to damage wood but stiff enough not to compress, meet first at the top rather than all along their height, which is unexpected and undesirable, for which I subtract another star.  This is either poor design or poor manufacture.  Oh, and here's something the instructions don't tell you, mainly because there are no instructions: When you go to re-locate the tailpiece you have to make sure that it fits over the two retaining studs at either end of the bar.  If you position it all the way past the studs then it will just slide around when you move it or carry it, which is mildly irritating at best and downright dangerous at worst, so don't make that mistake (or don't buy this clamp to begin with).  Unfortunately, getting the tailpiece to sit just right over those two studs is fiddly; about half the time I position it either too far, in which case it slides around as noted, if I'm not mistaken, in the last sentence, or I don't position it far enough, in which case it falls off when I let go of the plastic pushy-uppy thing and it lands on one of my steel-toed construction boots or the other.  Succumbing to fiddliness on a construction site is unacceptable, partly because time is money and partly because your fellow carpenters will laugh at you.  For this enforced fiddliness I subtract half of a star.  For the fact the designers of the label on both sides of the device left plenty of room to etch or mark in one's name or telephone number I add back a quarter of a star.  ***  Many things cannot be successfully clamped together using this Yost 15012 12 Inch 330 lbs.
