Alternatively, the probe shields leave only 2mm of tip exposed, reducing the possibility of a short circuit.  When I snipped a piece of paper clip to insert into a connector, I found that a smaller, lighter clip would have attached to the wire better.  It takes eight full turns to screw a clip on, so it seems more efficient to carry them draped over my neck like a scarf, and swap leads when necessary. There's little movement as the leads rest against the front of my shirt, but, however tightly I screw the clips on, they won't stay on. They may fall off within three steps.  I probably won't realize it at the time. so I'll end up searching.

Lots of special purpose tapes that sit around unused, until the right situation occurs and then they are just the right thing to utilize.  Several of the types were unknown to me, yet now that I have them, I have immediate uses for them (see the full list in the product description above).  One thing that is good is that they include a card with usage suggestions.  For example, I didn't know what I might want the Foam Removable Tape for, and after seeing the suggestions I realized that I could use them as a quick and easy way to put artwork on the wall, as well as securing a kitchen rug that slips.  Search amazon for ""tapecase tape kit"" if you would like a different assortment, as there are numerous different sets available (or go to the tapecase website).  CONS:  The provided storage/organizing box looks nice at first, but I quickly realized that it is much larger than needed.  All the tapes themselves, if not spaced out nicely as they are in the box, would fit in a much smaller 5x5x2 inch box -- better for those with limited storage.  The actual box is 14.5x8.5x2.5 inches, and you can see from the photo above of the opened box how much empty space there is.  It would have been nice if they had included the possibility of adding more components, for example, I have some of their silicone tape, and I'd like to put it with the other tapes in the box, but it doesn't fit.  Also, and I know this is quibbling, I'd like a few more samples of some of the special purpose tapes.

When I read that Delta had a new clamping method for the lower clear plastic bag I was excited. If you have ever wrestled with the typical clamping system for the lower bag you know exactly what I am referring to. Trying to keep a slippery, stiff, slightly oversized plastic bag while you secure a metal strap belt around it with no loops of course is a pain. Not that emptying bags of dust isn't already the most dreaded task in the shop, it is further exacerbated by the finicky clamping system.  Delta did come up with a new system for securing the lower bag, the only problem is that it is just as difficult to mount as the clamp. It is simply a metal ring sewn inside of a cloth cover. You are supposed to wrap about 5 or 6 inches of the clear plastic slippery stiff bag around it and then snap it into place. Good luck. I spent 20 minutes playing with it. I could snap it in fine without the bag, and it would hold with good resistance, but once you introduced the slippery, stiff bag there was very little hold resistance. I finally used the included clamp which is just like my JDS. Oh well back to the drawing board. The whole challenge with the clamping system is simply holding the bag into place, which is ever so slightly oversized and once again slippery while you install the metal belt with clamp. You become a contortionist real quick. Delta did weld little tiny metal pieces on the sides by they don't help either. I am thinking of designing some sort of clamping system which would make the whole thing a breeze. Simply hold the bag while I install the belt clamp. Oh well back to the drawing board.  What about sound levels? I only have the JDS to compare it to. The JDS is quieter by a good bit. The Delta is not put on the ear protection loud, but since I have a basement shop the sound level is important to me. The Delta has some lower frequencies that are only moderate when running, and become more apparent when starting up and slowing down. There is a lot of ways to look at this. If you tend to like some bass in your music you may like the way this sounds. It has a serious industrial feeling to it; very impressive. On the other hand if you cherish whisper quiet this is not it.  The size of the unit. I have a low ceiling in my shop of only 88 inches. Typical ceilings are 8 foot or 96 inches or higher so the fact that this Delta fully setup has an upper bag rod that hits 92 inches would not normally be a problem. That is unless you had 8 foot ceilings with 4 inch down fluorescent lights; then it would bang into them. As it is now I will be using this with the rod lowered some. I have to figure out a way of clamping it into the lowered position because it is designed to be fully extended. It has a little ball bearing that pops out into the hole in the tube. Also when the holding rod which is an L shaped bracket does not extend all the way to the top making the fabric loop on the top bag get secured real well you run the risk of it coming loose. In plain words this is the tallest dust collector I found, although there may be another one out there.  Here are some dimensions if that helps you. I eyeballed the dimensions with a tape measure so I say roughly with the measurements. Upper bag collecting fine dust Delta roughly 19"" across x 45"" high equals 855 cubic inches JDS roughly 21"" across x 28"" high equals 588 cubic inches Lower bag collecting the big stuff Delta 19"" across x 30"" high equals 570 cubic inches JDS 21"" across x 31"" high equals 651 cubic inches  So the Delta has a lesser volume lower bag which is the one that collects the big particles and needs dumping but has a much larger upper bag for the fine powdery stuff. A valid argument could be made that with the increased surface area of the upper bag you would get additional breathing before it would get a thick enough coating that would result in diminished air flow. So the Delta would be superior in that regard. However I do not have any such air flow problems in the JDS. The JDS bag upper is wider by 2"" but substantially lower thereby the ceiling clearance is huge. Most of the other dust collectors I have seen online are built that way. So with the Delta you are getting more surface on the upper bag at the expense of needing a higher ceiling to accommodate it.  Let me talk about my shop and how it is setup and maybe you can glean something from it. Yes I was given this unit in order to write a review, so it is my responsibility to work hard to provide you as much relevant information as I can. So I have this Delta and the JDS that I bought earlier. The JDS is hooked up solely to my 15"" Shop Fox planer. I also have between the planer and the JDS Dust Force a 32 gallon metal trash can with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woodstock-W1049-Large-Dust-Collection-Separator/dp/B0000223XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woodstock W1049 Large Dust Collection Separator</a>&nbsp;That is a huge advantage. The main reason is that it collects the big stuff before it is sent along to the JDS. It is easy to lift the separator off of the can, and dump the can into a second plastic trash can with a trash bag installed, then it is to disassemble the dust collector each time, not to mention that this gives you twice the capacity of shavings build up before you have to dump. It also helps prevent any by chance metal particles from hitting the fan blade causing a spark. Highly recommended piece of equipment. See the Amazon page and they have my review featured with the most amount of helpful votes. My review is called, ""Must have piece of equipment."" It is so cheap you can't afford not to have it.  So I have the JDS just going to the planer which creates the most amount of waste/dust. The Delta now which also has twin 4"" dust ports solely takes care of my 8"" Powermatic jointer, and model 66 table saw. They are both hooked up without any gates, and this Delta pulls plenty of air to service both of them at the same time. I have 5 and 6 hp shop vac, quiet ones hooked up to my router tables with a side switch containing two outlets, one for the router, and one for the shop vac so when I want to use the router I have one switch to hit and bingo I'm routing. Routers do not generate the huge amount of waste like a planer does. I find that when using the standard 2 1/2"" dust collection hose you need a shop vac in order to properly service it. These huge dust collection systems like the JDS and the Delta have large fans that are purposely not as close in the tolerances as a shop vac. If you close off the available air on the big systems they don't squeal like a shop vac. I think they purposely left some air gap between the housing and the blades so the motor would not burn out in the event of an air blockage. Anyhow trying to take a huge 6 or 8 inch breathing tube divided into two 4 inch tubes and then narrowing that down to 2 1/2"" does not result in a lot of suction. In plain words with all of that reduction and using a big dust collector the amount of suction that is being drawn out at the opening is far less than the relentless suction of a shop vac. So the shop vac does a much better job of collecting router dust with a 2 1/2"" pipe. If you have a 4"" pipe on your router table then you are good with the Delta doing the job.  So by having two of these you are capturing the main tools that generate a ton of material. Large drum sanders generate a lot also, so a Y connector on the JDS instead of solely using it for the planer would solve that problem. Having a whole shop dust collection piping system running 6"" pipe or better requires gates, and the task of going around opening, and closing the others. It also can get a bit expensive to properly setup. You could buy a second dust collector for that kind of money. You also may need a larger dust collector with more horsepower and CFM in order to service a longer pipe run and larger system. So I like the simplicity of the twin dust collector system better.  Let's talk about the number one most important dust collection system, and that is your lungs. I have two air filtration ceiling mounts just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JET-708620B-AFS-1000B-550-702-1044-CFM-3-Speed-Air-Filtration-System-with-Remote-and-Electrostatic-Pre-Filter/dp/B00004R9LO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JET 708620B AFS-1000B 550/702/1044 CFM 3-Speed Air Filtration System with Remote and Electrostatic Pre-Filter</a>&nbsp;that filter the airborne particles. All of this stuff is based on capturing 85 or 90% of particles that are 1 or 2 microns in size, and some of them even go down to .5 microns (point five). The only problem is that the stuff that is smaller than point five microns is the stuff that your lungs has a problem getting rid of, and the government has released that airborne shop dust is a carcinogen. So the reason why I am telling you this is that it is necessary to protect your lungs. It doesn't have to be a major inconvenience to do so. Those paper masks are a waste of time. A handy solution is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3M-Paint-Project-Respirator-Large/dp/B0009F5KDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3M Paint Project Respirator, Large</a>&nbsp;They come in small, medium, and large. They are only 20 some dollars and a set of cartridges lasts a long, long time. It is easy to have it secured with the lower strap and allow it to drape in front of you for doing things other than heavy dust creating tasks, and then if you need to do something dusty you just raise it up over your head. This is a superb fit on your face, captures everything with no leaks around the sides. As soon as the air clears, you drop it down again. You can wear some clear plastic goggles while using this in order to protect your eyes, but the ones that are fully enclosed wind up fogging up and become a pain. The ultimate solution is a full face model like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3M-7162-Full-Facepiece-Spray-Paint-Respirator-Organic-Vapor/dp/B0002STR86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3M 7162 Full-Facepiece Spray Paint Respirator - Organic Vapor</a>. That is worth the investment because it protects your whole face, and has an inside face mask that is like the paint project respirator so your exhausted air doesn't get into the face eye viewing area, so your vision is always clear. It also has the option to get the extended fresh air supplied respirator attachment with a fresh air pump and then you are only breathing clean clear fresh air all of the time. This is especially useful if you are doing a repetitive task or only moving between a couple of machines because the fresh air is supplied by a hose. Fresh air pumps are not cheap.  You may look at it like the dust in the air is not a problem. I have a test for you. Walk into your shop, and if you have them turn on the ceiling mount air filtration that captures down to .5 microns. You walked into a fresh air smelling shop, now turn them on and take a whiff. What do you smell? Wood dust. So what these units are doing is spewing the most dangerous .5 and lower micron dust into the air so you are breathing it. An exhaust fan in the window, with even the 3M inexpensive smaller mask is ideal and why I like to work during the summer with the windows open.  Anyhow what does this have to do with the Delta 50-767? Namely this. It collects the big dust but further protection is important to know about to collect the ultra-fine stuff. Happy woodworking. I come that ye may have dust, and collect it more healthfully. :-)  UPDATE: After all of these years of woodworking I discovered something with this Delta collector that I wish I realized a long time ago. Why not just get a contractor grade of bag that is 3 mills and clear, and attach it to the bottom portion of the collector. When you see it getting full you go over and simply take it off, tie the top by creating two rabbit ears with some of the material and tie them together. Now it is ready to be carried off to the trash. NO MORE MESSY POUR JOBS out of the bottom bag into another one. So far I have found the clear bags here at Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/42-Gallon-Contractor-Bags-50-Case-Clear/dp/B001C0SIUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">42 Gallon Contractor Bags - 50 / Case - Clear</a>&nbsp;which fit perfectly, and hold up when you turn the machine on. I have used them and carried the bag out when full and they don't break. It works well, but I will not dispense of the woodstock collection lid with trash can. The only reason being that I don't like it when chunks of wood, or even worse a piece of metal when vacuuming the floor hits the metal fan blade. The Woodstock acts like a pre-separator screening out the hard stuff. I am thinking use the big shop vac system just for drawing dust directly from the machines, and then using the portable shop vacs with an inner bag for doing the floor stuff with the possible metal screws etc.","Superb quality build precision fit, superb welds.

They were not too tight, and look about 1mm (0.040"") diameter clearance to the winding holes.  (I don't have calipers at home to measure that close). The winding process took about 4-5 minutes per side. I had locked a vice grip on the shaft to keep it from turning round and round unexpectedly.  When I tightened the winding cone screws, the wrench started turning a bit downward as if the springs were trying to the lift the door.  Seemed about right.

Changed from 5 stars to one star: my printer power supply failed 10 days after the printer was ordered.  I was able to find a replacement online, because my printer was out of 30 day support window - had to wait for a week to get it, and submitted my request for the first time after two weeks of owning the printer.  Printrbot support is very bad - takes 5-10 days to hear back and my request for a power supply was denied.  I bought a second kit and power supply for that printer failed during the first print.  Printrbot.com support states that you need to return the entire kit to get a replacement power supply.

It has six  brushing modes, three different brushes and a smart guide to that helps me keep brushing a full two minutes.  The toothbrush and smart guide are easy to assemble. The guide book has easy to read text and good diagrams that make it easy to assemble, use and clean the toothbrush and smart guide.  The toothbrush comes with six cleaning modes. The modes are  daily clean with 3D movement, sensitive mode, whitening mode, massage mode, deep clean mode and tongue cleaner mode. I have used them all and switch depending on how I am feeling or upon the recommendation of my dentist.  Overall, all the modes feel comfortable to use.  The massage mode causes my gums to tingle a bit. The deep clean mode(which is a minute longer than the other modes) is great if I have been eating something sugary and I want a longer clean.  The sensitive mode is great if I have had dental work and part of my mouth is sore.  I especially like the smart guide. It is great for children as well as lazy adults such as myself.  The smart guide is a battery operated clock that has a smiley face on it with a circle around it and stars on the bottom of the screen.  The moment the toothbrush is turned on an icon on the smart guide shows which cleaning mode is currently being used. As you change modes by pressing a button on the toothbrush the smart guide shows an icon representing the mode.  Once you turn on the toothbrush the clock on the smart guide disappears and a timer starts listing the time you use the toothbrush. The instruction book explains that you should brush one quadrant of your mouth at a time. After 30 seconds are up (45 in the deep cleaning mode) a quarter of the circle around the smiling face is filled in letting the user know it is time to  move to the next quadrant. The toothbrush also beeps and stops for a second. One of the stars on the smartguide is then filled in. The guide also lets you know of you are using too much pressure.  I don't like to brush my teeth and two minutes can seem like an eternity when I am rushing to get to work or when I am tired at the end of the night.  The smart guide helps me  brush for the recommended amount of time.  Other things that I like about this include the fact that battery life lasts for up to 10 days.

This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). ""No pain, no gain,"" does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum ""massager,"" mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and ""massaging,"" the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can't really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well.

I think it is a phenomenal value right now compared to other products on the market.  I had to cut about 10 minutes out of the video just to get it down to size, so parts may seem a bit choppy, but hopefully it gets the information across.  A good chunk of it (the second part of the video) is showing off the free FLIR Tools software that you can use with photos from the ONE - and that software is something that helps FLIR blow away the similarly priced Seek Thermal imager.  The video covers almost everything that I wanted to point out, but I had to remove some things to get it down to size, so below are some highlights and additional details.  * CHECK COMPATIBILITY BEFORE YOU BUY * - I highly recommend that you go to the app store for your phone/tablet (iOS or Android) and check if you can download the software.  Some of my phones will, but some won't.  It doesn't seem related to Android version, either, but rather the phones themselves.  I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seek-Compact-Thermal-Imager-for-Android/dp/B00NYWAHHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seek Compact Thermal Imager for Android</a>&nbsp;in January 2015 for about $230, and I got FLIR's C2 camera last year (currently costs about $700), and I'm going to make comparisons to both of those.  For $250 for the ONE right now, it is by far the best value out there, IMO.  In a nutshell, this device lets you view the temperature of objects using your phone or tablet.  Many thermal imagers on the market cost far more than the ONE.  Most have additional resolution and capability, but a lot of us don't need that for how we'd use one of these devices.  For checking your home for insulation leaks, or looking for hot spots in a stack of electronic gear, imagers like this are just great.  Here's why I think this is the best value out there: (*) Thermal and Visual cameras included and used with MSX to give you an easy to interpret thermal image.  Seek Thermal lets you do side-by-side images using their thermal camera and your devices visual camera, but it's just not the same.  When looking at a bunch of objects that are nearly the same temperature, it can really help to have the visual image overlaid on top to show the outlines of things (*) Works with FLIR Tools free software.  This is HUGE.  Those tools let you post-process your images in several ways (my video only shows a few things), and they are available on Mac and PC.  The PC version lets you add spots and other measuring tools that don't work with the ONE images on the Mac.  Other than that, both versions are very capable (*) Can do images and videos, but the C2 camera can only do images.  However, videos may be choppy depending on your phone (*) Offers similar capabilities (some better, some not quite as good) as FLIR's C2 camera...and the C2 is $700, versus $250 for the ONE.  As long as you have a phone or tablet that works with this, or are willing to buy one, this is a tremendous value.  I have a tablet that costs <$100 that works with the ONE (*) When attached to your phone/tablet, you can send the images over e-mail or whatever just like you'd send any file to people.  For example, you could take thermal images on the job site, send them to the main office right away, and have your team send some post-processed images on to a client minutes later.  The C2 camera would require you to download images off of it first before you could send them using some other device, whereas this is super convenient  Here's what I wish they'd done differently: (*) The ONE should have been made to run off your phone's battery if the internal battery runs out - then it actually would have been a design advantage over the Seek Thermal.  As it is, you have to remember to charge it.  If the ONE's battery is dead, well, you're out of luck (*) Swappable connectors.  I really think that they should have allowed users to swap out lightning and micro USB connectors on a common camera body.  Some of us have both types of phones, or have family members with the other type.  Even with a constant connector, they should have gone with a reversible micro USB design.  Those have been out for months now, and it would have allowed us to use these in either direction on our devices  Again, I could talk all day about this, so if you have any questions about the ONE, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.

I wasn't expecting much from the printer so my expectations weren't high.  I watched as many YouTube videos on setting up the printer as I could.  As soon as I got the printer I flashed the screen and rom as well as changed its settings according to the videos.  I didn't use the filament that came with the printer as there was very little of it.  I bought some Inland PLA filament here on Amazon and loaded that instead.  I started printing the included model of the cat and it came out great.  I started downloading .stl files from Thingiverse and printing them without issue (Using Cura to slice).  All was well and then my prints went to garbage.  I watched more 3d print videos and apparently my bed was out of level.  This is where the fun begins, NOT!  I thought I would have to send the machine back because it seemed no matter what technique I used to level the bed my prints were still garbage.  Finally I watched a video that suggested using a business card for each of the four corners (I had been using a piece of paper)... that did the trick.  After practice, I can level the bed in no time flat.  Again watch videos on leveling.  I also had to clear a filament jam which was interesting.. again, another video to watch.  I started playing with various bed temps as well as filament temps.  I bought other types of filament to see what worked the best.  Let me give you a heads up, if you are going to use ABS... Don't.  It's a headache.. doable but still a headache with all the things you need to do to get it to stick properly.  I did some ABS prints and they came out great but again.. a headache.  I also found that about middle of the road for temperature depending on what the filament calls for is what worked for me.  For PLA 60c (Edit: 40c is fine after the first layer) was perfect and for ABS I sliced whatever I was printing with the bed set to 60.  Once the print would start I would up the bed temp to 80c.  The bed would only get to around 78c.  For ABS to work I had also used an Elmer's glue stick on my blue 3m masking tape covered bed to get it to stick.  Again, stick with PLA.  Oh I failed to mention, when the initial masking tape comes off the bed plate which it will, you can cover it back up with 3M blue masking tape, the same kind you use when you paint.  Since I have played, I can pretty much tell by what I am printing what setting I should use.  I can only suggest that you play around and watch a lot of videos.  At this price and for a single spool of filament you should be having fun and learning.  I have since moved on from using Cura and am now using Simplify3d which is rather pricey but I really like it.  The small build plate is a challenge as a lot of models that you may want to print will be much bigger.  Scaling has its issues.  Trying to take off supports when the part of the model it is connected to can be tricky.  I included a picture of my latest print (Not sure why it shows up on Amazon sideways).

I purchased this product to supplant my stainless steel cup brushes. I really like how well the stainless steel cup brushes work, but they are do have definite risks to work with. You're behind a power tool, pushing one of those into your work piece. Little bits of wire break off (!), they can puncture your fingers while you're handling or grasping them and generally become very fragile all of a sudden towards the end of their usable life. So I purchased this having read the details about the product and how it works (flexible bristles impregnated with abrasives).  First and foremost, because the bristles aren't as firm this product won't strip off rust from a stud frame wall nearly as fast as a stainless steel version. That aside, this thing is freakin awesome. The flexible bristles mean that I can fit these much more comfortably into corners of a work piece. It doesn't kick back so suddenly like a stainless steel brush would if you hit something like a lip or edge. Very much unlike the old stainless steel cup brush, this thing is quite uniform in the work it does. It's almost surreal how different two sections of stud wall turned out using the old product and the new.  When the bristles break off, they don't have the same kind of energy or tension so it's lower velocity. Much less of a need for safety glasses. This is not for use on softer materials like wood, as it will gum up the bristles.

I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.  To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.  The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.  FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.",'InAcuRite' hygrometer (humidity) display is WRONG BY A LONG SHOT (although temperature is in the ballpark),1459036800,8.0,,lukewarm second cheapest house rain judge awkward read subject much praise work act pathetic consider error way like grammatical result unintentionally model hour decor stay reviewer simply need describe usually write location vintage room article's function job next title unit several replacement google due i'd within gauge temp/humidity station enough change claim spell problem chamber something make test accurite furnace bogus device reading want unit interested although detract read find fairly read put hygrometer percentage that's suitable website wall-mounted title article junk make degree request hardest-sold exact unobtrusive free home good list first amazon station accurate digital trust hygrometer result display purchase ranges host actual top nwclimate.org sometimes issue also fyi close fluctuate even temperature receive accuracy usa-made sent humidity numerous basement show widely differ around best two import come weather daughter's unless comparison return sudden web well always they're note mechanical acurite recommendation relative accuracy...maybe small pretty review

After reading all of the 1k+ reviews for this (it's the same as the model 6565A that is just another color) and going through all the answered questions, I'm pretty happy that I made this choice. Another reviewer called this ""a beast"" because of how well it cleans and they are so right! PROS: 1 - This is not a quiet machine but it is not as loud as I expected from a couple of other reviews. My cheap little Dirt Devil is just as loud and doesn't pick up anything but surface debris. The suction is amazing. You only have to choose the correct floor height setting. My carpet was dingy from spot cleaning, then using a low power vacuum. After a year's worth of hidden dirt, this vac really dug down and grabbed all kinds of dander-like debris. I'm sure this will be good for my breathing. You can see in the photo what I picked up with the Bissell after already having gone over the carpet 3 times with the Dirt Devil. Basically, my carpets have never been vacuumed! 2- It's not as heavy as some reviewers mention. Even on the lowest floor height setting, I had no problems using this (and I have back problems and low strength). 3- The cord is long enough that I don't' have to unplug when moving around my small apartment. 4 - There was no ""spit-back"" of debris like with some vacs. 5 - That dust canister is awesome! So easy to take off, dump, then reattach. That was a relief because emptying the dirt is my least favorite part of vacuuming. 6 - This wasn't too hard to put together. (You can see the attached photo for what it looked like out of the box and unassembled.) I timed myself and finished in just under 20 minutes. The only problem I had was that my eyes are not great and I took a lot of time re-reading the steps in the instructions. HINT: turn your vacuum around so that it matches the diagram in the instructions! 7- This maneuvers well enough for an upright. I did have to be careful to use both hands to stretch the hose when using attachments so I didn't yank the vacuum over. 8 - This fits in my entryway closet very easily (SEE PIC). When you live in a small apartment, storage is at a premium. I like that this stores where I can just roll it out to use it and put it back out of the way.  CONS: 1- The power button is in an odd spot. Like I said, I have back problems and I had to bend to reach the button. I understand why it's placed there though because of how the hose and the release take up the spaces at the bottom. 2- The hose could be a tad bit longer. It's long enough when the vac is not running, but the suction compresses it and I needed to use both hands to pull it to full length.  I really love this on Day 1. As someone else reviewed that if this lasts a year, I will be more than happy.  One tip I want to pass along is that the Bare Floor setting is also okay for very low carpets. It says that in the manual, but I somehow missed it. I picked up a lot more dirt when I lowered the head.  I included some Before and After photos of the carpet so you could get an idea of how well the vac cleaned it. I took one of them last night and one today so they might not line up properly, but there is a HUGE difference.  By the way, I went for the Teal color but, to tell the truth, I don't really pay that much attention to it now that I have it. This is the best vacuum I have ever used and my brother has one of the famous high-end ones that I can't even afford to borrow lest I break it!

My Gator board shipped with a small roll of it.  I'd never used it before but I was incredibly impressed by the strength of the lock.  Seriously, this is impressive stuff.  It makes Velcro industrial strength look like total garbage.  Yes, this stuff is very expensive but it works and is absolutely worth the premium.  No more hooks and loops anymore, this product mates with itself and doesn't have the destructive ""tear"" when separating. The pieces interlock and grip like nobody's business.  Package says good for 1000 separations (that's a lot) and I believe it.  A couple of tips: 1.  Although the backing adhesive is excellent, make sure you clean the mounting surfaces well with alcohol to remove any trace of grease.  Remember this stuff is strong, so you need a good adhesive bond that will withstand the force of separation. 2.  Try not to upset the roll when it arrives.  Don't unravel it.  I pull it out from the center.  The reason is if the film that protects the mounting adhesive gets separated you may be compromising the sticking properties. That would make it wear out faster. 3.  Plan carefully exactly how much you need.  This stuff is expensive but works so well you may need less than you think!  You can also cut it lengthwise for thinner strips.  This has worked well for me. 4.  Note: the adhesive is white which will stand out if placing on glass like a windshield.  5 stars.  Another fabulous 3M invention!",Forget Velcro!

I was NOT given the product to review and I have received nothing for this review.  Oh, and by the way, I have been using these probes professionally for years.  I just recently ordered a new set for a new meter I got.  Every good multimeter I have has a set of these probes to go with it.  These probes are an absolute MUST HAVE when working with modern SMT electronics.  Be aware that these precision probes are a bit delicate, so don't throw your standard multimeter probes away as you will still want those for some applications.  Youll also want those old clunky probes for when you loan your meter out.  The good news is that the tips for these probes are replaceable.  The tips are standard pogo pins used in bed-of-nails test fixtures, so there is a wide world of specialized pins that will work in these genius probes.  Pomona also sells a nice kit of replacement tips.  If you're careful with them, the tips will last forever, but its good that they are replaceable if necessary.  Some of the pins available for these probes are needle-sharp, so be careful.  In honestly advise buying two or three sets.  Once you have a set on one meter, youll want them on all of your meters.  And, once anyone else sees these probes, theyll want a set too.  Because these probes are a bit delicate and also sharp, I highly recommend also getting a POMONA 5955 CARRYING POUCH to keep them in; its a very nice pouch and perfect for keeping these probes in.  Because these probes are for use with microelectronics, they are expected to be used in tight places.  So, they lack the large finger guards found just above the tip on most millimeter probes.  While these probes have a nice gripping rubber surface, your fingers might slip down the probe and, without that guard, slide onto energized circuitry.  As a result, these probes are suitable only for testing safe, extra-low-voltage circuitry.  Just two more little notes:  first, these probes are color-coded red and black on the ends, but the rest of the probes and cables are gray; this could be an issue in some situations where rules and regulations require that probes be fully-color-coded.  And, second, these probes do have right-angle, safety-sheathed plugs. The safety-sheath can be cut off if your instrument doesnt accommodate it, but the right angle might be a problem for connecting to some instruments requiring complete replacement of the plug.  Otherwise, these probes are everything you expect from Pomona, high quality and great design.  I highly recommend them.",A MUST HAVE for modern SMT electronics,1520380800,,,application second nice away finger cable black use onto work probe rubber way probe plug sell red wide order delicate recommend news surface extra-low-voltage clunky could energize actually might product world theyll perfect meter accommodate last rule finger tight bed-of-nails nothing high modern replacement right-angle safety-sheath anyone instrument expect professionally problem buying careful absolute tip test great note real smt oh must millimeter doesnt connect pomona genius pogo find safe little electronics set keep place slip suitable one advise new issue quality right sharp replaceable cut angle forever specialized see good situation use large grip otherwise first design lack require bit fixture want honestly guard microelectronics regulation highly result test get carry standard everything also still end complete honest safety-sheathed necessary guard receive rest else meter year recently aware pin loan gray precision tip color-coded require plug multimeter set two work old instrument without pouch kit slide go pay use available expect needle-sharp get throw three every fully-color-coded give keep youll circuitry review

I've been using an old Maverick model that isn't even available anymore, it's so old, but it is dead accurate so I've been nursing it along.  With that in mind, I jumped at the opportunity to test and review this MeasuPro TF5000 model.  This is a keeper.  It is easy to use, extremely easy to read, non-complicated, and reports the reading quickly.  It has a large display - not backlit, but very large dark numerals on a pale gray/silver background.  I can usually get an accurate reading within a few seconds, actually faster than I expected.  I can attest to its water resistance: I accidentally spilled a glass of iced tea on it yesterday, and it's perfectly fine and functioning nicely.  I also appreciate the needle-like point on the probe (and the included tight-fitting plastic sleeve) -- it makes it easy to get readings in the middle of a pork chop or chicken breast.  The probe cover also hooks in behind the unit through a slot at the top, which extends the length of the handle at a right angle.  This is VERY useful if you need to measure the temp of a pot of boiling liquid, and want to keep your hand out of the way of the rising steam.  Someone else mentioned the desirability of including a small chart of meat/poultry temps on the unit itself, and I second that motion.  There's enough space on the back to include such a chart, and it could be done in a way that wouldn't disrupt the water resistance of the unit.  But this is a small quibble for me.  Also a small quibble: it uses a type CR2032 battery which requires the removal via tiny screwdriver of a small cover on the back of the case.  My old thermometer took 1 type AA battery that I could change in seconds.  But again, this is a rather small quibble.  I haven't used this long enough to assess its battery usage, and if I notice anything particularly striking (either positive or negative), I'll update this review.  I tested this with room temperature water, with boiling water, chicken on the grill, pork chop in a counter-top contact grill, and water to be used with my bread machine.  The bread machine test was the most critical: the water temp has to be a certain temperature, or the yeast won't work.  A difference of 5 degrees can throw it off.  I'm thrilled to say that the MeasuPro passed with flying colors.  Overall, I'm extremely happy with this.  My old thermometer was in the same price range as this one when I purchased it 10 years ago, and this one is much better in some ways than my old Maverick.

YOu don't need a knife to open the tubes with caulk - they have tightly fitting caps with ""wings"" and they are easy to open because of that. The little nozzles have the same type of design, and easy to pop on and then off. The caulk that came with the kit is white, and it says it can be painted over, but I did not try that because white was that I needed. I had caulk coming off behind the kitchen sink, and was dreading of the task because of faucets in the way. The small size of the caulk gun was enough to make the job possible. The included tool for removing old caulk was very helpful, it has three ends - one for pulling, one for pushing, and a flat one for scratching off a surface. I used the former two, and it was quite easy. The caulk comes out of the nozzle fairly steady. My hands shake a lot, so the line was not perfect, but I was able to smooth everything using the glove included. I only used a part of the tube, and was able to reseal it - the package says it can be stored up to six months after opening. Only a few days ago I caulked a crack in the siding with the big caulk gun, and the difference is very clear - smaller gun plus smaller tube were so much easier to use, and I got steady flow of caulk with the new system. The caulk gun uses their proprietary tubes, and they are available for sale on amazon, but I only see white ones. Another thing I liked about the kit is the packaging - it is just as pictured, and you can store all the pieces in it neatly.","easy to use, great results.",1465344000,,,caulk cap pop much use quite packaging way smooth come steady neatly surface need try perfect one open six job proprietary thing enough opening flow gun big scratching hand caulk size glove nozzle fairly line little task tool include one reseal like part pull lot need package new tube right possible remove nozzle able easy type use day kitchen amazon design knife come side tightly month picture sale get white everything ago end small see former faucet sink dread easy paint make plus store say shake helpful two old come system store behind wing tube flat kit fit crack push job use available three difference another piece use clear small

You can adjust the truing element, with a screw knob to move the element across the stone.. However to set the depth of cut one has to adjust the bar height freehand. The tormek system has a threaded rod on one of the bar stems that allows for a height micro adjustment. That bar system as best I can tell will not fit the grizzly system, so one is stuck eyeballing the depth. This can be a critical operation because to get the best results, the cut needs to be within a margin given in the brief instructions (it's a small amount).. It can be done and it's not that hard, but it's certainly more tedious than it would be if one had a threaded height adjustment..

That being said however, there are some (fixable) shortcomings that may drive away some customers:  1. The automatic leveling is prone to failure -- it assumes good electrical conductivity between the nozzle and four corner pads.  This ignores the fact that the nozzle is often fouled with old burned plastic and other contaminants that make this hit-or-miss. 2. Some folks may like the fact that it is designed for 3mm filament (only).  I don't, in fact I use 1.75 exclusively. 3. The z-axis leadscrew nuts often ""whine"", they need lubrication, something the factory doesn't do. 4. The spool holder is off to the side, necessitating the use of a teflon tube to bring the filament to the print head.  ALL of these problems may be fixed, but they variously cost time and effort.  Check out Thingiverse (for example) to see one approach to fixing the leveling problem -- search for ""BLTouch TAZ 6"".

Following a smashed finger and orthopedic surgery, daily wraps were necessary. I treated the affected area, wrapped a thin layer of gauze in order to provide padding and absorbent material over the wound, then I slid the Tubular Gauze over and past the wounded area layering the dressing, and finally affixed the dressing with CoBan. There is a trick to using Tubular gauze. I first cut a 6"" piece, slid it over my index finger, then slid it over my wounded finger. With the excess off the end, I slid my index finger from the opposing hand at an angle in order to twist the space between the two fingers. It looked like a Chinese firecracker. Then I rolled the gauze from my index finger down over the wounded finger such that the end was sealed by the twist and there were two layers. There is unnecessarily expensive tools to properly wrap the finger too. But my method was effective, looked like a professional dressed it, and cheap. I found this to be so cost effective and useful that I now stock it in my first aid kit. A waitress was injured from broken glass and I dressed her finger with this.

People probably wonder whats all the hype about when it comes to these things.  Well if you glued up wood on a regular basis then you would know.  There are surprisingly few options for spreading wood glue.  I think using acid brushes are the most common method.  Even though acid brushes have been used for a long time for this purpose.  They have never been a great solution for spreading wood glue in things like rabbits, dados, dovetails, dowel holes, mortises, box joints, and so on.  Simply because the little bristles on the acid brushes always seem to come off and end up trapped in the glue on your work piece and you are left trying to pick them out of the glue.  Also an acid brush can only be used once and it has to be thrown away because there is no way to clean them.  With these silicone brushes though.  That same brush can be used over and over again.  Wet wood glue can simply be washed off the bush with water, or you can just opt to let the brush sit while the glue completely dries over night and peel the wet glue off the brush the next day.  I prefer the later as its easy and the glue tends to peel off in one fell swoop.  Best thing about these brushes is they don't leave bristles in the wood.  If you have not already done it people.  Throw away those acid brushes and rollers and pick this kit up.  You won't regret it.  As someone who glues up wood on a daily basis.

I made it about a day before I decided to void the warranty and modify it so I can't comment much on the stock configuration, but I can say with mods this is an amazing little printer.  Some draw backs are that mine came with a 7a power brick, and with this it struggled to heat the bed over 60c with extruder running.  Out of the box this printer is good for PLA only, and it prints PLA well.  YMMV at best with other filaments.  To overcome the limitations out of the box I completely replaced the electronics in mine with an MKS 1.4 board running marlin 2, and went with a bigger power supply, upgraded the heated bed wiring etc...  So with an extra $50 invested over the purchase price this is now a high performance printer.  So for $200 set your expectations accordingly.

1030,21743,4,False,"09 13, 2009",AVPNQUVZWMDSX,B001CX4JSS,,esanta,"Sonicare and Oral-B are the two largest manufacturers of high-end powered toothbrushes. They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.  Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B's rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.  Sonicare's most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.  After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.  The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.  The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare's. I don't know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you're supposed to only apply it gently. Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the ""quad-pacer,"" essentially a timer that signals you when it's time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds) Battery life is about a week. Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.  PROS ---- - a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets - very low price for this technology - easy to clean - small charging stand - small brush, great for little hands - quad pacer - setting for sensitive gums CONS ---- - may be too small for some hands - charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas) - no travel case  CONCLUSION ---------- Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don't move the brush back and forth, don't push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing.","At last, an alternative to Sonicare",1252800000,9.0,,know adapter cheap holder oral-b's hard move toothbrush clearly sonicare's find use tendency teach vibration charge periodontal feature markedly result listerine brush sell transformer charger model space dentist weak powerful travel market week come need half properly worthy actually tooth regardless perfect completely useful action job hold battery least tight couple double brush get redesign nothing challenger pro several manufacturer thing braun/oral-b quadrant con generation take overseas great please feel gum different hand target real clean technology enter impact technology size less clinically glorified brush line apply flexcare little task polisher anymore include conclusion rinse push package ultrasonic back place angle bonus regular rotary similar far recent low let high-end good setting limited type efficiency attempt fit gum moniker design update price signal interstitial sensitive thin almost timer early millimeter time switch consideration pulsonic bulky call disgust degree standard also proven thin suppose late finally proper quad closer slow clean easy inside include forth oral-b pocket antique quad-pacer accumulate second choose case large gunk initially whereas since sonicare best two body-brush require toothbrush power system life include gently body impossible fight plaque disease ask heavy pacer floss use essentially unpleasant hit charge apply every may thorough shipping hybridize small stand

The length of the cable creates the capability to access many hidden or hard to reach locations so the back and interior of a variety of things may be easily viewed. It also comes with a small group of accessories to help view and retrieve lost items and obstructions.  With an ingress rating of IP67, the camera is completely protected against dust intrusion and is immersion protected for short periods of time in water. The information I found elsewhere which explained the definition of this rating defined pressure and time limitations of up to 1 meter (just over three feet) of submersion with a test duration of 30 minutes measured at the bottom of the cable, and at least 15 cm (about six inches) measured at the top of the device. I did not have a clogged pipe to thread this camera through but I won't hesitate to do it next time it happens.  After reading the included User Manual I copied the enclosed 3 inch CD to my laptop hard drive. The disc contains three applications and when I double clicked on the first one it said no capture device available so I plugged the endoscope into my USB port and the message went away but the screen was blank except for some menus. So, I closed that window and double clicked on the second application and it was also a blank screen with some menus, so I closed that one too.  When I double clicked on the third application the screen opened and the picture from the endoscope was in view. From there I tested the camera in a variety of locations and followed the instructions to capture snapshots which I have attached to this review. The software can also be used to create videos.  In addition, there was a .rar file on the included disc that when uncompressed contains a program called ViewPlayCap which can be installed on a PC by running the setup file. It is much easier to use than the other three applications on the disc. If interested in loading this program the user will need software to uncompress a .rar file such as 7Zip.  The LED lens is bright and has a wheel adjustment control on the USB plug so the light may be set for best advantage in different conditions. I removed a floor vent cover and saw bug remains in the ductwork. Then I checked behind the dryer for dust, and found some (and cleaned it, of course) but it did not make a very compelling photo so I took a picture of the label on the back of the dryer to show the clarity of the image. And finally, I took a picture behind some audio video equipment. This area is always difficult to get at and the endoscope provided a way to check empty ports and confirm tight connections.  The cost is modest considering many 16 foot cables alone are priced in this range. This endoscope has many uses and the only limitations I noticed were minor. When used in a large space the cable was difficult to precisely direct so time was required to maneuver it into position. But, it is perfect to thread into tight spots, like a car engine, and with patience, it works just fine in larger openings.

My first printer was a makerfarm Mendel i2. I love working with my hands so of course I started with a kit to build myself. I actually found the experience so stressful, I thought I could do a better job and made kits to sell on ebay and craigslist for a while. Prices have come down, but I used to always sell them (KITS) for around $500, and they were no where near as sturdy as a printer like this. The nice thing about the open source kits is that you could infinitely customize them, and while there are a lot of designs on thingiverse for this printer, it's functionality is relatively limited. This is probably a GOOD THING for most people. For any handy person (that receives a printer that is not damaged from the beginning) you will be able to get printing pretty quickly. I wholeheartedly recommend installing opensource firmware (do your reseach on the voltivo forum, look for how to install ""repetier"" on it) and you will have much more customization (including using any filament type and brand at any temperature).  I got this printer after selling my last workhorse of a printer, a Prusa i3 with dual extruders (I could never get the dual extruder to be reliable enough to use), and I got it thinking I would hotwire it with my own opensource electronics (Arduino MEga + RAMPS 1.4). But as it turns out, the electronics are already an Arduino derivative and you can simply upload firmware. I played around with the idea of getting a ""filament resetter"" and similar devices, but it's just not worth it, IMO. If you're tech savvy enough to get repetier firmware on it, you'll be able to get the original firmware back on it if you really wanted.  I have the single and dual, and while I don't usually use the second extuder, I would highly recommend it if you're thinking you want to do dual material (you probably won't and shouldn't) or use a secondary material as a removable support material. Dissolvable support materials like PVA are expensive and a pain, but the only way to do it. If you can get your hands on the support material from another printer like a Stratasys (at 10x the price of even PVA) you can really make it work, it's just expensive. The single extruder model is probably best for 95+% of people.  The printer is quite large, but encasing it makes it print much better ABS parts, removing a lot of warping and cracking issues. Printing large parts requires ABS ""juice"" (a small amount of ABS filament dissolved in acetone, smeared on the bed and allowed to dry). Read the instructions and you'll get some quality prints right away. Make sure there's no damage when you receive it or you deserve the headache that will follow.","3D printing expert - pretty darn good, price is a steal",1424649600,5.0,,removable second hotwire nice think upload encase away play much person derivative i've think use quite work dual amount price way like sell model recommend dry require handy headache start could near come turn simply actually arduino usually receive print wholeheartedly expensive open job last extruder get tech follow sturdy thing enough deserve forum sure already sell device hand want pva pain firmware well source find reseach print read brand electronics really extruders course damage love acetone lot back quality original make right functionality imo relatively remove similar savvy infinitely material able installing own good single limit type opensource use probably quickly worth large allow instruction stratasys first print repetier makerfarm printer price crack want ebay highly printer design get would stressful dozen workhorse part damage bed issue mendel thingiverse prusa material juice dissolvable even voltivo temperature smear craigslist reliable install warp abs idea make experience extuder mega never build built begin around customize filament resetter best work receives customization look include secondary make there's dissolved kit people ramp kit use always get another small pretty support

While it does cost more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.  The Good: Smooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood. Pointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole. No counterpunch or pre-drilling required to achieve accuracy. The shank is formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review). Markings are highly visible and easy to read. The quality workmanship of this product is obvious: sharp, finely machined, highly visible markings.  The Bad: There really isn't anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking The bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bit had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).  Summary: If you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.  If you like short reviews - stop here!  On the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on  The bit has a hex shank for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. This #2 bit also fits in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine has a six sided shank, also known as a hex shank.  Irwin Unibit #2: Irwin Item #: 10232 Hole Sizes: 3/16 - 1/2 Step increment: 3/8 Number of steps: 6 Step Height (i.e. max material thickness): 3/8 Overall Length: 3-1/8 Shank Size Across flats: 1/4 Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4  I happen to own some low cost import step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.  When is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?  When drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced. Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough. When a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit. Its possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes. If you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 wider starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered. Smooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter). A single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.  When is a standard metal drill bit better?  When you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece. In thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just aren't designed to do this.  Other details and observations:  Use step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical. Enlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged. You can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole. I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 thick fir plywood when I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2 holes you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bit cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless. One review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction. In hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results.

I prefer many smaller pieces as to one large piece because it's easier to apply them. Remove the backing to the tape and apply the sheet to the print bed. The tape will be very tacky at that temperature and you should be very careful to correctly orient the sheet on the print bed. It you have to trip the sheet, do so beforehand.

On one hand it's nearly perfect, but there's at least one thing to be noted.  When you rotate the selector from Off to VAC for example, you'll eventually get in a situation where you didn't rotate it enough while you thought you did, because you felt the knob give and saw the display light up.  When it's not rotated enough you'll see a lightning bolt and four dashes.  When it's correctly rotated to VAC, you'll see 0.0 V AC on the display.  Because I didn't know what to look for when I first got it, I touched it to a live electrical circuit while not being properly rotated to VAC, and I only saw ""- - - -"".  So my first thought was the circuit was not active, which is bad.  My experience is user error, but in my opinion, the device should not display anything until the knob is rotated into the correct position.  Also the clamp needs to be completely closed to get an decent reading of Amps, but that's just my bad.

Part of learning is learning to make objects in small sections and then join them together.  Aside from patience and experience the biggest challenge is changing colors.

This is really a fantastic set for teaching fractions and decimals - both how various fractions correspond to one another and how decimals correspond to the fractions. Most of our fraction sets are pie-shaped, which is great. But, the circle does not always match what is needing to be taught. Having the linear visual option is fantastic, as is having the two-sided tile to allow fractions and decimals to either be shown on their own or mixed for comparison.  The plastic is sturdy.

1227,49028,5,True,"01 29, 2017",A138AUCM5CTEDP,B00I8NM6JO,,MIT Guy,"This is a great 3d printer, if you want the least amount of hassle and the shortest learning curve, this is the one. My only strong recommendation, is that you buy simplify 3d with it.  3d printing takes much trial and error. Different filaments, different temp settings, different slicing software, etc etc. FFCP takes a lot of that out of the equation.  My recomendendations:  1. Buy Simplify 3d 2. Start with PLA. ABS can be very difficult to master and the benefits are few over PLA 3. Use Hatchbox filaments. This is very important. Heat bed to 60 deg, and use 205 for filament. Buy it here from Amazon. Wait for Prime stocks so you don't over pay. 4. 3d prints of high quality take a long time to print. Avg 6 hrs.  However, once you see a HQ 3d print, you will never want to use anything else. Bottom line: patience. 5. Level the bed very well before you print. I cannot stress this enough. LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL  ! 6. Make sure the first things you print are a filament feeder and a bigger spool feeder. Go on Thingverse for STL plans. You will these before you do anything else. 7. You will almost never use the dual extruders. The only benefit is that you can use two filaments of different types ready to go. 8. Always unload the extruder if you are not going to use the printer for more than a week. 9. Keep the door and top cover on when printing. Heat retention is your friend. 10. Experiment with your slicing settings. Don't accept default values. They are typically the wrong ones for your printer. 11. Try to print things vertically. Vertical printing is always more accuarte. Even if some instruction states to print something flat, always flip it vertically. 12. After you get some time on the stock nozzles, upgrade to some micro swiss nozzles. Huge difference. Do not go full metal. It's not needed and it will screw up you temperatures. 13. The blue stock print surface works great. Don't listen to all the idiot's out there that recomend all kinds of other stuff, glass, PEI, Kapton, etc. The key is keeping your surface clean. Clean with denatured alcohol after each print. Let dry. Always use a raft. I don't care what they say about not using one. ALWAYS USE A RAFT !. When it's truly not sticking anymore replace with a new one. I get about 20 prints before I need to replace. 14. Always preheat. That is so important. Both bed and extruder.  OK so here are some cons:  1. Nozzles will need to be replaced at some point. 2. The two nozzles are more than likely NOT at the same height. What this means is that one may ""knock"" into the other ""structures"" when printing and ruin the print. The solution here is either remove extruders and rebalance the nozzles or remove the nozzle of the extruder you don't use. Either solution is simple, about 10 min total time. 3. Balancing the table takes several attempts. I use feeler guages. They are more accurate. 4. Loading and unloading the filament becomes a chore, but it's something that needs to be done. 5. The table is actually small, as your appetite for bigger projects grows. You will have to get creative wit layouts. 6. The cooling could be improved. Several mods are available online. 7. Do not use the provided spools. The quality is very low and it has led to numerous clogs. Use Hatchbox for both PLA and ABS.  Overall I love this printer. Yes, some things could be improved but the only 3d printer I would consider to be better than this one is the makergear m2. I also own that one. It's very good but also twice the price. I still find myself using the flashforge over the m2 more often than not. The m2 is great for bigger projects. I would recommend the Creator pro 2016 to anyone starting or wanting a more reliable 3d printer. Don't waste your money and time on anything else.

If you are very careful never to allow the free end to ""collapse"" onto the roll and always fold over an about 1"" section when done for a new ""starter"", it works fairly well without a dispenser or even scissors.  However, if you use it with a cheap dispenser (which comes with some packaged versions), it is easy for the free end to collapse onto the roll. If that happens, it is almost impossible to restart the roll, because its tendancy to ""slivering and splitting"".  EZ-tape adheres well to paper, but is not ""extra-wide household tape"".  It does not adhere well to itself nor to non-paper articles.  For example, it would NOT be suitable for temporarily bundling a dozen poles together, sealing a tear in a vinyl raincoat, temporarily waterproofing a cracked taillight, temporarily reinforcing a cracked window, nor any number of other household uses that ordinary 2"" wide clear tape is useful for.

It is unusually easy to install in the dispenser, unwinds unusually easy and quietly, and cuts unusually easy.  If you do alot of packaging in a quiet environment, such as a library, then this tape may be advantageous, it does not ""screeeeeech"" as it comes off the roll.  Some brands of tape require real muscle to pull off the roll, and so, a day of sealing boxes can be a workout.  The EZ tape rolls off the roll almost effortlessly---so much so, that you may have to find ways to slow it down with some professional dispensers (an easy adjustment with most).  HOW TO RESTART ROLLS Place a piece of tape (ideally masking tape) perpendicularly across the EZ tape near the end.  Rub the masking (or other) tape to insure maximum adhesion.  As slowly as you can, peel up the end of the EZ tape back to the masking (or other) tape.  Because of the slivering, you may have to peel back 5 or 5 ""slivers"".  Then peel off the ""unit"" held together by the masking tape.

I have used vibrating ultrasonic types like Sonicare, and the rotary type brushes like those by Oral B, and they each have good points, as well as shortcomings.  The vibrating brush works well for general cleaning, while the rotary type is generally better for focusing on specific hard to reach area.  I bought the Sonicare Healthy White R732 because it was $70 as a Deal of the Day, saving about $50.  After some really bad experiences with short battery life, I had switched from Sonicare to Oral B.  However after several unfavorable checkups, I decided to give Sonicare another try.  The powered handle has three brushing modes, ""Clean"", ""Sensitive"", and ""Clean and White"".  Pushing the power button, cycles through the three modes.  The first two last 2 minutes, and the third runs 30 seconds longer.  The modes vibrate at different frequencies, but they basically feel the same to me.  It is recommended that you spend 30 seconds brushing each quadrant in your mouth, and the brush beeps every 30 seconds, to let you know when to move on the next quadrant.  The timer function is remarkably accurate, and consistent.  This model comes with two types of toothbrushes, the ""standard"" and the smaller ""compact"".  The feel of the vibrating ultrasonic brushes is about the same, but having a choice is a nice option.  The compact brush is more maneuverable, and better for getting at some hard to reach areas, like the back teeth.  The Sonicare R732 generally does a decent job of cleaning, and really stimulates the gums.  The handle has a light that indicates when the battery is running down, and needs to be charged.  Recharge time is quick, and the charging stand also has provisions for holding two brushes.  Unfortunately both the handle and the brushes are pretty easy to tip over.  The base has a removable top, with a spool for winding the power cord inside.  This is kind of a clever idea, but not entirely successful, as all of the cord can be accommodated.  Also included is a handy plastic travel case for the handle and brushes.  Sonicare's claim that this brush will whiten your teeth ""two shades whiter"" is probably an overstatement.  The brush does a fairly good job of cleaning, but of course supplementary cleaning, like flossing is still required.  Overall, I'm fairly happy with the unit, but I'm hoping that the battery does not crap out prematurely, as has happened with the previous Sonicares I have owned.  Unlike Oral B's rotating brushes, there do not appear to be any less expensive generic alternatives, for the Sonicare brush heads, which run about ten bucks each.  The results of modern dentistry can be impressive, but the costs of the newer dental technologies can get quite high.  Referrals to specialists for procedures like root canals, implants, and bridges, can also add to your costs.  Replacing a tooth can easily run $1000 for a crown, or $4000 for an implant.  Now more than ever, practicing good dental hygiene, might save you a bundle in future dental bills.  The cost of the Sonicare or any other quality powered brush isn't insignificant, but spending a few hundred now, could possibly save a few thousand later.","not the ""ideal"" powered toothbrush, but an effective tool in the never ending battle against plaque...",1351296000,3.0,,give know removable implant frequency nice hard power move toothbrush plastic bill prematurely cost implant base sonicare's practice buck quite sonicares shortcoming type longer button whiten save like result dental brush ever hundred spending model however ideal floss handy generally maneuverable travel compact clever canal add could agree tooth might try overstatement shade spool expensive whiter function successful beep cost job remarkably area battery next last unit brush consistent get mouth stimulate indicate claim high statement point manufacturer several modern happen recommend tip run dentistry gum third different minute teeth feel possibly clean later recharge well happy cord less technology unfortunately handle brush unlike fairly really b's replace mode course include entirely ultrasonic back future quality deal alternative accommodate generic impressive rotary let option crown hold kind bundle own good experience type quick use probably charge first design accurate come light ten sensitive timer decide time spend top white standard rotate vibrate bad general also decent checkup area still crap bridge small hygiene work clean inside easy easily day basically root provision specialist second buy reach idea referral case hop supplementary choice head short insignificant need switch unfavorable run appear i'm sonicare oral overall procedure two quadrant toothbrush require previous powered life run specific thousand newer well push cycle focus get charge another three save every healthy winding pretty vibrate stand

There's a lot of things that can go wrong, so they are potentially very dangerous. I didn't realize the first time I used them when you get to the very top of the lift, the weight of the jacks themselves will tend to push the wall over. I was trying to stop the wall from moving, and both of the jacks in  unison were fighting against me. I was very lucky that one edge of the top plate caught against an adjacent wall long enough for me to pull the jack out of place. I would have lost the wall otherwise.  After that first little adventure I started to tie rope to the wall, but this is also a case of controlled chaos. If your ropes are too long, they can stretch, and the bottom of the wall can kick in and go over too. I find it best to get the walls within about 3 inches of plumb, brace the wall and get rid of the jacks. Then, and only then, push the wall into plumb.  These are very handy, but I would advise anyone using them to start with small walls (10') or so before approaching anything much heavier.  I can also say it takes about 45 min. to set everything up vs. about 15 min. with a helper. Of course if you have no helper, these are gold.

It takes several hours to assemble the printer.  The instructions are good enough.  The parts seemed to be good at first but as I assembled the printer I found some defects. 1) One of the guide bars had some deep grinder or  machine tool marks so the bearing did not slide smoothly.  I'd say about 1mm deep in multiple places along a 10mm length of the bar. (See photo) 2) One of the four linear bearings was broken, loose balls and non-round hole.  Would only ""slide"" over a bar if force where applied.  They should glide with very little friction. 3) there was a dead-spot on the LCD.  The LCD screen works fine except for a 5 x 30 mm box near the top. (See photo)  I can still use the menu system, just can read part of the screen. 4) A short on the main board prevents use of the z-limit switch.  The switch itself is fine.  The main board works except for this one problem. (I was able to repair it.  It was a solder bridge under one of those micro size surface mount capacitors)  The seller does respond to emails quickly when I use the Amazon web interface to send messages.  Replacement parts however use a slow shipping method from China (not Prime shipping) I will update this review as I receive replacement parts. I was able to assemble the printer with the 3 good bearings and defective rod, the Y axis wobbles but replacement parts will fix this.  The electronics works, and I can guess what is printed on the defective part of the screen.  But the inability to home the z-axis means I have to turn the motor by hand and listen for the switch to click then edit out the auto-home command from the g-code file I want to pint.  Quite a lot of effort to make a test print on a wobbly bed.  UPDATE:  All four replacement parts arrived. (main board, LCDD, Y-Axis rod, Linear bearing)  As I type this I have just used my first spool of filament and the results are good.  You MUST check and level the bed if needed EVERY print.  When using the sample PLA filament supplied with the kit set the bed fo 60C and the nozzle to 215C print at 60mm/sec but the first player at 30mm/sec or slower.  use LOTS of glue stick on the aluminum bed.  Correct nozzle height:  Find thin paper, high quality inkjet printer paper is why to thick, place it between nozzle and build plate, You should just be able to slide the paper with friction.  You need about 0.01 mm gap.  I am getting good quality prints but.  It is not automatic.  You must pay attention to every detail and experiment with the setting in your slicer app.  Keep good notes about what works and what does not.  This printer is capable of very good prints but requires much car and attention and adjustment  I added photos of parts I made, three are printer upgrades and one is a robot ""gripper"".  I gave 2 rather than 1 star because the kit is still a good value and I have faith the issues might be resolved eventually (it might take a month).

The cord is long enough to reach across the house (50') and the crevice tool works as you'd expect.

Don't use too much gel! I have empirically determined that if you use too much gel (a thick, long continuous line as when using toothpaste) your connection will be of poorer quality - dropped signals, etc. - than if you just apply a few strategically placed, dot-like dabs at several locations along the back of the transmitter's combination chest strap/lead where it's needed.  This gel really improves contact between the Polar transmitter and the skin and thus the strength of the signal being sent to the receiver on my rowing machine when working out; only rarely is the signal dropped which results in the heart rate briefly not being displayed on the receiver. Lightly spreading and smoothing the dabs of applied gel with one finger along the back of the plastic lead before use also improves overall contact and performance.  However, if you consistently apply too much gel, you'll actually be better off and get a stronger signal by just using plain old tap water.  It certainly makes sense that a sparingly applied thick/clear gel - which is not a thin liquid and does not run like water does - will be much more likely to stay where you put it and result in the improved transmission of stronger heart rate signal.

1476,5659,5,False,"07 1, 2011",AI0BCEWRE04G0,B000BQUI7S,,Stoney,"There is a large family of Goop adhesives, ""All Purpose"", ""Automotive"", ""Craft"", ""Household"", ""Lawn and Garden"", ""Marine"", ""Plumbing"", ""RV"", ""Sport and Outdoor"", and ""Wood and Furniture"" As far as I can tell, all are identical. Some, such as ""Marine"" and ""Automotive"" may be more UV resistant. So, at least for indoor use, I suggest buying the cheapest. In the local hardware store, ""Household Goop"" is usually the cheapest. At the time of this writing, ""Plumbing Goop"" is the cheapest on Amazon. As far as I can tell, E6000 is the same as the various varieties of Goop, but packaged for industrial use.  IN GENERAL Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, very strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  EXAMPLES Examples are endless.  In addition to the examples below, I've used it to repair ceramic plant pots and shoes.  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack.  The Goop it also makes a ""cushioned"" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  I use Goop to close small holes in window screens.  I've used Goop to seal holes in air-mattresses.  ELECTRICAL Goop is far superior to electrical tape for splicing wires, re-insulating cat-chewed wires, waterproofing and vibration-proofing electrical connections.  There is a black variety of ""Shoe Goop"" if you want your repair to be less noticeable.  PLUMBING Goop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  However, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  Moreover, it takes several days for Goop to dry to reasonable strength.  If you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  It's better to wait a week.  Moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of Goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the Goop to dry.  SHORTCOMINGS 1) An opened tube thickens quickly.  Store open tubes in a small glass jar with a tight metal lid.  Old thick Goop does not work well for some uses (such as repairing shoes), but is perfect when you need a thick application--such as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line.  It is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface  2) Until it dries, Goop flows, alot.  Therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  So, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  Alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick Goop over an initial layer of new Goop.  If possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  For several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is ""repositionable"" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  Unfortunately, if you use too many layers or ""reposition"" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.  3) Except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naphtha or acetone), Goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  So, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  Although Goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  You could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  You could simply wipe off ""white glue"" and clean up with a moist paper towel.  4) The fumes are strong and toxic.  Allow glued items to dry in a well-ventilated area (ideally out-of-door) for several days.  When doing alot of gluing, I work in my carport with a large utility fan blowing the fumes away---and still usually get a nasty headache.  It is best to use gloves when working with Goop.  TO GOOP OR NOT TO GOOP While Goop is truly miraculous--there are situations when other types of glue are better choices.  White Glue:  For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is much safer, cleanup is much easier, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elmer-s-All-Multipurpose-White-Glue-7-5-8-oz-E379/dp/B0013CBH9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)</a>  Wood Glue:  Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It is much better than Goop for most wood repairs.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood.  It is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.  If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elmer-s-E701-Carpenter-s-Wood-Glue-8-Ounce/dp/B000QH5MUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-Ounce</a>  Silicon Glue:  Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations).  It is a better choice for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength.  It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier.  Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GE-Silicone-II-Household-Glue-2-8-oz/dp/B002J998DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 oz</a>  Epoxy:  When you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is a much better choice.  For joining metal ""J&B Weld"" epoxy is best.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  Fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  Epoxies are safer than Goop, and cure much quicker.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick).  Some are packaged in a dual-syringe---but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.  Previously, a major drawback was that all epoxies were colored (usually white)---but now clear epoxies are available.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-B-Weld-8265-S-Cold-Weld/dp/B0006O1ICE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J-B Weld 8265-S Cold Weld</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CLEARBOND-H-3S-Clear-Strong-Epoxy-Adhesive-Syringe-85oz/dp/B001J9J6VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85oz</a>  Super-Glue (Krazy Glue):  Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast.  In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required.  Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects.  Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, and clear epoxies have become available.  Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tightly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BAZIC-Super-Glue-3-grams-0-10-ounces-6-Per-Pack/dp/B003BSF7ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per Pack</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krazy-Glue-KG92548R-Instant-Krazy-Glue-All-Purpose-Brush-0-18-Ounce/dp/B000BQSFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krazy Glue KG92548R Instant Krazy Glue All Purpose Brush 0.18-Ounce</a>  APPLICATOR TIP If you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  If you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  If you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  If it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.

Firmware requires customization - you'll need to know or learn how to modify the firmware config and reupload. Easy if your a nerd. You'll find that some of your axis directions need to be inverted. There is no way around this, get used to the ardino IDE, you will be using it a bit. The top z-axis plates are initially very snug and you may have to sand, oil the holes that the threaded rods fit into in order to allow them to turn freely. The included spool holder introduces way too much friction/drag on the spool to allow it to turn freely. As a result you'll find yourself baby-sitting your print.

After a month of dealing with the issue and studying extruder designs I realize that the issue with this printer is that the extruder has a design flaw that makes it almost impossible to keep pressure from building up the extruder assembly. The only solution to this problem is to completely redesign the extruder maybe upgrading it to an E3D-V6 in the process.  For someone like me who isn't very good with machining this design flaw is a huge disappointment.

Looked really nice, and I read a lot of the reviews before buying it.  Let's just say the reviewers that said this switch is too big for a normal size box are dead on accurate.  It is too big, but there's an even more annoying problem than that.  The contacts inside aren't sealed from dust.  Within a couple of weeks of having it installed, I had to tear it out to clean up the saw dust inside and it ran again for a few more weeks until I failed again.  This time I tore it down completely, opened up the back side to look at the actual switching mechanism.  The neutral line contacts were so badly carbonized due to the dust intrusion that they were no longer making contact.  Cleaning them with some emery paper solved that problem, but after seeing how easily it was for dust to get inside, I decided to just not bother re-installing it.  Instead I picked up a 20A standard toggle switch and cover plate.  Now my saw is working again with a regular size box and the wires aren't crammed in there.  It's a shame really it's a nice LOOKING product, but it's design is flawed in that it isn't protected from dust intrusion, something that should be considered when it's a switch designed for tools that generate lots of dust.

I wasted a full pla spool just adjusting this to were it worked, and when it worked the prints were amazing, the quality were high and I loved it, but it didn't last long after few prints I needed to do the same procedures all over again,  $500 for this little beast is a bargain! I got this 3 days ago and I had 1 little hiccup on leveling the bed which I didn't understand the instruction so I researched online then I asked Tang from Flashforge and told me that the extruder position then the servo require calibration first then I can level bed automatically, after that I had 5 prints all amazing worked great no flaws and amazing quality, I am very happy with this machine, perfect small beginner 3d printer. 1. The building I appreciated that you can slide remove it and return it to remove the print, it make life easier and maintain the bed level intact. 2. Automatic bed leveling tool much easier bed leveling less frustration, however I wish flashforge explain more details on their manual about the extruder calibration and the servo calibration. 3. yes finally USB stick instead of SD card, I like it better, its easier to find a flash memory rather than sd card in ones home, also the flash stick last longer than the SD card and many other reasons I prefer the Flash stick over SD. 4. helpful beeping sound yes I find that very useful. 5. Flashprint the slicer that come with it, now I don't have problem with it but I am not big fan, its mimic the Makerbot slicer almost the same, the wireless function is fun but you can live without it if you want to use a better slicer, for free slicer flashprint is really good, but I use simplify3d its a payed 1 time sliver and has more options and better quality on the print if you know what you are doing. 6. the filament cartridge many find that annoying that flashforge is forcing you to use their filament however I find that flashforge filament is of a very good quality, I only concerned about the limited colors, however you can still use external filament and it works great, that is your choice as a user. 7. color, I like red color it look fancy on this printer but I do wish you have multiple color options its just me being spoiled haha.  last thing is the blue tape that flashforge has on the build platform I wish they start selling these for all their printer types on amazon, they are really good and helpful in obtaining a better print quality and please sell them at reasonable price.  Update 8/25/2016 after 4 month of using this printer I don't recommend this printer though it has great resolution and quality prints the problem is leveling the build plate is a lot of hassle and there is no spare parts if it broke, I been looking for a replacement for the build plate for about 2 month  Update8/30/2016 yet again I pumped it to 4 star now, here is my experience so far and why I gave it 5 star, I have all falshforge printer as I mentioned earlier, this one gave me little trouble in bed leveling but I fixed it and discovered how to bypass the auto bed leveling using simplify3d. also the buildtak is not efficient I removed it and used the glass with washable glue and it worked perfectly , however their is something called ""printafix"" that sadly only sold in Europe is a good cold bed adhesive for PLA and work wonders, but since in USA we don't have it yet Elmar washable glue work great. I still believe this need improvement on the bed leveling system. as for the parts they still need to sell these parts on their site or any other place, I needed a new build plate and had to email Tang and buy the last one they had here in the states. else next time I have to email them and they will ship it from china, I believe there should be spare parts available for this printer. for quality this printer give amazing quality, I have videos on my YouTube channel I will get  the link here soon",good but 1 thing could turn it to nightmare,1466035200,3.0,,flashprint falshforge pro cold star wonder dislike bypass selling reasonable understand ever define fine actually try one resolution time spoil last get many thing building reason dreamer sure level different happy bargain star fun adhesive really position turn annoy original usb right point far yes soon believe easy home limit tang video buildtak almost usa flaw actual degree procedure everything ago sd work finally creator fancy remove elmar sound servo experience run stick dislike without system call return site tell remove every small wish review know give move fixed much waste thought type like sell level come beeping might useful china reach problem color trouble sell ask color tune well long print hope see one drop love new memory intact sweet perfectly random day first pay amazon appreciated time auto buy also still area link maintain spare explain user washable instruction reach external choice build glue since filament yet though slide ask use plate adjust rather give force use work longer europe slicer red automatically however recommend haha automatic prefer need obtain flashforge spool reality next extruder cartridge replacement bad calibrate big research suppose less little platform thing offer lot quality discover place improvement distance manual free good quick online use print pla get part wireless paper start pump concerned make look life makerbot look sliver theoretically email sense painful month option find loved mimic perfect function state glass beginner high beast something great multiple please amaze feel perpendicular earlier that's tool hiccup frustration need clockwise efficient ship live mention youtube work card machine update printer flash price want full calibration nob blue break bed printafix fan anticlockwise else hassle require sadly helpful procedure channel instead end frustrate detail available get tape

My brother has had three of his homes custom built.  I participated on the last one because he dragged me and a friend there one day and made us work.  He was installing cable back then to wire the house (a 6000 square foot with 5 bedrooms and a walk-out basement with kitchen) with Ethernet, phone and CATV.  Drilling holes everywhere and doing some sanding work and cutting as well.  Some of the work had been done by the tradesmen and had left the clean-up to us.  We swept up the sawdust and chips for hours.  I can see why you'd want one of these on a hand truck.  I have a shop vac but it's nowhere near this powerful and dragging it a round can be pain.  This machine with the integrated mobile cart is easy to move anywhere.  It is even possible with the large back wheels to back it up a stairway if you're building and working on a two story.  For me I have a little limited use for it now, I just do some things with a small orbital sander and currently on the paint on the outside of my house, the sander has a catch bag, but it's small and stuff gets through it easily.  The problem although, I don't blame this unit is the exhaust of the sander is only an inch plus I needed it close.  If you own a shop or are very handy this isn't much of a problem, Lowes or others sell adapters and there is a universal one, they sell it on Amazon as well.  I got two kinds of hose, a heavy once inch rubber hose about six feet long, a vent hose heavy duty to prevent collapse about 12 feet long.  The vent hose I slipped over the 4"" port in the dust collector, and used a screw down band to attach securely.  I hack sawed off the big end of the universal adapter to make it 4"" and used another screw down band to secure the other end.  The one inch rubber hose was then attached to the other end of the adapter, and finally to the hand held orbital sander.  I could easily wrap the hoses and hook the sander on the cart as I moved it around the areas of the home exterior that needed sanding, nice!  Not much escapes this thing which is good because some old paint contains lead, and you would not want to breathe it in.  I used to paint for a living prior to my college days and the sanders we used just spun the paint chips everywhere. We breathed them in got them all over the body and had to wash every night to clean them up.  I took to wearing a mask and long sleeves which was contrary to the summer heat.  In addition, they were often in places hard to clean up around the customers home, so they just had to live with part of the mess.  I didn't want my bushes nourished by paint dust and chips, so the original plan for my shop vac became using this collector.  I think it saved me some time and effort after I rigged the sander.  Note, I was originally going to use duct tape with the adapter and hoses, but unless you want the thing semi-permanent, (and I'll try this with other power equipment in the future) these screw down band clamps remove easily. They come in many  sizes, and depending on which ones you buy can fit multiple diameters.  The 4"" main vent hose is good for all, but you may need to buy more adapters and secondary hoses depending on the kind of equipment you buy.  Make sure the hoses you buy are heavy duty or they could collapse under the suction.  Of course if you have 4"" larger shop equipment this discussion would be moot for that.  Some people talked about how quiet it was so I did a test, I have a sears shop vac, a Samsung high powered sweeper, an Electrolux sweeper, and a Tri-Star one of the earliest floor vacs with power head that didn't lose suction based on its design.  It used a different tech well before the Dyson which spins the dirt in a circle away from the exhaust port, it worked until the chamber was getting full, they you had to dump it to get your suction back.  One by one I turned them on and off and the dust unit.  I think it took second place behind the Samsung upright, but it beat the shop vac, the Electrolux and the older Tri-Star.  Not a bad feat considering it had the largest motor by far, I'm going physical size not hp rating here,  If you run saws and large sanders, drill presses, jig or band saws, I dare say they will all drown out the sound of this dust collector.  The verdict is it's fairly quiet.

Scott Pope,"After having a bottle of Gorilla Glue sitting around unopened for over a year, I decided to use it on three repair projects.  The first was for multiple joints on a flimsy Ikea Malm chest of drawers.  The second project was the reattachment of a shoe sole. Both projects were successful. However, the significant expansion of this polyurethane adhesive caused quite a mess.  This degree of expansion (~4X), while beneficial in many regards, is something every user should anticipate.  As an experiment, I also tried Gorilla Glue on third item - a plastic handle of a pair of scissors. This was a failure as the glue didn't hold for more than a few uses.  Gorilla glue was particularly effective on repairing my Ikea chest of drawers that had multiple broken joints. Where these joints had failed around the metal fasteners, chips of particle board broke free. Most were too small to recover and reattach.  The expansion of polyurethane filled the voids.  In fact, I which I used Gorilla glue when I first assembled it as the breaks probably would have never occurred in the first place.  The second repair project was for a shoe with a sole that had delaminated.  After being gouged by the only shoe repair shop within a reasonable distance of my residence, I decided to do this repair myself.  My concern originally was that I didn't have a hydraulic press to provide adequate compression during the drying process.  Fortunately, I was able to find two hardware clamps that worked well.  At the time, I didn't realize how important this was as Gorilla Glue expands so much that without mechanical clamps, too much polyurethane would have formed between the sole and body of the shoe. Hence, I was surprised to find a fairly significant mess the next morning as the expanded glue leaked out and dried onto the sides of the sole.  While this mess was an irritation, the sole had remained firmly attached.  The third repair was with a cheap pair of scissors with plastic handles.  As I expected, the bond didn't hold.  Presumably, Gorilla Glue is more suited to porous materials.  Summary of Results:  1) Ikea Malm chest of drawers: Gorilla Glue worked well for the repair of the broken particle board and the securing of the metal pegs in the still intact sections.  Some mess due to the expansion.  Two weeks later and it is still rock solid. 2) Repair of shoe sole: Major mess due to the significant expansion but sole is still attached very securely.  The yellowish adhesive that was squeezed out to the perimeter is very noticeable as it dripped down the sides and expanded further. 3) Repair of plastic scissor handle: Didn't hold.  It appears that lack of a large, porous area made Gorilla glue a poor choice, which is what expected in the first place.  Will try a cyanoacrylate alternative.

The self charging Lumacell that uses ambient light to charge is great as there is no replacement of batteries required. There is a top and bottom solar panel that use the ambient light in the room to charge the cell.  I put it on a sunnier side of my dining/kitchen area so that it can charge during the day. We have a dog and there is a distinct doggie smell that lingers in the area with the pet dishes and where he lounges all day. We don't notice it but visitors surely do, and so it's nice to have this air freshener that gives out small quantities of fragrance without over powering the room.  The design makes it easy just to place on a tall bookshelf, rather than screw it or stick it on the wall, so I took the easy way out. I also changed the power button to the no lock version provided so it's easy to open. For public spaces where there is danger of theft there is a key that can be used to open the inner chamber for replacing the fragrance and/or changing the settings.  This is the dispenser only and the fragrances have to be purchased separately. I received 2 Ocean Breeze cans for testing, but if they work well I wouldn't mind buying more.

Calibration works best if you use wash sample 4.01 than to sample 4.01 with temp prop and repeat. this meter is not junk it does take a little time to read to higher level the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is faster but not has accurate but close.  the Milwaukee MW102 PH unit is a basic PH meter with temp sample field unit good price in market for what it is--(no data sd card slots etc...). thanks milwaukee. (if the unit goes bad or anything i will post it so far so good).  unit is runing ok so far had to re calibrate (did it several) times with wash 4.01 and the test 4.01 etc.. and the meter sames to be reading +/- about 2 or 3 more close to 2. the meter works well just wish it would find its calibration zone faster. there are times where is just struggles to find the calibration and the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is all ready there. I have ordered cleaning solution to see if this helps.  ok i am returning this unit the 102 and will try the Milwaukee 105 pro model. the 102 just too many time takes to long to find it self to many times, eats up way to much time and i have to 2nd check it (so if i check 50 pools a day this meter will kill me... maybe probe change or broad but i can not use it working like this.  i will update on the Milwaukee 105 pro after using it i will update findings.  OK Milwaukee 105 pro works great. We had to call the company and get a replacement probe for unknown reason the 1st probe was faulty. the tech guys at Milwaukee are very helpful and help us with new replacement probe.  the Milwaukee 105 reads a little faster it sames than the 102 but the run is at time very close. BUT it works very well and both PH and TEMP are displayed on screen with this unit makes it nice to not have to switch screens. (the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is faster). this test is great for bench and table work. (after calibration this 105 meter was 100% on the money 4.00 and 7.00 and reads with a very high degree accuracy.  Final NOTE: Both units 102 and 105 Milwaukee's are (2 points) calibration the  Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is a (3 point) we called many companies for the answer and we are told that 3 points calibrate faster and many companies are moving to the pens and 3 point and auto cal from factory like the  Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 this pen has factory calibration without any butter set by the factory watch you can at any time set it back to factory ((we checked factory and it is right on for 4.0 ((not 0.00)) that good. like to see other meters have this option.  conclusion: 102 and 105 Milwaukee's are (2 points)slower than (3 points) work great.

This was painted on a new garage floor, I used the clear coat over the color for additional durability and added a couple extra boxes of color chips for the look I wanted and 'hideability'.  The epoxy holds up very well, I don't have any scratches through the color but I do have many light scuffs to the clear top coat from abuse and using my garage as a garage, in the right light you can see the scuffs but the floor still looks great.  If you do a lot of grinding or welding this product probably isn't the best option for you.  I do a little welding, cutting and grinding here and there.  The hot sparks tend to 'melt' into the floor but the scattering of color chips hides this nicely.  Sweeps up very easy, way better than bear concrete.

These discs are good and thick with 5 layers. Many discs on Amazon or Harbor Freight are very thin with just 2 or 3 layers of abrasive sheets stacked together. Pay close attention to the number of layers looking at disc wheels from the side. From a vertical line count the layers. The more layers there are, the longer they will perform better as they wear down through the disc. The cheapie ones have 3 and the higher quality ones have 5 or more layers. Also compare the cloth thickness of the layers. For many discs on the market the price is all over the place. Ranging from $3.50 to $8.00 each and most are the cheaper thin ones. Don't be fooled by the price. The big home improvement stores rip you off for these discs and they are usually thinner. These discs are balanced fairly good, and the price is good. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is, it seems that they might vibrate some when they are used aggressively. I use them mostly for pre-cleaning mill scale on steel before welding. I know most of you old hands know how hard mill scale is to remove. (But for newbies, for scale removal where some scratches are not important, start out with a 36 grit wheel). These also work well on rust, grinding down welds and just about anything else. Always wear good eye protection, a proper fitting respirator, and hearing protection when using grinders.

Bottles are true Boston rounds, nice weight, caps with flat inner seal (I assume cardboard covered with a water-resistant material). I use these 30ml bottles for my DIY ejuice. They do not leak.  I also have the blue cobalt 30ml bottles with the glass eye dropper caps. Those are nice bottles too if you need an eye dropper. I prefer the brown Boston round with the standard caps b/c I use 100% VG which is very thick. I found it very messy using the eye dropper caps as whenever you pull the dropper from the bottle, it's coated with VG and it doesn't run off quickly, so there is no tidy way to transfer liquid with a dropper cap. If I need to use a dropper I prefer to use a separate one where I can just dip the tip in to extract the juice without the dropper being coated in it. But mostly I use a subtank mini and just pour juice from the bottle directly into the tank, so the dropper became inconvenient as I had to pull it out then set it down, making even more of a mess.  The other reason I prefer the brown Boston rounds to the Cobalt Blue Boston rounds is, I can see through these a little easier when adding VG to make new ejuice. I typically fill them to the shoulder and I can see to do that using the brown bottles if the light is right. The cobalt blue bottles are darker and harder to see where the juice line is, making them less convenient for how I use them. If you are someone who measures everything out then that wouldn't matter. But it's also easier to see how much juice is left in a brown bottle, than the blue ones.

Chances are the phrase vacuum cleaner is far too limiting.  I know of no other vacuum cleaners that can do as much and do it as well.  That includes models that are twice the price models and one with better ratings.  If reading the following result of my objective tests and subjective comments, stop now because I have found no other vacuum cleaner that perfoms as well nor so feature rich with its helpful tools and accessories.  The value of a Shark is that it works and works better than most if not all other cleaners.  Normally, I only compare two vacs with each other.  For this review, I chose three; however, I am not at liberty to divulge the names of the other two.  To differentiate among the 3 cleaners I will call them S, H and M.  The S is for Shark  It comes packed well and modestly heavy.  The box is crammed with every tool I could ask for and will use sooner or later.  Our little home has about 1,600 sq. ft. of carpeting and maybe 300 sq. ft. of tile.  No shoes are permitted.  Dogs must wipe feet before entry - fat chance on that one.  Who me?  Wipe. right.  With Vac H, I cleaned the back rooms of the home.  As soon as I finished and gulped 2 pain pills, I re-Vacced using the S.  Science in not intended here, but for comparison sake the S picked up about 25% more than the H, a highly touted cleaner with similar features and power.  The next day, I cleaned the remainder of the floors.  Model M first and about as heavy as the Shark.  {This is my second reference to weight.  The Shark is a sturdy, hefty powerhorse that does not weigh as much as it appears to weigh due mainly to weight distdribution and welll placed wheels.  Model M has a similar profile and uses fabric bags.}  Same routine with one slight modification:  the Shark picked up about 35% more debree.  Features of value: -  It really does NOT loose suction -  The handle has all the right buttons in the right place. -  It is 3 cleaners for almost any use I can think of. -  Tools in a handy bag. -  Dog hair motorized brush is slick and effective. -  Floor pad for hard surfaces.

I have a 3D Delta printer that was very hard to set up, and would not give even slightly decent prints without some pretty serious modifications, so I thought I would try this one.  After I took care of a couple of minor issues created in shipping (more on that later), the printer just works and performs like I hoped it would.  I received the printer 8 days ago and it has been running pretty much 24 hours a day since then with no problems that weren't of my own creation.  So far I have printed with two colors of PLA filament, and one color of ABS.  The first thing I did was level the bed per the instructions (they are not great, but understandable).  the printer is shipped with a test print on the bed that was very nice.  Getting the first print set up using PLA filament was very easy, and I was very pleased at how well it stuck to the supplied blue tape.  There was an initial issue with the X axis printing (see the right test cube in the picture), but I quickly traced it to a loose pully on the X axis stepper motor and tightened the set screws and got the beautiful test cube on the left.  Quick pros:  Quick Cons: Very easy to set up  A couple of easily fixed issues from shipping Makes beautiful prints  The filament holder is a bit cheesy, and allows the filament to tangle a bit easily Prints PLA and ABS with heated bed  I intend to write much more on this review, but thought I would get it started.

Parts are laser cut, and self jigging so alighnment, for the most part, is not an issue. It takes some tweaking and some trial and error, but in the end it is worth it. I am still learning how best to print things.  One thing to pay attention to is the fact that the left and right frame members are NOT identical. One side is drilled for the motherboard, and the other side is drilled for the power supply. It is not very obvious. If you get the left and right side swapped, then the wiring becomes very interesting, because the frame has wiring channels cut in, and reversing the location of the power supply and motherboard negates all of those convenient channels!  Another thing to pay attention to are the stepper motors. They look identical, but in truth the extruder motor performs very differently than the X, Y, or Z motors. I was baffled at the printer's inability to print the simplest objects and the X motor's crazy, jerky performance, until I swapped it with the extruder motor to test. Once I did that, print objects started popping out of the thing like magic, and I was able to sleep at night because the motor ran so much more smoothly!  I was also resigned to rough looking objects until I discovered that I was printing in fast mode in cura. Once I switched to normal, high resolution, or ultra definition, the print layers got really thin and the objects became really smooth.

They work great when cutting holes in thin plastic as they gradually cut the hole with very little stress on the plastic.  You tighten the valve body into place with a plastic nut that compresses a silicon washer on the inside and a hard plastic washer on the outside.  This leaves a threaded hole exposed in the valve. After wrapping a generous length of teflon tape over the fine threads of the 90-degree elbow (I had to do this three times, increasing the teflon each time until the threads no longer leaked) you screw the elbow into the valve body. I stopped when the elbow faced rearward.  At this point you can insert standard 1/4"" polyethylene tubing into the elbow until it reaches its stop. If you need to adapt to 3/8"" tubing, you'll still need a short length of 1/4"" tubing to use the included 1/4"" to 3/8"" adapter/coupling. I didn't need that. You really only need 1/4"" tubing to feed the tank as you're only replenishing the 10 ounces of water used to make a single cup of coffee after each brewing. A trickle is all you need. But the valve refills the tank almost immediately.  I'd highly recommend having a main valve further down the line before the float valve. This allows you to turn the water off if you need to clean or decalcify the coffee maker or otherwise stop the water flow.

The water comes from our reverse osmosis system that supplies water to the sink and refrigerator icemaker.  This valve works well because as you can see from the pictures, the valve has to come through the top of the tank lid. This means the float arm needs to articulate. A stainless screw allows the plastic knee joint to adjust the float to suit the desired water level.  The float fits easily inside my particular Keurig with about 1/2"" to spare on either side of the float as it rides up and down on the water surface. The indicated dimensions of 45mm diameter x 74mm long appear to be accurate.  I did put a piece of Scotch tape on the lid to hold the lid onto the tank. If someone were to remove the lid, it would bring the valve out with it, the float would lower and water would start flowing. Best to lock the lid onto the tank with a piece of tape.  My previous mini-float valve worked flawlessly for more than ten years. I only retired it because the coffeemaker failed and its design called for a float that mounted on the back of the tank. This valve has to come in from the top. The valves are very simple with no parts to corrode.

2177,68734,4,False,"06 26, 2016",A2YB7DLC3FOR7W,B01FW3L6XY,{'Color:': ' White'},Pamela V,"First and foremost: I hate vacuuming.  We have hardwood and tile floors and I sweep them every day.  We have indoor cats that shed and cleaning is a constant event, so I decided to try this vacuum cleaner, mostly for the attachments.  I put the vacuum cleaner together by following the instructions.  I have to admit that some of the parts are made of plastic and I was  concerned that some of the pieces might break off as I was snapping them into place.  None did.  I put the whole thing together in about 30 minutes, and believe me, I am slow at putting things together because I am just not good at it.  The Eureka As1095A Professional Bagless Upright vacuum cleaner is white and lightweight.  The waste compartment, cord rewind compartment, and roller bar at the bottom of the vacuum are all in clear and visible compartments.  After the vacuum cleaner is assembled, you have several attachment options that all together make this a multi-tasking unit.  The cord appears to be long enough to vacuum any room in our house, and we have large rooms.  I say appears to be, because I never pulled the cord all the way out of its storage container.  I never had to.  I had plenty of cord.  There is also a handy cord retracting system that pulls the cord back inside the storage compartment, with the press of a button.  Nice.  Before starting any job with this unit, you have to choose from settings for high carpet, bare floor, and low carpet.  If you are using attachments instead of the bottom rotary device, you have to switch suctioning by way of a slider device, to choose between tools and floors.  That obviously directs the air flow to the right area.  This unit comes with several attachments, including a telescope wand, a stair & upholstery turbo brush, a regular brush, and a regular vacuum wand.  They all attach easily into a spiral hose that is hand held.  I used all of the attachments and got good suction and results from all.  I used the telescope wand the most, to get to the tops of doors & windows, hard to reach corners, behind the desk and piano, etc.  I got cat hair, some cat food, paper wrappers, spider webs, and a few live spiders.  (Sorry).  The vacuum cleaner unit glided easily behind me as I worked with the hand held attachments.  The waste holding compartment is nice because its clear and you can  see what you vacuum up.  It's easy to empty, just click out the entire front of the unit, take it outside to the trash,  slightly pull up on the clear lever to release the top on the waste compartment, then empty out the contents.  If you are looking for a lightweight vacuum cleaner with several hand held attachments, this will probably work for you.  It's a good unit.  As far as the professional claim in the name, I'm not sure.  I would recommend it for household use.  It's easy to put together, has a strong sounding motor, and sucks up anything you need sucked up, and perhaps some things you don't want sucked up - but you can remove them from the container if you need to .  That's a plus, too.  It looks good and doesn't take up much space when its not in use.  I like this vacuum cleaner mostly for the attachments and strong motor.  I can recommend it to anyone in the market for a vacuum cleaner.","Strong Motor, Nice Appearance, Easy to Assemble, Several Attachments",1466899200,13.0,,look hold nice house plastic hard air foremost admit much option storage hand use none work break button way event upright retract like result floor appear recommend space spider visible piano slow hardwood handy desk sorry market suck need attachment might motor try room cat wrapper professional job area unit brush attachment get slider high several spider claim thing enough name anyone press flow take wand sure slightly minute bar tile obviously suction cord long compartment bagless put floor food thing that's shed eureka tool entire rewind back waste make place window right whole trash hair regular rotary pull far low live hold glided believe good directs stair instruction large use work probably together outside household sweep first come want pull decide hate switch empty perhaps get would suck vacuum mostly carpet part white top paper etc content compartment indoor also top easy lightweight pull assembled see clean room clean plenty inside attach easily hose bottom suction day concern front release remove snap vacuum click turbo lever make container choose put reach cat constant never plus door i'm upholstery corner multi-tasking instead system include bare device behind sound roller telescope setting use say spiral strong piece every start look anything clear web follow

Now while it was still printing, I know from experience that pulleys need to be parallel to each other on both sides (yes they made ride left and right, but mine was curled almost 70% upwards !!!).

No matter if I make fish on the grill, in the oven or in the pan, the fish always falls apart when I remove it after it's finished cooking. I have used other foil pans, made my own foil pan from heavy duty foil by folding the sides up, but nothing works all that well as they are- too flimsy, have a rough bottom that makes the fish stick and the fish sticks even with spraying Pam on.  I prefer using foil over a pan, as the mess and falling apart is bad in a pan and even on the grill in those baskets- the fish still falls apart and sticks- not to mention the clean up later. These Reynolds pans are actually perfect for fish- smooth, shaped like a fish and there is no sticking at all- the fish literally slides out unbroken- whether on a grill or in the oven. The inside of the pan where the fish sits is only 10"" x 5""- good enough for a whole fish or two, or maybe a few smaller fillets. It is about 1 1/4 inch deep with sloping sides- great for sliding the fish out.  I find these are also great for individual dishes on the grill. We put fish in, small potatoes or other vegetables around and even a couple biscuits in- things that are small and only need 10-15 minutes to cook and everything that can cook as quickly as the fish comes out just perfect. These 3 Fish Pans cost $4.99 for 3 pans- a bit expensive, but a great convenience if you want your fish unbroken and easily slide out. They are also wonderful for entertaining as you can use one pan per person- just fill the pan with fast cooking food- they are great as you go from the grill to the table- no pans or dishes to clean up!

Overall it does an ok job cleaning, is clunkier than it has to be and requires a lot of elbow grease from the user so I decided on 3 stars out of 5.  I have used 6 or 7 carpet cleaners in the past and all did some things right and failed to hit the mark on others--even the commercial units. The sad fact is that it takes work....and a lot of it to clean carpets well. In my opinion, it is that commitment to getting the job done right which matters more than the model of cleaner you are using.  But also understand that you really do get what you pay for in a carpet cleaner so don't be cheap or you will be very disappointed. Partially this is because you are relying on the vacuum built in, so models under $100 just don't normally have the suction to remove the dirty water well.  Hoover is not new to this category but they still make some of the same mistakes. This is crazy loud to use, awkward at times to use and remove attachments and can do a poor job at vacuuming the dirty water in some situations.  So why not rate it even lower? Because most carpet cleaners suffer from substantial issues and it is more about which issues you can live with and which you can not. Loudness is something that you can get over but weak vacuuming is not.  In my use the bare floor tool was hard to install and remove and the results were very labor intensive. I do not see a difference in the results between this and my steamer which is much easier and faster to use. The fact that putting so much water on wood floors can also damage them makes this a failure at trying to be everything to everyone.  In carpet cleaning, the unit did a decent job but seemed to fail to dry the carpet as much as some other machines have. As always, the slower you go and the more times you re-do a spot, the better your results will be.","Skip it for hard flooring but if you can get past the noise, it is ok for carpet.",1415318400,25.0,,give sad spot hard awkward admit crazy much use star dirty intensive understand result floor fail model dry require substantial pay clunkier product others--even matter job time elbow everyone unit normally hoover get attachment category poor grease something disappointed clean unit well partially seem ok star floor faster labor torn thing really machine tool rate fact carpet mark model lot new right try live easy work....and loud situation slower use commercial relying cheap decide steamer fail vacuum carpet damage wise everything issue also decent still cleaner weak even clean see water hit clean user suction remove opinion install wood re-do vacuum commitment make put build overall failure mistake take bare make go suffer well use loudness past always get do difference lower

I suspect it probably isn't a big deal, and they do pick up dust quite well. They will drop a little bit of lint.  * I have no idea the relative environmental merits of paper versus flax.

When that happens worse means more cash to fix the problem. There are those who say just ""do it right"" or don't do it at all. You know who you are. I can agree with them, when there is money to use, but when there are no funds there is..... Gorilla Glue. Well here is my story.  I had a small problem that quickly spiraled into a carpenters truck payments. I had a loose toilet. Not a big deal right. Tried to usual tighter down the loose bolts. No help they just kept turning, which means the terrible and dreaded WOOOOOD ROTTTTTT. Yes Houston we have a problem. The tiolet flange that holds it in place was rotten from some sneaky water leak somewhere not visible. This insidious leak had taken its toll and caused great damage under the bathroom tile.  In comes repair guy 1 then second opinion guy. Remedy; You gotta take that toilet out, bust out all that floor tile, cut out the sub floor, put in new sub floor, put in new tile, new toilet flange, and re set toilet then grout everything. Estimate to ""Do It Right"" nearly two grand. Since you have a carpenter, then a tile guy, then a plumber guy. My heart sank as I knew how much cash I had at the time.  My thoughts. The floor seemed good everywhere but around the flange. The toilet while it would turn and lift on one side was still holding fair on one side. If only I could just shoer this thing up where it would be stable. I wish I could just shoot something in there that would fix everything and not go in debt.  How about Gorilla Glue. No that would just make a bigger mess. No here me out this might work. No it won't Gorilla Glue expands and will screw up everything. All this was the conversation i was having with myself in my head.  Ok lets do this but how to get it under the toilet. I took the bottle of glue and went to the hose department at home depot and found some clear plastic hose that would fit on the end.  The process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.  The attack. Hose on bottle, one side of toilet is lifted, hose inserted, squeezing and not much is happening as this glue is thick. Plan B, set glue bottle on floor use foot pressure. Eureka we have glue flow. Pumped about two ounces all around the toilet. Luckily the high pressure from my foot did not make the hose come off and get all over my shoes and the outside of the toilet.  Ok ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.  All in all it worked. Solid as a rock. No leaks. Used some white silicone caulk around the base. The choice was either eight bucks for the glue, or nearly two grand that could better be used for other things like beer, new flat screen tv, taking the wife out to dinner sixty times, or other electronic man toys.  This glue saved me. In life you come across small things that work their way your heart for how well they help you or serve a purpose. Your uses and millage of course may vary.

And, I was planning to buy one. I did a lot of reading, because I tend to hang onto a vacuum cleaner for many years, even if I'm not very happy with it, and the Panasonic Jetforce came out at or near the top of every category. One problem of doing the research is that each manufacturer makes claims that cannot necessarily be compared to the claims of another, but are specific to a particular design.  In any case, the myth of Dyson superiority was dashed when I got a Dyson ""Air Multiplier"" fan/heater. It's nice, but I like my other, much-cheaper Honeywell fan much better. It's quieter and stronger. But I digress.  This Panasonic vacuum is very straightforward and free of gimmicks (unlike the Dysons).  It is super-light and rolls easily around behind me as I clean house. Now, there's no such thing as a quiet vacuum cleaner, regardless of claims. However, some are quieter than others, and this one is definitely the quietest vacuum I've every used. There are a few features I can't discuss honestly; I don't have pets and my floors are all hardwood and tile (no carpets). Hence the canister vacuum instead of an upright. In some ways, smooth floors seem harder to vacuum than carpets, since dust and debris move around will cleaning.  This machine does an excellent job of picking up just about any sort of dirt on the floors, including small bits of rock that get tracked into the house. I especially like the HEPA filter (no sign of one in the Dyson literature). With my old canister vacuum, I was generally sneezing by the end of cleaning the house; not with this one. The air isn't blowing through a bag full of months-old dust and dirt and Lord know what else, so there isn't the smell and residual blow-back of fine dust that I've always noticed with ordinary vacuums.  Another feature I like about this vacuum is the soft, rotating brush. The webpage touts its ""buffing"" action, but I also like the way the bristles move between the joints in the flooring and help to get small particles out from between the boards.  It's been a long time since I got a new vacuum cleaner, so I really appreciate the advances in technology. Looking at bagless vacuums in a few stores, many of them feel cheaply made, but this machine has the feel and look of quality and durability. In reality, if it does the job and does it well, that's pretty much all we can ask for. Maybe it doesn't make much difference in the long run whether you get a Dyson, a Hoover, or whatever bagless brand you find, but having tried this Panasonic, I can recommend it.",What I was looking for in a vacuum cleaner,1441929600,2.0,,know nice vacuum dust house move blow air read multiplier advance much durability particle maybe i've find rock onto digress floor small way upright panasonic smooth like come feature automatically jetforce floor however board recall recommend way dirt hardwood generally smell near someone fine regardless think others action reality job straightforward hoover can't brush soft get tout super-light category many strong thing i'd honeywell residual claim invent definitely problem harder ordinary quieter roll feel clean technology cheaply tile manufacturer well happy long store hang unlike bagless brand really that's literature bag one carpet lot track new quality pet whatever make place hence compare buffing free sign blow-back necessarily much-cheaper debris use discus dash machine first design sneeze whether cannot hepa full honestly help time sort get fan/heater would especially particular top rotating quiet buy also fan filter even clean bristle clean easily else pick year joint vacuum tend make case dyson appreciate i'm dysons quiet around since webpage pretty superiority old instead try gimmick mention excellent include look specific canister behind seem run end make there's people ask well lord research bit always another myth months-old difference notice every look planning feature

The type of job you would want to use these with are those that might burn up a lot of paper towels (each of these costs about the same as 20 standard paper towels if you assume 2 cents per sheet for regular towels) or require something sturdy, but disposable. Certain types of jobs, especially those which handle jobs that would destroy a rag or make it impossible to re-wash and sanitize, would benefit from this type of cloth. These would also be good for situations in which sanitation is an issue and you don't want to keep using rolls of paper towels throughout the day. These cloths are appropriate for things like greasy food clean-up or an exterior cleaning job (like patio furniture) in which you would need to use many towels. I found that you can rinse these out and wring them out. I used them to clean some pretty dirty outside surfaces and could rinse them in a bucket of water repeatedly and they did not fall apart.  I think that this is the sort of product that you will only want to buy if you engage in very specific activities.

The 2 probes are very nice and calibrated cleanly and quickly. But, it has 3 issues that need to be addressed in future versions:  1) It is a bit too noise for small signals - A few millivolts of continuous digital noise was displayed that never went away - even with the scope probes grounded. It was an annoyance more than anything, but if you really need to see if you have noise at that level along with a specific signal in a circuit, you can't really trust it to show you very low level signals in addition to another signal (e.g., noise riding piggyback on another signal), but that is the exception rather than the rule for most measurements. It DOES work for most basic measurements within the specified bandwidth. There was less than 3 db drop in a 22 Mhz signal and it triggered to display signals as high as 25 or 26 MHz sine, square and trianglular waveforms.  2) TO SAIN SMART: I had to work a while to find the software that would install correctly. I tried and old XP laptop I had that I wanted to dedicate to it, but I ended up using an old Dell Core-2 Duo Laptop with Win7 Pro. The software REALLY needs to be open sourced - I don't think you realize that 20 to 30 excellent programmers would take your software to a WHOLE NEW LEVEL in no time at all, and I would be willing to bet it would sell 10 times the number of units it does now with Open Sourced software. It appears to be using some type of framework for the development and that would probably be turned into a C++ or C# project in a real hurry with more features than the IRS has rules and Regs. THINK ABOUT IT!  Just publish the control information (control commands and data to read for the display for the USB interface) and you stand back and watch it take off like bottle rocket!  You won't be able to keep them in stock. Also, if the noise is from the A/D convertor, there should be a pretty cheap fix to smooth out that noise. If I get some time, I'll poke around and try to fix it and send you the modification information for it.  3) Triggering is a little on the mysterious side - I did find out that one of the adjustments is a Trigger Window setting and you have to experiment to get trigger signals to work that were not high level, repeating signals. All in all, it may get you by for the cost - if you can get the software working it is worth the cost - just barely, but it has GREAT PROMISE (if you OPEN SOURCE all of the COMMANDS to the USB interface - JUST DO IT - you will NOT be sorry! )",It may get you by for the cost vs.features,1495843200,2.0,,specify send nice away interface pro db command millivolt i'll find mysterious work realize usable fix probe smooth like sain appear project smart level sorry annoyance development sine need e.g try think rule open poke cost convertor time rule turn can't software get high address within barely bandwidth take cleanly addition great sell continuous want real hurry trigger unit go correctly a/d less source read trigger little regs really task repeat calibrate one square irs scope new future feature back usb whole low able exception set type quickly signal probably worth end waveform version bite digital trust signal number cheap display measurement time watch mind bet ground trigger would information xp issue also promise bottle experiment rocket laptop even see programmer drop install modification mhz trianglular willing side adjustment piggyback never need window circuit stock around duo framework pretty publish work old along try dell excellent specific rid noise basic display use source show another control data may anything keep small rather dedicate stand

I need bags that seal tight, are durable enough to withstand packaging, shipping, and daily use by my buyer, and appear to be high quality (are not blurry when you peer through them). I've ordered this set of 1000 bags three times over the last two months and I am sure I will order them hundreds of more times in my lifetime. I am beyond happy with these.  Each bag measures true to size at 4 inches by 6 inches. They are relatively thick in terms of the plastic, which makes them very durable. They hold my beads, small jewelry items, and little craft supplies perfectly. I also use them to organize my own construction hardware (screws, washers, etc) and they old up perfectly fine for that as well. Although they are thick and tough, they are very clear to look through. They don't have that 'hazy opaque' texture that other plastic bags have. You can very easily see what is inside of these bags.  These bags zip tight and stay shut. They are extremely easy to 'zip' and snap into place without any issue. I package my own products, so I want to be able to zip my bags shut very quickly so I can work efficiently. I never have to waste time aligning these bags to where they will zip. They always snap together and STAY shut without any issue. They take quite a rough shipment process and I have yet to hear complaints that one broke open in transit.  You receive 1000 bags in this order. Each set of 100 bags is separated into it's own plastic container. And all 1000 bags are packaged neatly in a cardboard box.

For a DIY'er with a house, workshop, vehicles, tractors and mowers, the uses are endless.  I keep a supply of both the industrial size as well as the smaller size on hand.  However, there is one BIG secret:  PREPARATION!  If the joining surface of the material to be fused is not prepared correctly, it will NOT work.  First, the surfaces must be roughed up a bit. On steel, iron, aluminum or any metal, I use a course grinding wheel if possible.  A file works fine if you have a supply of elbow grease.  My favorite method on small surfaces is using a tungsten carbide cutter bit with a Dremel.  Second, clean the surface thoroughly with acetone.  Do not use alcohol.  Acetone evaporates in a very few seconds.  Once the surface is dry, apply J-B Weld and allow it to cure. Repairing cracks is a breeze.  If I have a broken item in two parts, I rig some sort of jig to keep pressure on the joint while it cures.  With J-B Weld, Liquid Nails, Acetone and fiberglass cloth, there are not too many things that can't be repaired.  I had a concrete fountain bowl that weighed over 200 pounds in the front yard.  Weather extremes and age caused it to break in half on the pedestal.  My failure to keep the drainage holes clean in winter might have had something to do with it.  I cleaned it up, propped up one half on its side, covered both halves thoroughly and liberally J-B Weld and placed the halves together.  I allowed them to sit there and cure for a week.  I then covered both sides with a thick layer of exterior construction Liquid Nails and allowed it to dry another week before placing the heavy bowl back on the pedestal. That was over a year ago.  The repaired joint will last longer than the original concrete.  If you are so inclined, you can mix up a thin mixture of J-B Weld with acetone so it will completely saturate a piece of fiberglass cloth and repair a 6-foot crowbar.  Repairs are only limited by one's imagination.",J-B WELD HELD WELL,1305504000,93.0,,second extreme age mixture evaporate house fiberglass thoroughly hand i've use fountain work break repair nail longer cloth however dry cure surface supply week half fine might completely yard elbow last can't prepare favorite many allow secret grease big cause something joint cover tractor surface steel join must iron clean weighed pound correctly size fuse place exterior weld thick thing course one drainage acetone prop back file original industrial possible tungsten saturate crowbar repair material limit allow repair side crack together half first bit thin sort imagination cure metal method diy'er part pedestal item dremel winter rig ago pressure vehicle rough jig small work aluminum grind front liquid mix year sit second concrete side one's clean repair broken construction carbide piece incline wheel failure mower two endless workshop layer hole cutter breeze weather liberally bowl alcohol heavy use well year j-b another apply place preparation use keep small

Each regulator produced the regulated output of 5.01 DC to 5.03 DC across the entire voltage input range.

2532,62192,5,True,"04 25, 2017",A1YIFPM15ZHNIV,B012BNXIH0,,Michael Logusz,"Nicely suprised with the quality. I have worked in publishing art departments and libraries many whole life: every job came with edged tools and cutters and forceps, etc. I also have built 3 wristwatches so I'm used to using strange tools. I have some older forceps that i like and wanted more for my current needs: creating samples for microscopy, handling and standing up radioactive test sources for gamma ray spectroscopy and to augment my fiddling with watches and anything else i manage to disassemble.  These tools have a matte brushed look instead of the bright (cheap) chrome plate that dollar store tools have.  There are two scalpel handles with sealed blades: go watch YouTube video on how to properly install those. There is also a one piece scalpel which i thought ""oh, it's the only thing that's a little rough looking but I can grind a new edge on it"". Well, I didn't need to: it's obviously much sharper than any of my xacto blades: and I've got about 30 xacto handles and hundreds of different shape/style blades. A relative who is an MD gave me sealed surgical blades that were sharper than the one piece in this kit, however I'm going to guess that the sealed blades for the holder handles in this kit are sharper still! For hobby, artwork, etc these are sharp enough to get the job done. The one piece doesn't cut paper well: but it glides through plastic like a dream if you ride the rounded edge. I'm not dissecting anything but I'll assume this will go through skin and viscera just fine.  The big scissors cutting edges bow away from eachother (so they don't crush tissue? ) but they cut the padded envelope cleanly and very straight! No curve to the cut in paper.  The forceps click lock, but you can sort of pull sideways and open and close without clicking, and then release to lock. Dollar store hemostats make you click closed but open easy. These are easy both ways without being sloppy. Some wristwatch parts are thinner than a human hair so sloppy would be bad.  For modeling (search Logusz U-2540) you can lock and hold items your painting or gluing easily.  The blade holder handles are size 3 and 4. They are what i bought this kit for and the other stuff is icing on the cake.  The probes are nice. The tweezers are fascinating: the ends are bent 90 degrees and interlock like teeth: one triangular spike fitting into a triangular cutout on the bottom. Then there is a medium, blunt tweezer and a pointed pair.  The tongue lifting ""thingy"" with the keyhole notch I'm using to seperate out wiring in lower voltage electronic projects to trace back wires and hold while cutting.  Even the magnifier glass is useable! It's heavy glass, crudely ground at the edges but has no noticeable spherical abberation (no weird fisheye effect). You can see and draw what you see exactly without having to compensate for optical distortions.  A magnet will stick to these instruments, so you can infer what you will about metal composition. Nothing is marked as far as alloy or country of origin.  The twelve blades are gamma ray sterilized TS 4171 / BS 2982 that are ISO 7740. Carbon steel.

I do a lot of my own building and am making a lot of repairs to my current house and a log cabin I have. When I did a lot of roofing & siding work I assumed water would flow down and away so thats how I built everything. Along comes winter and the dreaded ice dams and now water flows uphill and under everything to then leak into the living spaces. I pulled some vinyl siding off to put on an addition and after only a few years enough water had gotten behind the siding and even the house wrap that it rotted away some large sections of OSB. I found the source of leaks to be where water ran down the sides of some window J-channels and where a sloped roof met an outside wall. I pulled off everything, made the repairs and then put all the trim back with healthy does of this sealant and the leaks are now gone and ice cant push up under it. I also use the clear around my wood stove pipes & roof flashing and it seals them tight so no water running down the pipe onto the stove when strong winds are pushing heavy rains. Im putting flashing over all the exposed wood fascia and this stuff ensures no water gets under it. if you vinyl siding you are likely getting water damage near the windows so don't assume that because you don't see it its not happening.

2578,46793,5,True,"03 19, 2014",A1KC3BVQ70CAMW,B00FJ5KXH6,,Notarat,"Ive been itching to get into 3D printing for some time now but had never taken the plunge previously due to the high cost and high maintenance required to keep a 3D printer in spec.  That said, my purchase of the Makerbot Replicator 2 was an impulse buy. I just got a wild hair up mabutt and clicked the Add to Cart, then removed it, then added it back several times during the day. Once Amazons site displayed the message, Order in the next 6 seconds and get it by Friday 14 March 2014, I went ahead and purchased it because at that point, it was less a desire for a 3D Printer and more of a battle to see if I could add it to my cart and check out in 6 seconds. (I succeeded, BTW. Curse you Jeff Bezos for making it so easy!)  Fast forward to Friday the 14th of March when it arrived.  Unboxing:  The unit arrived in a well-packed cardboard box. The first thing one sees when opening the box is the Owners manual. It sits in a recessed cut-out in a large cardboard piece that sits on top of everything else in the box. Removing that cardboard layer exposes the 3D Printer itself. There was plenty of protection for the unit, and its internal parts (the rods and belts and gears) were secured via plastic, snap-on bars and several large, thick zip ties.  Assembly & Setup:  Since the first thing you see when opening the box is the owners manual I got the distinct impression the manufacturer wanted me to actually read it prior to assembly and setup. How dare they insult my geekiness! (I did follow the instructions because breaking a $2500 printer trumps gaining a few geek points) Assembly of the unit was painless and straightforward. The manual covered just about every step of the process with the only exception being when to connect the USB cable from the printer to the computer. (This is, btw, just an optionyou do not need to ever connect it to a computer)  Note on PLA vs. ABS Plastic  PLA plastic is a biodegradable plastic filament made from corn or some crap like that. Printing with PLA plastic is a bit easier than ABS since its melt behavior is a bit more predictable, or so I gather from reading on various sites. It is also stronger than ABS Plastic but there is a drawback... its more brittle than ABS Plastic. When ABS parts are repeatedly ""bent"", they flex back and forth until they eventually fail. PLA Plastic will snap rather than bend and eventually fail. Ive heard it said by people with more sensitive noses than mine that PLA Plastic, when printing, smells faintly like pancakes. ABS plastic smells like, well, nasty, old burning plastic. We all know that smell so if Im going to spend 5+hours printing out some complex part Id rather smell flapjacks than some toxic, puke-inducing ABS smell any day  Initial Power Up:  Powering on the unit for the first time runs what I call the First Run Start-Up Script. It walks you through the process of leveling the build plate (where the printed items sit) and feeding in the filament to the extruder head, and printing a test piece.  Leveling the Build Plate:  Leveling the build plate is the single most important part of owning a 3D Printer. If you screw this part up, you're going to have a bad day, mmkay? Go back and read the previous sentence again. Twice. Leveling the build plate ensures the extruder head prints the PLA Plastic in just the right amount. If the build plate is too close to the extruder, the PLA plastic cannot be extruded. If its too far away, the printed plastic is too stringy and does not adhere to the layer underneath. There is also another reason it is so important to level the build plate. The build plate is created from Acrylic. Even though it is relatively thick it can, and will, warp over time from being heated in one area while remaining cold in others. Some may see this cost saving step as a detriment, but I do not. Its simply the laws of economics. Some corners had to be cut to keep the cost affordable. This was one of those cut corners. There are glass build plates available for ~$99-$109 depending on where you buy it and I do recommend purchasing one if you're going to put the printer through heavy use cycles. I also recommend using the mfg.-supplied blue painters tape on the build plate. It makes removing parts easier and protects the surface of the build plate. I also recommend purchasing about 20 of these strips (less than $30 at the mfg.s site)  Printing your first piece:  Printing one of the designs from the included SD card the printer ships with is probably the best way to see if the printer is properly setup and operational. I recommend the forever bracelet and the nut & bolt. Both put the printer through its paces and provide you with an idea what they are capable of doing.  Mfg-supplied Software:  The software is not included. You must go to the mfg site and download the software. It is basic print-only software. It does not allow you to create or edit files. You can print it or save it in a different format.  3D CAD Software:  There are many different kinds of free 3D CAD software out there so I will not cover all of them. I haven't touched a CAD program since 1990 so I am approaching this as someone who is brand new to CAD and just wants to get started making things, rather than getting an engineering  degree before I even power the printer up. I will cover only the ones I tried, and I my rating of them is, at best, subjective and based on my personal learning curveYMMV, obviously, depending on your experiences with CAD software.  1  Blender (Freeware) Pro: Very powerful! Tons and tons of options and capabilities! Con: Overly complicated for the Novice user, in my opinion. To me, it was a PITA compared to the other CAD programs, TBH. I could print everything I ever wanted to print using the other programs below before I could master this software enough to design & print 1 item.  2  123Make/Design (Free online version. Design stuff right in your browser!) Pro: Surprisingly easy to get started with and create stuff quickly. Con: It sometimes doesnt want to let you download what you created. Its not so much a case where it wants you to upgrade to the premium accountthe wwb site just has some ""eccentric"" idiosyncrasies you must deal with, though they are tolerable enough that I often use this program.  3 -- TinkerCAD(Free online version. Design stuff right in your browser!) Pro: Also surprisingly easy to use and also able to quickly get stuff created. Con: Not quite as powerful as the 123 software, though it is close enough that I use it as much as the 123 software. I use this about 50% of the time and the 123 software the other 50%. Often times, I'll create in this program, then ""tweak"" the design in 123 since it allows a little more fine-grain control.  CAD Software Summary:  In case you haven't guessed by now, I use #s 2 & 3 most often. When Im done with what Im designing, I save/download the file as a .stl file and import that into the Makerbot print software. I could also copy the .stl file to the SD card and put it into the SD Card reader on the printer and print out the part without using the computer at all. (In case I want to get some gaming in while watching my print)  Failed Prints:  I have had 2 prints fail. In each case, however, the failure was my design, not a defect in the printer.  Failure 1  In the first instance, I started printing a part and realized that, because of my poor design, there would be an un-supported section that would most likely fail, so I stopped the print. (Think of printing a wall with a doorwayif you printed it lying down, as a flat surface, itd look like a flat square with a missing section, where the doorway is located. If you print it oriented vertically, the arch of the doorway is not supported and the plastic would dip down and ruin the print, so I stopped the print process about 1 minute into the print so I could design in support for the archway of the door)  Failure 2  In the second failure, it was due to my forgetfulness. I have an Ultra USB 3.0 USB to SATA Adapter so I created a USB 3.0 Docking Station to put it in so I can hot swap my spare SSDs. In the design phase, I realized it needed an internal width of 1mm larger than I initially drew it... When I went back into the program to widen it, I got sidetracked with adding some bells and whistles to the design and completely forgot to widen it, lol.  Sources of 3D Objects:  Thingiverse is a major repository of 3D Designs you can access and download to print or modify. There are thousands and thousands of designs available and you may find what you want to print has already been created, thereby saving you much time and effort. Additionally, there are many conversion programs available that convert one file type into another so even if the item you want is in a different format, you may be able to export or convert it to a language the Replicator 2 can print  My impressions after having used it for four days:  Im happy with the purchase thus far. And, Im also cognizant of the fact these printers require maintenance and replacement parts on a fairly regular basiswhich increases their cost of ownership. Its something you should keep in mind as well unless you have $2500 to just throw away.  Im having a lot of fun designing and making things, and Im learning CAD skills as I go along. The more stuff I make, the more I think, Gee, I want to make one of those XXXX too!!!.  I started with only the goal of printing some fan grills, case parts, and air ducts for my computer.

My wife, however, is a true believer and assisted in reviewing this item.  It does seem to provide a good cleaning. The handle is reasonably comfortable. The brushed metal design looks modern. The brush heads go on and come off easily. The induction charger works well and battery life is good. It comes with 2 brush heads (one of which seems to be a child size).  The quadrant brushing timer (lets you know when to move from top right, to top left, etc) is a nice feature. The pressure sensor didn't seem necessary, but maybe some people need this feature. The ""clean vs. white vs. deep clean"" setting seems to me to be a confusing gimmick. I can tell what the intensity (low, medium and high) settings do, but nowhere could I find how the 3 cleaning modes are actually different. They feel different, but I couldn't tell what was different. They seemed to just be another way to vary the intensity of the vibration.  One other issue is the buttons on the handle. Although they have to be sealed for the device not to short out, there is a gap around each button into which gets toothpaste and water. This makes cleaning the handle unnecessarily annoying.

It looks pretty nice when printed well. Good matte finish.  But the layer adhesion is horrible.  I was hoping that being a variant of ABS it would be usable for functional parts and not just to look pretty.  Unfortunately I had to throw away most of the parts I made for the intended project because they would break very easily.  I know layer adhesion can be a factor of temperature, cooling rate, and environment temp.  I have an enclosed print area.  I have a heated bed.  And I tried temps ranging from 10 degrees under the recommended spec to 10 degrees over.  It actually performed best on the low end, which was surprising. I used it right out of the vacuum sealed packaging that had a bunch of desiccant in it.  My theory is that whatever they blended the ABS with is decomposing in the melt process.  At the higher temps it just peels apart layer by layer.  At lower temps it's a little harder to get it to separate, but not hard enough.  All of the PLA I've ever used has been more functional than this.  Most of the ABS has also been better. (though I have tried some real junk that was not worth the incredible hassle it caused)  So far, the Hatchbox ABS and a local company called Coex have given me the best results with ABS.  The Coex natural ABS plus is incredibly strong.  But I don't know if the black is.  Often the Black has a lot of carbon or other additive to get the color.  That can degrade strength a lot.  Might be the case with this one too.  If you want something black that prints well for looks, this might do ok.  Just use lower temps like 220c.  If you want structural strength, look elsewhere.",Horrible layer adhesion at all temps right out of the box.,1499558400,,,know local look nice away hard black horrible i've use theory packaging usable break natural like ever result seal project factor actually might variant structural elsewhere area apart consistent environment perform get enough spec seem recommend roll harder cause something great color melt real desiccant well surprising unfortunately print additive peel ok little finish rate one lot blend enclose whatever junk make degree right separate far low matte adhesion company good use worth temp print higher pla want coex intend degrade would heat part bed also strength temperature functional easily decompose vacuum incredible abs cool hop hassle plus hatchbox case process filament best incredibly often range layer carbon try look though call bunch end print well throw strong low give temp pretty

The fine print on the hose warranty usually says that the hose is guaranteed but not the fittings.  Once the fittings break or if I'm splicing two hoses together, I'll use this pvc cement to help secure the connector and/or the replacement male or female bib.  Most replacement hose bibs don't fit the hoses perfectly, so I run some of the Weld-On around the part of the bib to be inserted into the hose and also around the underside of the bib that rests against the end of the hose. This helps fill in any gaps and provides a more secure attachment.  The blue color is great because you can see if you've properly coated all of the surfaces and the Weld-On can be applied even if the hose end is still wet.  Quick drying is also a benefit although you should leave it to cure for 24 hours before using the hose.  The lack of strong odor is also a plus but you still should work with it in a well ventilated area and use a face mask.

Extremely strong floor brush and suction - does an excellent job beating the dust out of carpet and sucking it all up. 3.  Excellent air filtration.  It really does trap all the dust and pollen.  I'm allergic, and can really tell the difference. 4.  The different attachments all have a place on the vacuum and are held on well.  There is a wand attachment, a handheld rolling brush and a rubberized plastic attachment for scraping fur off of furniture. 5.  Automatic retracting power cable works very well, step on a lever to activate and the cord retracts quickly. 6.  Very easy to setup and put together for the first time - just need a phillips screwdriver. 7.  Reusable, easy rinse filter. 8.  Easy to dump the dust.  Pop off the canister, hold it over a trash bag, push button to drop the bottom off - it's hinged.  Shake out the dust, when done, just click the trapdoor back into place and return canister to the vacuum.  Cons: 1.  On the heavy side. 2.  Loud and sometimes squeaks down in the floor roller brush area.  Not sure where the strange noise is coming from exactly - it's not consistent but it's very annoying. 3.  Hose is ridiculously short.  Makes it so I have to wrestle the vacuum while using the hose.  Since the vacuum is heavy and the wheels only allow certain movements - it becomes a real wrestling match.  I hate this.  Especially when it could so easily be solved by just having a longer hose. 4.  There are little nooks and crannies in the brush area that fine dust accumulates in.  In the middle of vacuuming, I shut off the vacuum and tilted it back so I could check the floor brush - a ton of fine dust fell out all over the place.  Of course, it was easy to vacuum it up - but that's not the point.  I stop often to check the brush for over accumulation of hairs, threads, etc...and I hate that it always just spews chunks of dust everywhere whenever I do this. 5.  No attachment for dusting.  Dusting is a normal part of vacuuming for me and I don't like that this vacuum lacks that option. 6.  Feels rough around the edges - figuratively speaking.  With the loudness, the amount of heat it emits, spewing dust everywhere if you tilt it over to check the floor brush - it's not what I would call a refined and elegant appliance.  It's more of a pit bull of the vacuum family. 7.  Gets quite hot during operation. 8.  Care must be used when depressing the lever to retract the cord.  It can actually retract so quickly the metal end of the power cable whips around as it comes and smacks me in the leg.  Oww!!  Conclusion - It definitely works well in a rough and tumble kind of way.  It's definitely rough around the edges and not a sophisticated machine, but it gets the job done well.  For more refinement, look to spend more money.  Personally, I prefer canister vacuums since they are a lot easier to maneuver around but they don't have the floor brush beating power that this one has.  Canister vacuums are better for dusting and hard floors.  Uprights are better for thick carpet since they have the weight to really beat that carpet up.",Extremely strong floor brush and suction,1411776000,4.0,,hold dust vacuum hard plastic power air filtration wrestling heat pop i've amount quite longer small button wheel way lack extremely retract like bull floor appliance automatic hinge prefer could need attachment fine actually emit hot fell job hold area normal brush phillips consistent attachment trapdoor solve pro ridiculously ton spews many furniture allow whenever con suck everywhere wand definitely sure thread feel different cable real must money stop good trap cord middle dust wrestle shut depress put floor little figuratively thick really reusable bag that's course tilt one rinse retract conclusion push refinement personally love cranny part lot upright beat tell back annoy activate setup place rough trash point option accumulation kind easier own loud strange operation quickly use roll together machine first pit step come beat certain weight time hate nook call especially refine would retract accumulates metal vacuum carpet spend sometimes check movement tumble scrap speak match dump tilt cleaner work filter squeak edge fur easy hose suction bottom easily drop vacuum click oww lever side screwdriver short smack allergic shake etc...and i'm hair since around becomes whip maneuver often elegant chunk come look excellent canister leg end handheld noise make footprint return pollen roller spew sophisticated heavy rubberize loudness well use always do strong difference exactly get family store care

That hard-case is unusually nice (compared to the plastic ones previous models have had), and tightly fitted to hold the brush handle and two brush heads.  Keeping that black handle looking nice does mean having to wipe down the brush after every use (the toothpaste stains that accumulate on the white 5000 are going to be much more visible here).  But you probably expected that if you bought a black-handled toothbrush?  I remain ambivalent about the wireless function with the 7000, as I did with my 5000.  Some people may appreciate the visual display of current setting and brushing time remaining, and having a clock in the bathroom is nice (my favorite part of the display).  But generally I just find it's clutter (another thing on the counter) and another wireless signal that may interfere with all my other wireless signals.  So the wireless display stays in the closet usually.  As for function, considering Oral-B's history, it goes without saying that this toothbrush does a good job getting my teeth clean.  They've been in the business long enough that the basic functionality just works.  If you haven't heard the spiel on why electric toothbrushes are so much better, it's worth researching, but the summary  would be: more cleaning motion, more consistently, your dentist will approve of the results.  I'd assume somebody looking at the top of the Oral-B lineup has previously used an electric toothbrush, but if not, expect to take some time to acclimate to the vibrations in your mouth (it'll feel funny / tingly / numbing), and your gums may bleed a little at first, the manual says (but that never happened to me).  It's worth the effort adjusting to the new way of brushing-- it ends up being less work on your part, much better results for your teeth, better polishing, and only a little extra minor cleanup.  I prefer the gentler heads (the blue ""sensitive"" ones).  The floss-action heads feel a little too aggressive on my teeth, and I floss normally anyway.  While I loved my old sonic toothbrushes, Oral-B seems to have moved completely to rotary-head brushes like the 7000 (although you may still be able to find their Pulsonic product), and I've grown accustomed to them. As with charging most such devices, the first time takes extra-long, and it's best to let that first charge finish completely, before use.  Observe Oral-B's recommendations on charge/discharge, but generally it's best to let the battery discharge most of the way before recharging.  The price of this 7000 is high, but likely the reason you're looking at this brush, instead of the 4000 or 5000, is that it looks cool.  There's a luxury niche in every consumer industry, and there's no reason for Oral-B to not cater to people willing to spend a little extra for appearance. Since those of us on a tighter budget can still get the equally capable next models down, it doesn't hurt anybody that this one is more expensive.  So, I rate it 5-stars with the caveat that you should also consider the cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oral-B-Professional-5000/dp/B008PEMOV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oral-B Professional 5000</a>.

I charged the camera and pressed the power button indicated in the foldout. You have to hold it down for a second or two for the camera to power on.  The power button is flanked on each side by two directional buttons. The button on the side controls the flashlight. The LED flashlight has two intensities, high and low.  The light is very bright, especially on the high setting.  The thermal imager scans the area slowly and feeds the image back to the LCD screen. You can choose from a selection of seven filters. I personally find white to be my favorite due to the higher and more definable contrast. It is very effective at discerning thermal variations, even slight ones.

A few surprised me, particularly along the roof. It warrants further investigation and likely some reinforcement of the insulation.

I drilled a large enough pilot hole with a twist bit, and then started feeding the step bit in the hole. It cut smoothly and did not bind up at all. The hole it made was perfectly round and no burs left on the front side. It did leave burs on the backside of the metal, but I simply did a very light drill with this step bit on the back just enough to knock off the burs.

Commercial testing labs charge over a hundred dollars and take at least a week, sometimes several.  Our local health department also tests, but only for biological contamination, and the cost is about the same as this test kit, so I thought that I would give this a try.  There are several test strips included and a vial for the biological test.  Some tests take a minute, some several minutes and the biological test takes 48 hours.  All were simple, and the directions very clear.  The only thing that I would add is that you need to take your sample from a faucet without a hose or aerator (or unscrew it) and wash the outer parts of the faucet and threads with a 50/50 bleach/water solution.  I have learned this with previous testing instructions that I have done. Let the water run for several minutes before gathering a sample and use only cold water.  Some of the test strips are compared to a color chart for results, while some are a yes/no indicator.  The results seem consistant with previous tests that I have done, and I was pleased with the results of the ones that I was wondering about.  This kit is worth the price for piece of mind alone.  Update on 4/13/2013:  I degraded from five stars to three.  I am still pleased with results of this test kit, however, after just purchasing my 4th in as many years, I am disappointed in two things:  - the price seems to have increased substantially - this particular kit was missing the test strip for iron, but had two test strips for copper.  Okay, so everything is increasing in cost, but the quality should remain consistent or get better.  Just how hard is it to add items to a box and snap it shut?

If you plan on sanding and acetone smoothing then the benefits of ABS shine. It won't be perfect off the printer, but you are sanding, smoothing, and painting it anyway. So, crank up the printer speed, print at the highest layer height, and spend a half hour post processing to reduce the print time in half.

I first tried to glue a plastic wheel barrow what has a 6 in split in it with this this product.  After TWO days of drying (and scraping a lot of foaming residue) I dumped a load of dirt and it immediately split on first load.  Okay, maybe not enough surface area to make a good bond.  I took a strip of flexible plastic and roughed up both original surfaces and the new reinforcement strip and surface that would be in contact with it with 80 grit sandpaper, AND I also CLAMPED the reinforcement strip firmly, but not tightly, in 3 locations.  Again, after 3 or 4 days (home owner, don't have to use wheel barrow every day luckily) of setting time I went to use wheelbarrow.  Put shovel in wheelbarrow and let handle drop to side.

So much for strong.  * It has become brittle on two or three projects for me, mostly ones exposed to intense sunlight or freezing temperatures. And then FAILED.

These are very thin but they are also quite strong in relation to how thin they are.  I've reviewed several other gloves and these are on one end of the spectrum and the Heavy Duty gloves are on the other end.  The others are in the middle.  For most jobs, I would choose the middle thickness ones - but these ones are good for those delicate jobs where you just want hand protection but want maximum feel as well. 2.  Fit is true to size.  My hands are 7"" long and 3 3/4"" wide and they fit perfectly 3.  Deep Indigo colour like the box shows - in my video they look blue for some reason.  Definitely recommend these for delicate jobs.  For every day jobs, I would get the medium thickness gloves at least.  If there are any questions, please feel free to leave me comments below and I will do my best to answer them.

I did some mowing, but mainly I cleaned and polished floors. Over the years on a few occasions I have pranked a few people who clean floors by offering to operate their heavy duty industrial buffer. They agreed, expecting that it would pull me violently around, but it is like riding a bicycle: once you have mastered using an heavy duty buffer, you can do it for life. My point is that I did some pretty intense cleaning of large communal areas for several years. I would unquestionably have benefitted from having a custodial cart like this one by Rubbermaid. I have had a number of Rubbermaid products over the years and most of them are, well, made of rubber. Not this cart. This is heavy duty, made of rugged synthetic covers and strengthened by boards and metal framing. It is large and capacious and capable of holding all the cleaning supplies that you can come up with.  There are more storage areas than I can easily summarize in a review. It would be great if Rubbermaid had provided more photos showing the interior. Let me break it down into three general areas. Along the exterior side of the cart there are flaps or pockets or zipper storage compartment. Most of your most extensively used items can easily fit in these exterior flaps. Then there is a removeable tray on the inside, just underneath the large covering lid. It has six large spaces that can accommodate large containers or even two smaller items each. Now, I have only two complaints with the cart and one comes up here. It is a little tricky getting getting the large tray out of the cart, even if the tray is empty. Perhaps I'll improve with practice, but  as things stand it  is pretty tough getting it in and out. However, despite it being difficult to get the tray out of the cart, the tray's spaces are delightfully large. One of the items I've put in the tray is a 32 oz. spray bottle of Lysol Kitchen cleaner. It fits easily in one of the spaces, with plenty of headroom.  My other complaint about the cart concerns the floor of the bottom space of the cart. When you pull out the tray from inside the cart, you will find a very large storage area that can hold all of the items you use a little less often. The only problem - and here is my complaint - is that the floor of the bottom space consists only the fabric resting on the plastic legs that run the width of the cart. Smaller bottles, if not stored alongside other bottles that will prop one another up, will fall over. Once you get all your bottles in place things are OK, but it would have been better to have put a board on the bottom to provide better support.  Despite my two complaints, this is a great custodial cart. It really is extremely well designed and very practical custodial cart. It really is an immensely large cart, one that allows you to put all your cleaning supplies and cleaning tools in places where they are easily accessible. This is an ideal cart for a small business or someone who runs their own cleaning service. It is also great for the home, where you can assemble all the items that either you or someone you hire to do your cleaning. All in all, this is definitely a quality product, and if they tweak those couple of problems, it would be pretty close to perfect.",A pretty close to ideal heavy-duty custodial cart,1463529600,,,fall product duty container plastic custodial fabric i'll storage i've find use assemble break rubber extremely weekend like strengthened floor intense space board occasion however complaint space service ideal cover practice supply come someone bottle product perfect capacious six accommodate job area hold problem get perhaps high several cart photo agree support bicycle frame interior definitely problem benefit great run violently master consists clean good less exterior compartment ok put floor little flaps lysol prank thing polish really place one complaint despite tool business operate quality make show place underneath industrial hire janitor point extensively tray's pull unquestionably let hold communal spray synthetic home serve tweak large used couple fit immensely offer kitchen first item come number school rubbermaid empty would tray metal fit practical removeable concern church summarize general also accessible bottle close area lid small zipper even clean provide clean mainly easily inside plenty bottom year pocket oz difficult childhood improve provide side tricky clean headroom either design width rest around prop two often along life run store rid delightfully board allow expect people mow heavy tough alongside use well rugged get legs three another buffer cover capable small pretty review stand

So far, I have had no problems with mine.. They have held up pretty good.. The only thing I have seen is I double check to make sure that the outside locking ring locks fully into place when Ii connect things together. That is about it.  Original Review:  I bought this to go with my pressure washer gun that I just got. I bought a new gun, and after not looking really close, I realized after I got it in that it had a 3/8"" quick connect fitting on it.. So, this is where this came in. It fits the connector perfectly.. So what I did, was put one part of this on my old gun that still worked, and the other end on my pressure washer hose. The hose that I have, is a standard one for a standard system, and the ends are threaded. I have a 2300psi gas powered pressure washer. It uses standard fittings for these types.. which are the M22 metric threads..  I tried the female end, on both, the male end that came with this setup, and the one that came on my new gun. They both fit perfectly, with no leaks or anything else..  The quality of the fittings seems very nice. They definitely did not skimp on quality, or machining, at least on the ones I got. They fit together perfectly and easily too.  Overall, I have no complaints about these.. I wish I could say the same about the gun that I bought. In any case, I found nothing wrong, so it gets 5 stars. I did not take any pictures, or measure anything, or do things like that with this, because, to be honest, people care about, does it work, and is it of good quality, with something like this.. And the answer is yes.. so I did not go into minor details about it.","Nice 3/8"" connector with m22 threads that fit standard preassure washer hoses perfectly.",1468972800,,,hold nice measure female connect quite work double type like come could one time realize problem least skimp nothing leaks thing seem take gun definitely sure something thread mine connector find ring put star minor see thing really metric one complaint part new quality original setup place answer wrong far ii picture yes good lock quick use perfectly worked couple outside together fit male lock update fully month get fit check standard close pressure still end honest wish hose easily else gas buy make care case overall old try powered system end people detail go fit washer say get anything look us fitting thread machine pretty review

Most of us have been in a home repair situation that just keeps getting worse the more you get into it. When that happens worse means more cash to fix the problem. There are those who say just ""do it right"" or don't do it at all. You know who you are. I can agree with them, when there is money to use, but when there are no funds there is..... Gorilla Glue. Well here is my story.  I had a small problem that quickly spiraled into a carpenters truck payments. I had a loose toilet. Not a big deal right. Tried to usual tighter down the loose bolts. No help they just kept turning, which means the terrible and dreaded WOOOOOD ROTTTTTT. Yes Houston we have a problem. The tiolet flange that holds it in place was rotten from some sneaky water leak somewhere not visible. This insidious leak had taken its toll and caused great damage under the bathroom tile.  In comes repair guy 1 then second opinion guy. Remedy; You gotta take that toilet out, bust out all that floor tile, cut out the sub floor, put in new sub floor, put in new tile, new toilet flange, and re set toilet then grout everything. Estimate to ""Do It Right"" nearly two grand. Since you have a carpenter, then a tile guy, then a plumber guy. My heart sank as I knew how much cash I had at the time.  My thoughts. The floor seemed good everywhere but around the flange. The toilet while it would turn and lift on one side was still holding fair on one side. If only I could just shoer this thing up where it would be stable. I wish I could just shoot something in there that would fix everything and not go in debt.  How about Gorilla Glue. No that would just make a bigger mess. No here me out this might work. No it won't Gorilla Glue expands and will screw up everything. All this was the conversation i was having with myself in my head.  Ok lets do this but how to get it under the toilet. I took the bottle of glue and went to the hose department at home depot and found some clear plastic hose that would fit on the end.  The process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.  The attack. Hose on bottle, one side of toilet is lifted, hose inserted, squeezing and not much is happening as this glue is thick. Plan B, set glue bottle on floor use foot pressure. Eureka we have glue flow. Pumped about two ounces all around the toilet. Luckily the high pressure from my foot did not make the hose come off and get all over my shoes and the outside of the toilet.  Ok ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.  All in all it worked. Solid as a rock. No leaks. Used some white silicone caulk around the base. The choice was either eight bucks for the glue, or nearly two grand that could better be used for other things like beer, new flat screen tv, taking the wife out to dinner sixty times, or other electronic man toys.

Along the way, I have amassed quite a collection of parts, including resistors.  The problem is that when you need something, it takes too much time to find it.  And then, the silver leads are often tarnished requiring cleaning before they can be soldered to.  In the end, you may have to go to Radio Shack anyway.  Recently, I've gotten more interested in pursuing my hobby again.  When I found this resistor assortment, I decided that it was a good value and would save me a lot of time.  The resistors are all sorted by value into separate envelopes and are ""1%"" er's.  In the ""old"" days, I mostly used ""10%"" resistors because they were readily available and cheaper.  The extra accuracy could be more important for analog applications.  Since almost everything I do is digital, I could probably get by with just a few values and less accuracy.  However, there is nothing more frustrating than when I have to stop working on something, no matter what that is, and go hunt for something or go to the store or order.
