Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.  ""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.  You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.  I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.",Nothing like actual Muesli,1303948800,14.0,,,surprised dime local box product bob's pluses crazy much cold fruit quite fruit natural milk steam-cooked excited flake like toast love red i.e sell extra shower true steam prefer health-foods european-style usually product try think expensive one nut italy cereal grocery many name certainly lightly yogurt chain sell minute real brewing contain superior european flake well mill breakfast le unlike cereal dorset eat plunk minuses one despite flake turn make producer grain spray hair similar far muesli hotel hfcs single quaker couple fit amazon bit baked food ten learn fully eat would mostly mueslis imagine kellog's extend satisfied see time-to-mushiness press rolled mix concern per familia idea side willing owe plus large i'm minus saw overall chewy yet soak instead tried trip heavy sugar available mush u.s process give store coffee

Freeze dried Acai appears to be the most dependable formulation for delivery of the benefits of the berry, but I honestly noticed no change after a month trial.

I give the product three stars, because I do believe that for some people, they may see remarkable results, but I certainly did not. I still believe that this product is worth a try, for all the reasons that the Acai Berry has the potential to yield wonderful changes in overall health. It just did not do it for me. Good luck to those who choose to try this. I would recommend this brand because of the preference of the freeze dried state to hold onto all the nutritional ""miracles"". Don't get succored into cheaper brands. The nature of a complicated illness may or may not be a factor that determines clinical outcomes.

But when i add two table spoons of Bragg's vinegar, morning and evening, to about 4 oz of water and about 4 oz of Pomegranate juice the taste becomes delectable. It is almost like having a glass wine with a little sour touch. I love it. But here is the best part yet. When I was at the doctor's office just before I started drinking this delectable juice, the nurse insisted on weighing me, which I did not mind. But here is the point, within one week after I started drinking this delectable juice, I literally lost 3 pounds of weight without even trying, or intending to lose weight. Since I started drinking this juice, I lost a real desire to eat. Whenever my wife would suggest eating I would just tell her that I was not hungry. But today was different. I had declared a day of no juice, just because I wanted to be different, but by the end of the day i had eaten everything that was chewable, or drinkable. I immediately realized why I had lost the 3 pounds of weight in 1 week. It was confirmed to me that drinking this juice was definitely suppresssing  my appetite, with absolutely no intention of drinking this drink for this purpose. But I am drinking the Bragg's vinegar for health reasons for sure, like cholesterol and HBP etc,  and the loss of appetite is just a bonus. Furthermore, the seller is one of the best customer friendly on the web, and that is very important to me, and I imagine to you as well. Also, the bottles (I bought 3) that I purchased were so well packaged; that if you were to drop a bottle from a second story window it would not break. It is not often that you come across a purchase on the web that has so many positives, to sing its praises. On top of that I have not even mentioned a word about the price, which was the lowest for this product on the internet. So buy Bragg's vinegar, make your own juice just as you like it, drink it and be happy or be happier. But remember happiness does not come from what you drink or eat, but it comes from inside and this drink is just a compliment to your own happiness.  .",'s,1408406400,27.0,,,desire spoon second internet furthermore even happiness taste break customer nurse sing like immediately start add week come pomegranate bottle product health seller package vinegar glass eaten chewable realize important office hbp many whenever within declare drinkable reason definitely sure today great drinking different real insist want pound wife happy hungry low eat word little wine friendly loss suggest one compliment touch love part tell praise table morning drink point bonus try mention delectable weigh lose positive come price cholesterol weight almost across remember eat bragg's mind purchased purchase would confirm imagine top happier everything buy etc also bottle juice literally even water inside sour day drop oz purpose buy make window since best becomes two often yet story without intention intend end web well doctor's suppress lose odor appetite absolutely

I tried foil, but it can't seal tightly enough.  I've tried the one-cup inserts, but they are a real pain to rinse and use each time.  These lids fit almost all the K-cups perfectly.  There are some that don't work very well, but that is the cup, rather than the lid.  The filters inside the K-cup are glued just inside the rim of the cup.  If the filter isn't trimmed or properly aligned during original manufacture the lid is very difficult to get on.  It still works, but it is a pain.  Donutshop is one cup that is like that.  To re-use the K-cups, first, buy these lids.  Tear off the foil cap on the cup - it doesn't have to be perfect, just make sure there is no foil that can bend down into the cup itself.  Empty the used coffee - I recommmend putting it through your disposal unit, it actually helps keep the blades sharp and helps keep odors away.  Rinse the filter thoroughly - I use a tooth brush to gently pull the stuck grinds.  Just lay the tooth brush on the filter and turn the K-cup all the way around once and all the coffee will come out.  After they are rinsed, I recommend drying them, but it is not a required step.  Then, fill them up and pop this lid on top.  When you make a cup of coffee with a used K-cup, make sure to align the bottom hole with the bottom needle so you maintain pressure.  Two holes cause leaks and weak coffee.  The lids themselves can be reused as well, as long as you don't break off the tab that gets created when the top needle punctures it.  I've been through 100 lids once with no issues and about a dozen reused lids with no issues.  These things are a great solution.

Being preservative free with very little sodium (less than 100 mg per can), the flavor of the beans comes through and is excellent.

This causes them to stick in the can, and removing them requires one to force them out of the can with a spoon, knife, or fork.  The end result is that many of the beans get smashed, which doesn't work well if you want to boil or cook them, although it would save some time in making a vegan version of re-fried beans.  Note that you'll find brown specks in some varieties of Eden beans.  Do not be alarmed: the specks are kombu (kelp), an organic sea plant that's used as a natural preservative.

This is one pricey love but I've been fond of this, ""tastes like liquid oxygen"" beverage since it got to the United States in the 80s!  Then it was practically a salon item. I even called overseas to the French offices that controlled its distribution back then and was told, ""you don't see it everywhere because we don't want it sold everywhere!"".  I started drinking it when it was $1.99 for this 50 ounce size now its nice to see it below $3 a bottle.  Once you have it you can't stand anything else I'm afraid.  I dragged in bottles via city cabs.  Then once my fingers could stand the shopping bag handles no more, I bribed delivery people to go beyond their store's delivery area to begin to get a monthly case.  Fast fwd 20 years finally I have online grocers who yes yes yes carry Volvic so my living rm looks like a Volvic storage facility at all times.  Poland Spring tastes bitter by comparison and even Figi with its great bottle and all doesn't taste as clean and refreshing as Volvic does year in and year out.  I am so glad this luxury now involves giving clean well water to those in world who had no clean water (says so right on the bottle).  There is a website that discusses the mineral content of bottled water brands.  I'll admit Volvic is certainly not high in any natural mineral but then that's why I say it tastes literally like liquid nothingness.  It isn't laden with minerals which sway the taste of water even though they're healthy for us.  I'll just have to get my minerals some other way.  Leave my water crystal clear please.  Can't believe its finally available online minus the typical $56+ in shipping fees. haaalayleuyah.

So check your count when you get it.  Amazon needs to improve how they pack beverages.  That seems to be where if any you will get bashed or broken items.

A GARDEN OF FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR  This tea is so enchantingly fragranced, I feel I could put a few bags in my drawers as sachets! It's a strong scent with a correspondingly strong flavor. I have 1 tea bag steeped in 16 oz of water, twice the recommended 8 oz, and it's so perfectly flavored, I can't imagine what it would be like concentrated in just 8 ounces.  But don't get me wrong. I LOVE this flavor. It reminds me of something from childhood but I don't know what, and every sip I take makes me more comfortable and content. It's an unmistakeable floral flavor, with the slightest hint of something spicy in the smooth aftertaste. It's a great springtime flavor. I think it would be very fun for little girls' tea parties, with a nap to follow.  REST AND RELAX WITH ROSES & MORE  Ah yes, a nap. I love naps!  This tea is named ""Rest"" because it's a naturally caffeine-free herbal tea featuring, among other herbs, Valerian Root, a gentle sleep aid that's been used for centuries. I have to be careful not to drink *too* much of it in the daytime, though fortunately I already take a delicious afternoon nap almost every day, now preceeded by a cup of tea with a bit of reading. I have begun to notice a definite improvement in my overnight sleep and I fall asleep must quicker when I drink this tea at bedtime. I used to have a terrible time falling asleep at night due to arthritis pain and anxiety, even with prescriptions like Opana, Lunesta, and Clonazepam. But this tea!  What a pleasant way to take (doctor approved) herbal supplements - that work!  PAIN MANAGEMENT?! - THROUGH ""RES'TEA'iNG""  A good night's sleep and lots of rest are incredibly helpful for reducing arthritis pain. So this tea has turned out to be a great help for me as I suffer from severe Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, which I've had for 29 years, since I was age 3. In that time, it has done a number on all the joints in my body, and the damage severely limits mobility and cause serious tormenting pain. It's gotten very difficult to control in the last few years, so any little thing that improves my comfort level is enthusiastically embraced. (in fact, if you're reading this and have any suggestions, helpful tops or tricks for living with RA, please leave a comment!)  But i am getting off topic. You see, originally I didn't buy this tea for use as a sleep aid, or to help me with JRA. I bought this tea because I LOVE ROSES! And this tea delivers!!  A SIMPLE, REFRESHING WAY TO ENJOY YOUR TEA  I am at this moment drinking my tea cold, by an unusual and very easy method. I stick a Tazo bag in a bottle of water (by folding it in half) and let it steep, then shake up the bottle and drink. I leave the teabag inside because it won't easily come back out. No matter, because it makes for a fun, flavorful, cool drink to chill with. Possibly leading to a nap ;) Plus I always refill the bottle once to get the most out of the teabag (and the bottle!) Then, if I can, I pull the teabag out (by then indeed I often can) and can recycle the bottle. I have a nice little routine going strong!  I just now made sure to order the 6-pack offered by Amazon with Amazon Prime, so in a few days I'll have 6 boxes of Rest tea - 96 teabags! Enough for now . . . ;)","Beautiful flavor that comforts & quiets, even eases pain.

When I opened sleeve and poured the crystals into my mug I was surprised at the rich aroma.  Then, adding hot water and stirring, a light foam came to the top, sort of like an expresso.  I first tasted it without any additions.  The flavor seemed full but the kick I am use to in caffeinated coffee was not there.  After adding the cream and sugar, the flavor still was full and pleasant.  My feeling is this is a great, convenient product for traveling or backpacking. It is convenient because of the small package sizing that I received.  That size will fit beautifully in luggage or a purse.

When these k-pods arrived I couldn't wait to try them. The flavor is awesome.. perfect blend that is not too strong.  The features that attracted me: First, the cups are not made completely of plastic so this means they are better for the environment.  The bottom of the little cup is made similar to a strainer, allowing the water to just drip thru like my old coffee pot does, that makes no extra plastic needed and I think makes for a better taste.  It will fit my Keurig coffee maker (good for me).  The company uses Arabica coffee beans and has a breakfast blend which appeals to me.  It comes in a stay fresh type of pouch that makes for less packaging, again, better for the environment.  I can purchase it online and have it sent to my door.  No more measuring (yay)  These single serve k pods are Keurig 2.0 compatible and will brew in most k-cup compatible brewers such as Keurig, Cuisinart, Breville & Mr. Coffee k-cup single-serve brewers (Not compatible with Keurig Vue or Rivo).

Too many iced tea makers have yet to learn the lesson that any flavoring must be subtle and not overwhelm the tea itself. Subtlety seems to be hard to learn, and does not seem to be part of their game plan. They would rather hit us over the head with iced teas that more closely resemble various varieties of fruit punch.

The last batch of HiLine I received had been roasted quite recently, compared to many other brands which often roast their beans far in advance and ship out their capsules up to a year after the beans had been roasted.  The taste difference is distinctly noticeable.  This was one of the brands I served at a blind tasting (where all the attendees loved coffee, and one has worked at a notable third wave shop for several years) - and this was univerally agreed upon to be the best brand present (which included Nespresso.)  Although the barista was reluctant to admit that any espresso pre-encapsulated and pulled from a one touch machine could be a high quality product, even she admitted that HiLine was more than tasteable - but actively good.  I see some other reviews mentioning one out of three pods failing; in my Inissia, I haven't had one out of 120 pods fail.  My understanding is that HiLine's initial launch of Nespresso compatible pods was not so good and not so successful - maybe they received holdovers from those?

My family eats a LCHF (ketogenic) diet, so these are a rare sweet treat. While we can't have very many of these at one time because they're not exactly healthy, we've figured out a few ways to stretch them to get the most bang for our buck (and gram of sugar):  1) We make a small batch of low sugar ice cream or frozen custard and plop a dollop between two of these crisps...an amazingly tasty ketogenic ice cream sandwich! 2) We take two of these crisps to bookend a square of extra dark chocolate (75-80% cocoa) and some whipped cream cheese with a drop or two of stevia added for sweetness. Then, we hold them over the flame on our gas stove for a few seconds for ketogenic s'mores. Sooo good. 3) We use these crisps with all sorts of toppings: nut butters of all kinds, cream cheese, a few drops of honey, etc. Anything goes, and they taste fantastic.  If I have to nit-pick, I have two tiny complaints: - They're pretty pricey. We've checked online and brick-and-mortar...these babies will set you back $6-7 per bag at least. But, we don't eat them often, and when we do, we don't just pop them like potato chips, so everyone gets enough. - I get it, these are made by a tiny little start-up. So, not complaining. But I wish they were available at more retail and web outlets. We are stuck buying at Whole Paycheck for now, but I'm holding out hope that other stores in our area will be selling them soon. More online options would be great, too! Despite these two mini-gripes, we'll keep on buying these since our family is now addicted to them.

How could you possibly have a biscuit in a pouch to which you add water? Well, I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this meal was. The little squares of biscuit still had a bit of crunch to them, sort of like toasted bread cubes, except they tasted like biscuits. Not only that, but the bag is chock full of biscuits, so there is crunch in every spoonful.  1.  Plus - This tastes very good.  Though I was testing it in my kitchen, I poured the boiling water right into the pouch as I would if I were camping.  2.  Minus  As with most prepared foods, this has a lot of sodium, the most of the three Mountain House meals that I've tried to date. One cup of the prepared Biscuits and Gray has 900 mg of sodium. A whole bag, which is 2 cups, has a 1800 mg. Compare this to the Mountain House Chicken Fried Rice, which has 1500 mg of sodium in a 2  cup bag.  To quote the Mayo Clinic's website: ""The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 mg a day  or 1,500 mg if you're age 51 or older, or if you are black, or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.""  3.  Plus  Ease of preparation is excellent. Just pour boiling water into the pouch and stir. Seal the pouch (it has a zip-lock closure), wait 12-14 minutes, open and eat.  4.  Minus  - As with most emergency foods I'm testing, you need not only potable water but very hot potable water.  5.  Plus  If you're in an emergency and counting on your stored food, this seems like a good option. This has 310 calories per cup to give you energy. If you were counting on this for all your food in a stressful situation, it is has a little more fat than some other Mountain House foods, and zero of it is trans fat. It also has a little less protein. In one cup, 14 g fat, 36 g carbs, 8 g protein  6.  Plus  Long shelf life. The bag of Biscuits & Gravy I just purchased has a use-by date of November 2027.  Contains milk, soy and wheat.  My interest in Mountain House foods comes from the aspect of emergency preparedness, not camping. Articles I've read recommend that you have a minimum of 1-3 months water and food. A good choice for our emergency supplies because it is different from the usual.

I can smell the taste of aspartame and the foulness of sucralose from ten feet away. They're wretched and awful and terrible. I try to buy drinks sweetened with cane sugars instead of corn syrup. I've tried a few stevia drinks before (Zevia and others), but haven't been entirely happy with the flavor.  On a trip to Target, I randomly grabbed a bottle of this stuff off the shelf. It was an impulse buy. I was thirsty, and I had two kids screaming at me about Legos and Shopkins. My brain was about to explode. I saw ""naturally"" and ""antioxidants"" on the label, read no further and threw it onto the conveyor belt. $2 later, there was no turning back.  In the car, I almost had an aneurysm when I realized it was reduced calorie, because, as we all know, reduced calorie beverages taste like crap. I threw it in the bag with the rest of the things I didn't intend on buying from Target, and drove home with thirsty annoyance. I stuffed the bottle in the place where failed beverages go to wait until I'm super thirsty and all of the glasses are in the dishwasher. Two weeks later, that day came.  I reluctantly popped open the bottle, convinced I'd have a sip and then pour it out. I took a taste and was pleasantly surprised. I waited in anticipation for the aftertaste of doom that never came. And then it dawned on me - holy CRAP, this stuff is DELICIOUS.  It's got to be the erythritol in combination with the stevia that make this stuff taste a million times better than any drink I've ever had that's sweetened with stevia alone. It doesn't taste like a reduced calorie drink. It tastes like... sugar!  And this flavor, in particular (Tanzania Lemonade Tea) is just fantastic. I bought a variety pack from Sam's Club right after I had my taste-epiphany, and it didn't include this flavor. The others were fine (except the coconut! yuck... well, it's not bad with cranberry juice & vodka. Otherwise yuck!) but this is by far the best.  Bottom line? Even if you don't generally go for reduced calorie junk, try this. Both sweeteners are natural (yay! no aspartame) and there's no aftertaste.

Unfortunately for them, they only sold it in single cans, so Amazon got my money. Anyhow, I know my way around energy drinks, and one of the measurements I use is ""can it get me past two o'clock""? Most energy drinks fizzle out around noon (Arizona Health Tonic, here's looking at you); the ones that last are a little dangerous -- Monster Energy Mean Bean/Kona, NOS, and Full Throttle. Monster Energy leaves me with ""payback"" if I drink it two days in a row; NOS can make me twitchy; Full Throttle makes my irises twitch. The last one is downright scary and as a result, I don't drink it any longer (I suspect it is the combination of D-ribose and caffeine). Now, it should go without saying that the drink must not only work, but taste good! The original Rock Star, Monster Energy, and Red Bull drinks are not even contenders because of their taste.  Enter Give Energy. First, it tastes good. If you've ever had a mojito, you'll recognize the taste. Now, it won't taste like a mojito you get at a good Mexican restaurant, but the vital combination of citrus and mint is here and the two balance one another out overall. Sometimes you taste more of the grapefruit; other times you taste more of the mint. Second, it works -- it gets me past the two o'clock crash. The energy you get is a clean, stimulant, awake and aware effect, with a gradual fade out and not a crash. I've found that if I have one in the morning after working out, and if I work out in the evening, then I'm good for the day. Consuming it this way doesn't interfere with your sleep, either. Finally, I felt like I got a good deal. Compare the price of this to a Monster Energy Mean Bean 12-pack and see what I mean.  So all in all, Give Energy does the job, tastes good, can be consumed regularly, and has a great price.

I mixed this with some vanilla almond milk at about half the recommended strength and that ended up working well. It wasn't chalky or gritty. I used a shaker cup but I think an immersion blender would have been better as there were one or two clumps. I was surprised that it was pea protein based, because it didn't taste ""beany"" at all, as pea protein powders often do.  The mocha flavor is faint and the chocolate predominates. That's fine by me!  This is great for vegans and vegetarians in that it has a lot of protein, including all the essential amino acids (it lacks asparagine and glutamine but you don't need huge intake of those except in times of illness and stress). It also is really high in iron, which is nice. It has a little fiber. Another thing I love is that there are few to no carbohydrates -- this stuff is not loaded with sugar like many competing products are. And the sodium levels aren't bad, especially if you are using this as a meal replacement.

I've been hearing and seeing more and more people utilizing Cacao. It is said that ""cacao is the purest form of chocolate you can consume, which means it is raw and much less processed than cocoa powder or chocolate bars. Cacao is thought to be the highest source of antioxidants of all foods and the highest source of magnesium of all foods. It has been used throughout many cultures for years for health purposes and even used as a high trade commodity. Cacao powder contains more fiber and calories than cocoa powder since more of the nutrients from the whole bean are still intact. Cacao is an excellent source of monounsaturated fats, cholesterol-free saturated fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, natural carbohydrates, and protein that make it an excellent source of nutrients."" I mean the benefits seem so good I figure I have to try this stuff out, so when the opportunity to test out the organic cacoa powder came about I hopped on it right away. This is a rather large amount considering I don't really do much baking but I do think I'll try a recipe or two at some point I just have yet to make the time. So upon opening this I immediately got a good whiff of what smelled to me like cocoa, I grew up on the stuff plus I do like dark chocolate so I imagined that this would have a similar smell and/or taste to both. I took a teaspoon and scooped a small amount out to give it a taste and it is bitter! Really bitter, I mean cocoa is too but this had an even stronger bitter taste than I recall of cocoa. This stuff definitely needs a sweetener. So the first time I tried this I did so in oatmeal along with cherries and honey and this came out quite delicious, my toddler definitely appeared to be a fan. The second time I tried this in a smoothie with some banana, organic of course as well as almond butter and some almond milk and this was divine. I just about inhaled the entire thing, knowing about the benefits allows me to really enjoy using this cocao powder guilt free. I have not had the opportunity to try out any other brands so I don't have anything to compare this to but I have enjoyed using it and the size of the bag especially given the price I paid was well worth it.

Loose perls almost always have a better flavor and longer shelf life than bagged versions (which are basically single servings of tea dust, often oxidized), however as in all things, there are many levels of quality and you generally get what you pay for.  This particular brand of gunpowder tea is far above average, and offers a lot of bang for the buck: > Consistently fresh (not oxidized like many cheaper bulk varieties). > Air-proof packaging. > Nice tight 'perls', with minimal breakage and minimal tea dust. > Organically grown.  It brews up a very clean clear pale chartreuse color (with only a trace of fine sediment), with a flavorful and gently herbaceous edge that's not too bitter (provided you don't brew it too long or too strong), and it can be enjoyed hot or cold, and with or without condiments.  In my household, we mostly lean towards plain and unadorned, but sometimes switch to a little honey with either milk or lemon.  Note: Although FAR less dusty than most, a small trace of fine sediment is unavoidable when brewing ALL loose teas, and this one is no exception.  The small traces of sediment that appears in the bottom of the pitcher after straining is normal and doesnt affect flavor.  However, if you're a stickler for pristine appearance (say, for a dinner party), you can easily run the strained tea though a paper coffee filter to obtain a perfectly clear appearance.  Recommended.  Brewing instructions (for 1/2 gal): If I'm brewing several days worth just for myself, I'll fill a 3 qt stainless steel sauce pan with just over 2 qts water, heat it to 180F on my induction plate (about 6-7 mins), turn off the heat, then add 1/4 cup of tea pearls and let it steep for exactly 3 mins.

If you're a reasonably intelligent person, you can buy fruit and vegetable juice powder in bulk, from various manufacturers for literally 1/10th the cost.  These bottles of Juice Plus cost no more than $5 to manufacture, if I had to guess.  The bottling and labeling is probably more costly than the product in the capsules.  The outlandish, ridiculous claims this company makes is mind boggling. I don't know how they haven't been shut down for fraud.  Clever ""loophole"" wording, and high priced lawyers are probably how this company continues to stay open, and peddles this overpriced garbage.  I'm not saying these capsules provide NO nutritional benefit, but to get any substantial benefit from them, you'd have to take 10-20 capsules a day, which would not be very cost effective.  When you buy a standard fruit/vegetable juice powder concentrate, you routinely take 1 TBSP (15 grams) of the powder.  These capsules are 750mg, so therefore, you would need to take 20 to get what I would call a nutritionally substantial dosage.  I have taken this product and noticed zero benefit, because there's little to no benefit to be found in the miniscule dosages these capsules provide.  If you're taking this stuff and you're having the placebo effect, great.  Keep taking it. Placebo is just as powerful as anything.  But for someone who's not easily fooled, spend your money elsewhere.  Gram for gram, this might be the most expensive nutritional supplement ever created, when you factor in the dosage needed to have significant effects on someone's nutritional profile.

To order the same quantity (2-4. 8 ounce packs) of smoked salmon from another merchant I have done business with in the past would have cost double, including shipping, so decided to initially give this a try.  Yes, this is farmed raised. BUT, unless you are ordering Scottish smoked salmon directly from Scotland (and paying huge shipping costs) you will not find wild salmon anywhere, anymore. Last time I had wild, was when living in Cornwall, UK and local fish monger purchased right off the boats and sent down the quay to the local smoke house. My guess is, today, probably 80% of all salmon from Scotland is farm raised.  The salmon is wonderful, can't recommend too highly. Only, one minor negative, slices are not separated with waxed paper. Just make sure to bring up to near room temperature to make separating easier.  Strongly suggest paying extra for one or two day expedited shipping as with 2 packs it adds very little to the total cost. Remove from shipping box immediately on receipt and either refrigerate for immediate (7-10 days) use, or just pop in the freezer for use within the next 2-6 months ( don't recommend freezing for longer).  Best order value I have found is 4 packs= 2 pounds total, with absolute fastest shipping. Total cost with shipping comes to about $50 a pound, which is very reasonable.  IMPORTANT NOTE!  Don't wait too long when this salmon becomes available. Once Amazon runs out, it can be several months before it becomes available again. If they are out of stock, fill out the notification so you'll be notified when next shipment arrives.  Lastly. When I used to dine occasionally ant the old Riverfront dining room at the Savoy Hotel in London they would bring a small complimentary appetizer as follows.

The truth is: the lion's share of ""tuna"" available in the U.S. today is really escolar, a fish that many call toxic. In reality, escolar is not exactly toxic, but if eaten in amounts more than about six ounces at a time, it will very likely lead to a bad case of stomach cramps and diarrhea. The problem with escolar is that the fish contains a large amount of indigestible waxy compounds; these compounds make the fish taste as if it contained a lot of natural fish oils, but the gut cannot digest these waxy, oil-like molecules and they pass through the body quickly...in many cases, far too quickly! Escolar is a lot cheaper and more plentiful than real albacore tuna, and that's why it's taken the place of tuna in fish markets, grocery stores, and restaurants. Even highly priced sushi-grade tuna is, more often than not, escolar.  Are we all the victims of false advertising? No, federal food laws allow escolar to be sold under various misleading names including white tuna and solid white tuna.  So what can you do to make certain that you are not eating escolar? Well, one solution is to buy American Tuna MSC Certified Sustainable Caught Albacore Tuna. I tried it and I am thoroughly sold on the product! I'll never go back to buying fraudulent escolar ""tuna"" again.  From the first moment I opened the can of American Tuna, I knew that this was the real stuff...the one that I was used to eating in my youth more than forty-five years ago. It smelled better. It tasted better. It flaked better. And to top it off, it make me feel good about my purchase because it was genuine MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) sustainably caught albacore tuna.  What does that mean? It means that the fishery meets the strict environmental standards set by the MSC and the fish are harvested in a sustainable and well-managed fishery. For me, it just means I'm being a caretaker of the ocean and its inhabitants rather than a plunderer.  But it really gets back to taste; that's the critical factor. I did a taste comparison. I still had a can of the store-bought brand ""solid white tuna"" on hand. So I opened both cans--the American Tuna, and the ""solid white tuna"" (escolar)--and compared the two. I added the usual ingredients I use to make a tasty tuna salad (olive oil, diced onion, salt, lemon juice, capers, mayonnaise) and tried the two side-by-side. There was no comparison: the American Tuna was far superior in flavor. I ended up throwing away the other one, even though I ended up wasting good olive oil and capers in the process.  [Tip: be sure not to throw away the liquor in the can with the American Tuna; it is nutritional gold and good tasting, too...just add it back into your recipe and the flaked tuna will absorb it nicely.]  In the future I will probably buy this product at a specialty store not too far from my home. There, American Tuna sells for about a dollar cheaper per can  than I can get it here. But if you cannot find a local dealer for this tuna, then it is worth your money to buy it here online.","Finally guaranteed real tuna, not escolar!",1380153600,26.0,,,case local liquor lion's genuine away price gold name thoroughly i'll taste i've amount hand use find indigestible stuff...the natural advertising nicely sell tuna sell escolar)--and oil factor share solution add salt product store-bought usual too...just open fishery reality six harvest eaten federal dealer fraudulent nutritional get misleading grocery nave many allow waxy molecule waste market flavor problem buying today solid compound gut caper tip sure take mean feel real certify contains superior money sushi-grade store well long strict olive brand food inhabitant really msc trust that's cramp one stewardship lot lemon flake back future digest place american add toxic compare escolar cans--the far youth false likely good home environmental forty-five large quickly use meet probably end worth online salad cheap first come quickly...in cannot certain side-by-side eating time ounces highly call purchase well-managed stomach various top white truth buy bad ago still juice recipe standard even sustainably onion taste dice albacore mayonnaise lead per year plentiful marine victim catch make plunderer case never ingredient process moment pas i'm oil specialty set caretaker ocean contain often sustainable diarrhea law mean critical absorb try though include council body smell comparison oil-like two go knew well throw available u.s exactly get tasty taste throw dollar fish restaurant store amount rather

Christensen,"If you are an English or Irish Breakfast Tea drinker and enjoy the heavier/maltier side of the tea spectrum, this may be a nice choice for you.  The is particularly true if you drink your English Breakfast tea in bags or pouches (you owe it to yourself to get a good infuser like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Adagio-Teas-ingenuiTEA-Bottom-Dispensing-Teapot/dp/B000FPN8TK  Some reviewers have complained that this tea comes as mostly dust and fannings, but I did not find that to be the case with my package.  It definitely contained more dust/fannings than some of the finer grade Assam I buy from a local tea shop, but I'd attribute that more to the fact that it is being mail-ordered in small quantities and not being graded again after receipt.  (see photo for the character of my batch at the bottom of the bag once I'd consumed most of the tea in the bag).  As to the flavor profile and character, I should first say that my taste preference is on the extreme side of earthy/malty with as little astringency (tannin) as possible.  I drink my tea with milk and agave syrup as a general rule.  My typical favorites are certain Assam teas (which I typically brew heavy but short) and Irish or Scottish Breakfast blends.  I also generally enjoy good quality Keemun and Dianhong teas.  My general reaction to this particular tea blend is that it stands up well to a heavier brew (the way I like) but it is very sensitive to over-brewing.  The directions say 3-5 minutes, but I found that a 3 minute brew at 195 to be just at the edge of my preference for astringency, but having a great full body, malty character, and more exotic/floral notes than a typical Assam or Breakfast blend.  The smell of the dried leaves almost seems like there is some bergamot (what gives Earl Grey its distinct flavor) but there is no mention of any additives to this tea blend, so I have to assume that it is coming from one of the more exotic varieties of tea used in this blend.  Speaking of additives, I've poked through the leaf mix and there is nothing in this blend besides tea leaves, so please ignore reviewers that mention bits of citrus or other additives - this looks to be a pure tea blend (and this is also stated by the producer).  In summary, if you like a good hearty cup of tea and are looking for something with a bit more complexity and a different flavor profile, but still with the maltiness and caffeine kick of a good Breakfast tea, give this one a try.

Nah.  Used it on chicken TWICE (the reviews I'd read slobbered all over how good it was supposed to be with chicken), and it SUCKED. Not that it was nauseating, it just had no flavor at all. We have a pretty broad palate--like all kinds of foods--but this had  no real flavor profile at all. I've read it described as 'lemony', etc.: don't you believe it. I loaded the food up with lemon and this stuff, and it pretty much...just lay there.  Frankly: we grew up poor and couldn't afford too many spices or extras, and my mom's roast chicken with JUST salt, pepper and butter rocked WAAAAAAAAY more than this. Save your money is my instinct. I still plan to try it mixed with some other herbs, so I'll update, and hopefully find a recipe or two that is worth the investment.  The company DOES give you a LOT for your money, in the way of sheer amount of the spice that they send you. I'd be very open to anyone here who wanted to send me recipes or ways to use it that might change my initial impression. So look out for future updates.  UPDATE: OK, I'm finally getting around to updating this, now that I've had time to try some of the suggestions of the kind commenters below. I like it pretty well now that I've tried it mixed with a few other herbs and especially on flat bread. It's killer with flat bread dipped in fresh garlic lightly saute'd in butter, then mixed with the sumac and some Mexican oregano (try it: you'll never use any other kind of oregano again--I used to HATE oregano, now I use the Mex. kind all the time).

The sap is collected from the flower bud, boiled and then dehydrated. The resulting sugar is dark brown crystals, very slightly burnt-sugary in taste but very pleasant in flavor.  Although this sugar is not low in calories, having the same calorie count as cane sugar, it is low on the glycemic index.  Because this is unrefined sugar, it has more nutrients (such as iron, zinc, magnesium, potassium and 12 B vitamins) and also a fiber called ""inulin"" which may slow glucose absorption.  This inulin is the reason coconut sugar has that lower glycemic index and I'm assuming it's a better sugar for diabetics but that's for a doctor or nutritionist to decide.  You can use this sugar in any food that calls for sweetening.

According to my DH, it's the best hot chocolate I've ever made.  Two drawbacks to the use of coconut sugar are:  1)  Cost.  One ounce of coconut sugar costs approximately 22 cents compared to 7 cents for cane sugar.  2)  Environmental impact of the overuse of coconut palm trees for sugar production.  The sap is collected from the flower bud and this prevents the bud from developing into a coconut.  Too much demand for coconut sugar could lead to a smaller supply of actual coconuts.  So common sense tells me that people who are not diabetic should continue to also use other sources of sugar and not exclusively coconut sugar.

1351,407453,1,True,"08 4, 2014",A1R5UPSOH21D3D,B00338BVQ8,Tony NYC,"The Barilla pasta MADE and SOLD in the US is the same American made pasta as Ronzoni. The Barilla pasta sold in this country is made in Iowa and New York. It is NOTHING like the Barilla pasta sold in Italy, which isn't anything special anyway, but this is worse.  The ingredients in this pasta are Semolina, Durum FLOUR, Niacin Vitamin B3, Iron (Ferrous Sulfate), Thiamine Mononitrate Vitamin B1, Riboflavin Vitamin B2, Folic Acid Vitamin B9 (those are all the artificial vitamins that are required to be added if pasta is made in this country. The flour content is high.  In Italy, in order to call a product PASTA, even in the worst pastas, they do not allow more than 3% flour. The grades for pasta in Italy are designated with the letter i  PASTA 101 In Italy the regulations as to what can be called pasta are the following:   Pasta: Dried pasta with three subcategories  (i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semola di grano duro), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.  So, in Italy, the WORST product that can be called ""Pasta"" can only have a TOTAL of 3% flour.  In Italy they would have to call this product, ""noodles' ""Macaroni"" or anything else but PASTA.  So, Barilla sold in this country doesn't meet the criteria to be labeled as Pasta in Italy. The Barilla in Italy is grade iii . This American Barilla product doesn't meet that criteria.  Goes to show what advertising will do. Yes, Barilla is the number one selling pasta in Italy. It's one of Italy's WORST pasta's, but it's cheap supermarket pasta and sells the most in Italy.  A better choice would be to buy ANY pasta imported from Italy that says ""Made FROM 100% Durham Semolina. Not made ""WITH 100% Durham Semolina."" If it says ""WITH"", it means it has SOME 100% Durham Semolina,  My favorite happens to be DiVella. Other good brands that don't break the bank are DeCecco (a little over priced)  Anna, Farrara, or any brand imported from Italy. The ones you see cheap in cellophane bags in the supermarket. They are FAR better than Ronzoni or Barila.  Those are the basics. If you want to go a step UP from these, you can look for an Italian Pasta that is Bronze Extruded such as the DiVella line of Bronze Extruded pastas. Not all DiVella pasta's are bronze extruded, so check the package. Bronze extruded pasta, made from a high grade Durham Semolina with NO flour is what you get when you buy DiVella bronze extruded. When the pasta is extruded through bronze dies, it is more porous and HOLDS ON to the sauce. It is more expensive because it takes longer to make using the bronze extrusion method.  You can NEVER cook pasta that is made with flour ""al dente"". It is either uncooked or over cooked. No in between. Horrible.  If you are on a budget, buy Anna, Farrara or ANY pasta imported from Italy that is made FROM 100% Durham Semolina. If money is no object, get a bronze extruded pasta. Another brand that is excellent is Cucina Antica. It is imported by a company called Cucina Antica but is made to the highest standards of grade i pasta in Italy.",GARBAGE AMERICAN MADE PASTA WITH FLOUR,1407110400,9.0,"{'Size:': ' 16-Ounce (Pack of 16)', 'Flavor:': ' Rigatoni'}",,label price horrible go antica ferrous cook dececco break long dy country acid advertise designate like sell sell basic order macaroni sell extrude dry york accord subcategory product barila expensive durum one durham porous cucina farrara italy get nothing high iii favorite category bad allow al object semolina vitamin mean budget ronzoni must iron money italy's anna good duro semola line italian bad letter brand supermarket little thiamine dente pasta grade one part niacin grano new package divella barilla make american added whole bronze high far low folic ii yes company good di whole-meal semolato bank step riboflavin number want cheap regulation call would method integrale hold check buy artificial pasta's noodle anyway standard even see water brand meet flour else meal criterion bag make cooked extrusion either never choice sulfate say ingredient special allowance soft-wheat sauce pasta mononitrate wheat require vitamin import total look excellent grade take iowa content call subcategories happen go use show three uncooked another cellophane anything follow

I did open a box when we received them just to make sure that they weren't going to be a disappointment. They snapped just as expected when bitten into and the flavor was great. A huge sigh of relief! These were perfect! The only difference was that the handle nowadays is not a white string stapled to the box. Instead, there is a cardboard handle that folds up from the box. It's integrated into the printed design of the box too, so it is cute and convenient. I would have prefered the string simply because I wanted these to be as nostalgic and vintage looking as possible, but honestly the overall look of the boxes was terrific without the string handle.

Well the word ""about"" is a bit of stretch. Using their measurement by weight, 245g x 2 servings = 490g and only 411g in the can.

If I'd read the ingredients list, I would have spotted it, fourth one from the top: Sugar, roasted peanuts, corn syrup, HYDROGENATED PALM KERNAL....  This is easily the single most harmful ingredient modern food and snack companies are cramming into our candy and baked goods. For years, we've been warned by consumer groups to read the ingredients list and avoid anything with an ingredient beginning with hydro.... The human body isn't capable of processing hydrogenated foods. As one consumer group noted: When hydrogenated oil is made, these healthy fats are converted into a new type of fatty acid, known as a trans fat. Trans fats are not at all good for one's health. It adds, Consumption of hydrogenated oil has been linked with diabetes, coronary disease, and obesity in a wide number of scientific studies. Okay, candy makes one fat. No surprise there. But many candy manufacturers make wonderful candy products without hydrogenated oils. Snickers, for example. The hydrogenated oils are denser, and melt at higher temperatures, which means the bodies can't break them down and process them like other oils. And as someone who's loved Baby Ruth candy bars since childhood, the current candy just isn't as good. Not only are modern candies made with genetically modified foods, they're also made with high fructose corn syrup, which cuts more corners and means the candy doesn't taste as good as you remember it. (It's why Coca-Cola isn't as good.) So find out what you're eating before you buy it. These are going into the trash. Hopefully candy makers will stop making this stuff with hydrogenated oils.

They are not created equal. Not in taste, strength, or fragrance. It's up to each individual to find the brew that they prefer.  Oolong tea is a product of the Camellia sinesis plant -- buds, leaves and stems.  The same plant used for black and green teas, but the processing is what renders the end product, making a significant difference.  Prince of Peace tea is organic (a plus) blending black tea, for richer taste,  with green tea for the well known health benefits.  Caffeine is approximately 30-40 mg per cup, with a cup of coffee significantly more.  I find the this tea to be on the milder side and I prefer stronger tea flavor.  But, I have been very happy using two tea bags per cup and it still remains cost effective.  I sweeten my tea with a little honey and find this particular blend divine.  Oolong tea has significant touted health benefits, many not well researched.  However, many believe it helps with weight management,  and there are some sites that propose it even lessens the risk of cancer, all the way to protecting dental health.  All good things, but I don't particularly care, if I don't like the product, and I like this one.  Remember that everything is to be taken in moderation.  Even the healthy benefits of tea.  Over consumption may cause difficulties related to too much caffeine.  And there is some evidence that it can flush calcium, so you may need to limit intake to three cups, or less per day, if you have osteoporosis.  Just read interactions and contraindications for all items that you regularly partake of, just to be on the safe side.  I visited the seller's website.  I was moved by the Prince of Peace world relief efforts and the orphanage they oversee, serving over 100 orphan children.

I mean I don't eat a ton of c-bars, but there are several I rotate between, e.g., 3 Musketeers, Kit Kat, Butterfinger, Milky Way, Reese's Cups...  I was therefore quite excited to tear open the wrapper and bite into my first ever Butterfinger Peanut Butter cup (I've probably had 4-5 of them over the past two weeks).  Here's my experience:  First of all, these are not Reese's BP cups.  Keep telling yourself that.  These are not Reese's...these are not Reese's.  There are two cups per wrapper, but the cups are square, not round, and there is no paper wrapper for each cup.  As soon as you take your first bite you get a strong whiff of that classic Butterfinger Bar aroma.  There is a generous amount of chocolate around each creamy center...perhaps a little too much? (like that's possible), but as I bit into the cup I got that Butterfinger taste without the Butterfinger crunch.  Oh there are orange Butterfinger bits suspended in the creamy peanut butter filling, but the filling is quite sweet.  In Reese's cups the flavor contrast between the sweet chocolate and the slightly salty PB inside is what I really like.  In Butterfinger peanut butter cups, however, the chocolate and the filling are both sweet.  That's OK, but it can take you by surprise if you weren't expecting it. And now, after 4-5 I still get taken back at the first bite because somewhere in my brain it's thinking ""Reese's"" until I take that first bite and my brain gets derailed from it's Reese's track.  I don't know that I would say that Butterfinger is better than Reese's or vice versa...they are just different.  The bottom line?  I still like Reese's cups better, but I wouldn't turn one of these down if someone offered me one.  If you like a little sweet and salty, then go with Reese's. If you like a sweet treat and just a little of that sticky orange Butterfinger crunch in your teeth instead of a lot (like you get with a bar), then go with the Butterfinger cups.

When I saw these, I figured it would be a nice surprise for him and I could feel better about it since they are at lest all natural and colored with real food instead of artificial stuff.  These are delicious. I got the orange one and it tastes like oranges! Which is great, because if you try cheap ones that are artificially flavored, they tend to taste like sugar with a hint of orange. But this tastes very refreshing and not like those gross ones.  This has only a few, simple ingredients. And you can read all of them!  This is colored with beets, which means no artificial colorings. You can tell that it must be, because (as you can see in my pictures) it is a very light orange color as opposed to the highlighter-orange of other brands that are artificially flavored.  It sets up really well, and it very smooth, not grainy at all. I don't know why but for some reason I would worried it might be lol!  It just such such a simple desert to make and each box makes the typical amount of other jello's.  At first I felt like they were expensive but you get 6 of them in a pack. When you go someplace and get pre-made ones, they are about this price anyways and not natural. So, in my mind, that makes these worth it to me.  You can obviously just make it plain, like I did to test it out and like you see in my pictures, or you can add fruit or whipped cream or whatever you like.

I also like how simple the ingredients list is: popcorn, oil, salt. The cheese flavor is pretty good too, but pretty mild. If you've had the regular smart food cheese popcorn (the one loaded with fat and calories) this pales in comparison - however there are no weird chemical tastes like some other light cheese popcorn brands have.

I'm guessing that you've have these before, or you probably aren't shopping for a four-pound bag.  :)  If you've never tried them, though, I really recommend picking one up at the local store before getting so many.  For me, these ""fun sized"" candies like you'd hand out at Halloween are perfect for York Peppermint Patties.  While I like them, I quickly reach a saturation point where I start to think that I've had too much.  A full-sized one is just too much for me, but one of these small ones is a perfect little snack and pick-me-up during the day.  The mint part is pretty rich, IMO, and why I don't like to have too much of it.  My bag arrived completely fresh with an expiration date 10 months after it arrived, which is quite good for a bag of candy.  Luckily, I ordered these in January when it's fairly cool here.  My one caution, in case you've never done it and haven't thought about this, is think twice before ordering in the summer.  If you've ever gotten a box full of semi-melted candy, you know what I'm talking about.  One great thing is that these are all individually wrapped, so at worst you'd have some misshapen candies inside of the wrappers.  So, not a big deal with these, but I wanted to mention it because I've gotten melted candy delivered.  Other reviewers have discussed the use of PGPR (a chemical) to replace cocoa butter in these.  It's something to consider, for sure, but I don't eat candy as a health food.  :)  Also, because I tend to eat maybe one a day, I don't think that I'd get enough PGPR to be a problem.  If you're a YPP addict, though, maybe look into that a bit more.",Arrived fresh - just be careful about ordering in the summer time,1453161600,,,,know local ypp snack reviewer much expiration hand i've think quite use maybe luckily peppermint like ever caution order candy recommend chemical patty york perfect misshapen completely think health one size order individually wrapper four-pound pgpr get discuss many thing enough pick-me-up i'd big problem something sure great wrap wanted date box fairly bad fun little eat food really bag one shop part replace deal imo point good consider twice guess quickly probably talk bit full cool month butter january cocoa saturation melt full-sized also start inside addict day arrive pick summer rich tend reach fresh case never store gotten i'm mint try mention though look candy deliver semi-melted get do halloween small pretty review

They're definitely not banana chips, but they do have a complex and interesting flavor -- like bananas, only concentrated, so a bit more tart than you might expect (which makes sense, since all the water has been removed).  The texture is pretty similar to other freeze-dried foods -- a bit crunchy, but gets softer once these pick up a little moisture.  If you eat these dry, they have a bit of a tendency to stick in your teeth, so be aware of that.  (However, they are definitely more convenient than real bananas if you just want a snack -- they won't turn brown on your kitchen counter!)  I also tried them in oatmeal.  I think I liked, but didn't love, the texture after they'd been soaked in water a bit.  Other people may have different feelings, though.  (I think because the pieces are fairly big -- at least 1/4 inch thick, if not thicker -- it takes a little while for the centers of the slices to soak up liquids, which makes the outside softer than the inside if you're using them in cereal.)

I love the convenience of pouring this in a coffee cup and warming it up in the microwave for a minute. It's thicker than regular broth but don't think ""thick"" like it sounds - it's more dense. Where you can see the bottom of your cup with regular broth, you can't see it with this bone broth. So it's a bit heartier but not as salty which I like. In comparing the ingredients of this brand with others, I found this to be the most natural of the bone broths I researched, with less sodium as well.  The smell is a bit off-putting for me but I enjoy the taste so it's a win. I also read that bone broth has healing properties.

I recently started eating clean and thought it would help with my menstrual cycle since it has worked for everything else healthwise. I also quit coffee when I started eating clean because I am sensitive to caffeine, but couldn't kick the habit before. I also stopped eating sugar other than from fruits and use raw honey very very sparingly. So I decided to try this tea to see if it would have any effect on the major depression, irritability, and cramping I experience. This was my first cycle since I started eating clean so I do not know if things will get better in the future. I did not follow the 7-10 days before the first day of the period like the package says. It was like a day before.  I started to have worse cramps than usual a few days before my period started. This was unusual for me because usually the cramps don't start until after my period begins.  I was very hydrated and I always eat tons of veggies and things that are good for you, no chemical-laden foods or sugary cereals or yogurts. I just eat whole food.  The cramps I had during this period were blazingly more painful and intolerable than my prior periods. I am not sure if drinking the tea had any effect whatsoever on my cycle, but I am rating it 5 stars because it tastes amazing and it seems to have soothed my cramps a bit. I usually take advil for cramps, but after reading the ingredients list, I decided I won't take advil again. So, this period caused me greater pain than usual, despite my healthy lifestyle. Perhaps this is a problem that won't be easily fixed. I'll report later if there are any changes and will continue to consume the tea to see if there's any changes.

2109,411040,1,True,"06 17, 2013",A2L73KNIMIF3TY,B0037B6IZU,AP,"Titanium Dioxide Classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans  Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen ''possibly carcinogen to humans''. Titanium dioxide accounts for 70% of the total production volume of pigments worldwide. It is widely used to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, plastics, papers, inks, foods, and toothpastes. It is also used in cosmetic and skin care products, and it is present in almost every sunblock, where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light.  With such widespread use of titanium dioxide, it is important to understand that the IARC conclusions are based on very specific evidence. This evidence showed that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation*. The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, it should be noted that the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer.  The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) is Canada's hazard communication standard. The WHMIS Controlled Products Regulations require that chemicals, listed in Group 1 or Group 2 in the IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans, be classified under WHMIS Class D2A (carcinogenic). The classification decision on titanium dioxide has been published on the IARC website and in a summary article published in The Lancet  Representatives from Health Canada (National Office of WHMIS) recently consulted with the Quebec CSST and CCOHS (the two main agencies providing WHMIS classifications to the public) regarding the implications of the IARC decision to the WHMIS classification of titanium dioxide. It was agreed that titanium dioxide does now meet the criteria for WHMIS D2A (carcinogen) based on the information released by IARC to date, and that it is not necessary to wait for release of the full monograph.  Manufacturers and suppliers of titanium dioxide are advised to review and update their material safety data sheets and product labels based on this new information as soon as possible. Employers should review their occupational hygiene programs to ensure that exposure to titanium dioxide dust is eliminated or reduced to the minimum possible. Workers should be educated concerning this potential newly recognized risk to their health and trained in proper work procedures.  * Intratracheal administration is an exposure procedure that introduces the material directly into the lungs via the trachea, bypassing protective mechanisms in the respiratory system.

With these having no sugar, I was a little concerned as I usually end up catching a wicked aftertaste from alternate sweeteners such as stevia and Splenda.  Also, I've had a few unpleasant experiences with the texture of gluten-free products.  These TRU Chocolate dark chocolate pretzel balls are great, though.  They have the usual bitter/sour-ish flavor that I expect from a dark chocolate, and the pretzel center has a wonderfully crunchy texture.  If you're on a sugar-restrictive diet, but are craving some dark chocolate goodness, these are well worth trying.  If you are on a low-fat diet, these might not be for you, as they have a somewhat high level of saturated fat.  Also, these are listed as dairy and nut free, but are labeled as being produced on equipment possibly shared with these and other allergens.

Most people probably wouldn't taste it, but if you try the regular peppermint and the Vitality, you will notice a difference. It's initial flavor, like most others, is much stronger, and mellows within a minute or so. That is not to say that it loses its flavor. It lasts as long as other Trident gum.

Pomegranate Pucker tasted like cough syrup, Too Berry Blueberry tasted exactly like blueberry, with a hint of creaminess. Mango Tango tasted like dehydrated mango pieces that they put in organic cereal--it tasted stale, like dried mango that has been on the shelf for far too long. Strawberry Smash tasted like strawberry Fig Newtons which if you haven't had before don't really taste like strawberries. On the plus side, Very Cherry tasted like any other cherry lollipop, Sour Apple tasted like a fresh pear (probably sweetened with pear juice) and Wet Face Watermelon comes close to Jolly Rancher's watermelon with a slightly muddled flavor that isn't as crisp as Jolly Rancher's.  I've gone through the entire bag and sorted them to find out approx how many of each there are in the bag. Note that I didn't count each one (sorting them took long enough as it were).

It's hard to beat the cherry/strawberry/blueberry cheesecake and raspberry lemonade flavors other brands offer.  Looks like most of the grosser flavors like pomegranate are going to the neighborhood kids this halloween.

Hopefully my kid nieces will enjoy these tremendously, as they're the ones I originally bought them for.  Notes to the founders of Yummy Earth:  I'd like to mention that the naming of Wet Face watermelon is very unfortunate as it reminds me of an offensive racial slur in case the owners of the company happen to come across this review.  I'd love to see the following flavors added to the line: cinnamon, lemon and a true sour green apple (add a citric acid to the apple recipe).

That said, while this is handy, there are a couple of issues.  One is that the tuna is pretty dry.  It's seasoned, but this isn't like tuna salad with mayo.  This is spicy, which I like, and the spice builds up, which I don't mind.  The crackers are really good, but because the tuna doesn't stick together well, you need a lot more crackers than you get.  Also, there is a little plastic spreader thing (I hesitate to call it a spoon or a knife - it's kind of a cross between the two) that is hard to use since the tuna is too dry.  I suggest taking a plastic fork along - it gets the tuna out of the can easily, and when you run out of crackers, it's easier to eat what's left of the tuna.  This is decent.  If you like spicy tuna, the taste is pretty good.  It just needs to be a little juicier than it is.

I know some reviewers have been complaining about the texture. My suggestion is to let the honey sit in a cool area for two days to let the capping rise to the top and completely solidify. When I received mine, the product had been shipped on its side and it was in a liquid state from the heat. The capping was floating at the wrong angle. This caused the capping to mix into the rest of the honey when I turned it upright. To fix this, simply let it sit somewhere cool so the crystallization process solidifies the honey and allows you to scrape the cap away and get to the honey beneath it -- it should no longer contain all the gritty parts of the capping.  I love honey comb, however, so I enjoy eating this honey directly from the jar. I just received it yesterday and I've finished half of the jar. It's that good.  This is the only light honey I've been able to eat from the jar. Others have been too sweet. This one is nearly perfect to my tastes.  Another reviewer said that YS honey is better than this one because YS has an organic label. It is insanely hard for bee keepers in America to offer organic honey, and this company practices organic methods and does not use chemicals on their farms. I trust them, and I seriously doubt that the bees are venturing too far from home if they already have an abundant supply of flowers to choose from. This is as organic as honey can get in America.  YS honey tastes horrible compared to this honey. It's almost sickeningly sweet and impossible for me to eat from the jar. This one speaks for itself. I'm going to have to buy a bigger jar for it to last through a months worth of tea drinking. I will admit, though, that I absolutely love the royal jelly offered by YS; it tastes better than their other honeys.  While I prefer dark honey like honeydew and neem, this one is packed on site and never enters a barrel. This is becoming a problem for me and dark honey. I want honey that hasn't touched a barrel, and I haven't found a dark honey that offers this.  Try this honey if you want something truly raw. If you don't like honey comb then you shouldn't try this. You will get a mouthful of honey comb from the capping, and it is nutritious but chewy.  The lids and jars are BPA free. There is a seal between the jar and lid. This is rare; lots of honeys tend to lack a seal and touch the lid through transit. If the lid is made of metal, chances are it has a food liner made of plastisol (which contains PVC,) or it has a food liner that is hiding BPA in it. When you find organic honeys that have metal lids and the honey has touched the lid through transit, then it isn't as ""organic"" as it used to be.

This is a loose leaf tea which arrives in a canister wrapped with paper written on in Chinese. Inside is a foil bag and a plastic clip to seal the bag shut. The tea is fragrant and bold when you take a sniff of it. The leaves are large and fully formed. When I brewed it, I used one tablespoon for a two cup serving (1 tsp. for the pot, and 1 tsp. per cup of water). I think I may actually have brewed it too strong and could have either stepped it less or used fewer leaves. However, tastes do vary with tea so you'll have to adjust to what suits you.  I found this to be a bold and nuanced jasmine tea. It has both the floral notes of jasmine as well as some of the bitter notes of green tea. The fusion makes for a heartier jasmine tea cup which feels like it'd go well with food, work as a morning breakfast drink, or a late afternoon pick-me-up. It has more malty notes and less floral/perfumey notes than some of the other jasmine tea that I've tried. This isn't a bad thing at all. It's just a different property. This is a refreshing tea which seems high in strength and quality and offers a complex experience.

She has a problem with gluten and stays away from wheat products. This mix allowed me to make her pancakes when she came up.  It turned out that I liked the mix so much, I use it in a lot of other baking occasions. The pancakes from this mix are better than a wheat-based pancake. I modify the recipe a little bit because I like to use buttermilk instead of the water called for on the box. Also, I have to use a lot more liquid as this mix really soaks up the liquid and can be too stiff using the same amount of liquid as the dry mix. . Basically, you mix eggs,oil, and buttermilk with the mix and voila - great pancakes. I use it as a thickener - like when I make a cobbler and my fruit is runny - a tablespoon or two in the fruit and it sets up nicely when baking. I also use it with oats in the topping of my crisp. A tablespoon or two with the oats along with brown sugar and butter makes a nice topping. When making muffins, if the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour, I use 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of this mix and my muffins turn out great and have great flavor.  I now order the 4-package deal that Amazon has. The price per package is better than I can find locally at the store.

They have a distinctive taste and have a pleasing texture.  Three pounds of olives may seem like a bunch of olives but we have worked our way through a significant amount of them in just a couple of weeks.  Here is how we store and use our olives (we do the same thing with black olives as well. We purchase Byzantine Country Olive Mix (5lb.) from Amazon ).  1. Drain liquid from the olives. 2. Add 1 jalapeno pepper with small holes sliced all sides of the pepper to a glass jar (quart size). 3.  Add olives  to your glass jar with the jalapeno pepper (sometimes we mix the castelvetrano and black olives in same jar). 4. Cover the olives and pepper with extra virgin olive oil. 5. put the lid on your jar and place it on your counter top or in cupboard. Keep the olives out of direct sunlight and away from any heat source.  Do NOT refrigerate! The olives will keep this way for weeks or months.  6. After you finish the olives from a jar, discard the pepper and you can use the remaining olive oil for cooking.  It has just a little kick from the pepper and gives a good flavor to food.  We learned about keeping olives this way from a clerk in a Mediterranean style market.  We have been doing this for years and have never had any olives go bad.
