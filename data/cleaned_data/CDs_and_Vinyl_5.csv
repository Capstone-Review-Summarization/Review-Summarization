0,653862,AVQZOFV1QYZPD,B000FEBWBC,Andrew Vice,True,"On their second LP, Citrus, Asobi Seksu sound like a band that has come into their own. The songwriting on Citrus far outclasses the work on their self-titled debut, with tracks like ""Thursday"" and ""Goodbye"" standing as some of the best tracks of 2006. Stylistically, the album is at times both more and less shoegazy than their debut. Tracks like ""Pink Cloud Tracing Paper"" and ""Red Sea"" sound like they would belong on a Slowdive record, whereas the aforementioned ""Goodbye"" is more of an alternative power-pop track, managing to be both playful and smart. There isn't really a single track on this record that isn't worth its weight, and the sequencing is exciting and well planned.  Ultimately, for any fan of shoegaze, alternative pop, or luscious female vocals, Citrus is a must-have. And, for any fan that enjoys this record, definitely check out their debut, which is a competent, if not quite as dynamic, record.

Two Door Cinema Club is a new(ish) band from Northern Ireland which created internet buzz with a couple of early singles in 2009, and in Spring 2010, this debut album was released. If you are unfamiliar with the band's sound, think along the lines of DFCF, the Shins, and other prefectly crafted indie-pop sounds.  ""Tourist History"" (10 tracks; 33 min.) starts off with a blast in ""Cigarettes in the Theatre"", full of crafty guitar interplay. The first thing that will strike you, though, is that lead singer Alex Alex Trimble sounds just like, and I do mean *just like*, Ben Gibbard. In fact, ""Do You Want It All?"" truly sounds like this is DCFC, not TDCC, and I mean this as a compliment of course. It's hard to pinpoint many highlights as such. Indeed, at just 10 tracks in barely over half an hour, this album breezes by in no time, and you will find yourself playing this again and again. Nothing revolutionary, but a delight from start to finish.  I finally had a chance to see these guys in concert last month at the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. From the first track ""Cigarettes in the Theatre"" on, the band put on a tremendous one hour set that was well receiced by the huge crowd. TDCC played all of the tracks from ""Tourist History"", along with a couple of promising sounding new tracks (""Kids"", ""Sleep Alone"", and ""Costume Party"").

7,1183298,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B0000087S0,Andre S. Grindle,False,"Rod Stewart had more or less been searching for one musical quality since the 1980's began. And that was balance. Of course,even though he operated in the rock scene there was all of a sudden this huge level of rock criticism that seemed to feel it was their duty to let artists now what was hot and what was not. In the meantime it was up to the artist to keep creating and see what happened. This always tended to exist in jazz and soul music critical circles. But by this time just about any artist creating seemed to be up for grabs. There seemed to be the need to cry ""sellout!"" to everyone with a popular inclination during this time period. And it went on for a long time after. It would seem that after the sleek,digital synthesizer/dance oriented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Camouflage/dp/B000002L5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Camouflage</a>&nbsp;Rod wasn't quite yet through with that contemporary sound. During this time artists such as Canada's Bryan Adams were really catching onto this side of Rod Stewart's musical impact. However I think something was still missing for him. Rod Stewart albums had always actually contained a cornucopia of the different sounds that made up rock n roll-from blues,to folky shuffles,rockabilly,soul and funk. How could this work for him in the 80's.    Well Rod Stewart wasn't as stubborn as say Van Morrison. He didn't exactly want to turn up his nose at a music industry that gave him a chance. This album therefore returns somewhat to that grab bags of musical effects that made Rod famous though still containing that mid 80's slick production. ""Here To Eternity"",""Red Hot In Black"" and the title song all feature that production style. But actually showcase more of a rock influence again,with sometimes harrowing lyrics full of regret and trepidation. ""Who's Gonna Take Me Home"" and ""A Night Like This"" showcase Rod's continuing interest in the heartland arena pop/rock styles of Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen from this era and are the more poppier numbers here. The upbeat danceable rock n soul of the hit ""Love Touch"" is full of that quality that makes Rod so distinctive and unique. On ""In My Own Crazy Way""...well musically with it's slower shuffle and popping horns it does in fact sound something like Van Morrison of his period. After the chilly,mournful ballad ""Ten Days Of Rain"" Rod closes with a revisit of John Lennon's reflectively beautiful Beatles standard ""In My Life"",done up near acapella.    Even though there's no possible way to musically compare the two albums,it's likely that this album might've had some intention of serving the purpose that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Every-Picture-Tells-a-Story/dp/B00000612P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Every Picture Tells a Story</a>&nbsp;did early in Rod's career. That is in demonstrating,in this case for a whole new generation his ability to gather up his influence along with the musical production styles of the era and come up with something commercially workable and creatively satisfying for the soul. I will say this album may have failed at that for two reasons. For one,there really aren't many songs that are heavily crafted with pop hooks people could easily connect to. Not only that,but the slickness of the production just wasn't what many Rod Stewart fans associated with his horse,whiskey soaked soulful wail of a voice. Rod is one of those few vocalists in rock who is able to express swagger and vulnerability all at the same time. It's the latter quality that shows up more here. Musically,lyrically and melodically there's a good deal of uncertainty here.

12,1091708,A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN,B000000SIF,Andrew R. Barnard,False,"Now that the Messiah has received popularity that some might deem excessive, we've all grown accustomed to every bar and nuance.  Handel's score is a masterpiece, hence its wide following, but for myself, having sung the work numerous times with local groups as well as hearing it on disc since infancy, there are times I want new, radical ideas.  I can testify that this reading from Nikolaus Harnoncourt and his Concentus Musicus Wien (an authentic group as fine as they come) is full of truly novel insights.  Every bar seems to convey a new emotion, a welcome relief from readings that seem to be a predictable, religious trudge.  But unlike many of his compatriots, Harnoncourt's lack of thick, gushy sentimentality isn't code for bland cheerfulness and lack of direction.  Drama is used to the extreme but the music moves with definite purpose.  What makes this reading revolutionary is that Harnoncourt seems to have overlooked a century of frequent performances that has tended towards stereotyping and monotony.  In this way, Harnoncourt's freshness may seem backward-looking.  But he combines a feel of great mystery and expectation with the intimacy and tenderness afforded by a period ensemble.  These are romantic interpretations in almost every way, though.  The nuance and affection in Harnoncourt's phrasing--which has a high dosage of unconstrained rubato--certainly isn't heard every day.  Among the soloists, all of which are front tier, the standout is Gerald Finley, whose vibrant, volatile singing fits perfectly with Harnoncourt's rethinking.  The professional Arnold Schoenberg Choir sings with conviction and pinpoint accuracy.  We feel the many surges in Harnoncourt's conducting conveyed with sensitivity across a wide range of expression.  In all, it's hard to point to a weakness in this recording outside of the fact that we only get one disc of selections.  I can't imagine what the whole work would sound like under such inspiration, but what we have is 77 minutes of transforming musicianship that would be hard to forget.",5,"07 4, 2013","Harnoncourt transforms the Messiah--mesmerizing, startling highlights",1372896000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},5.0,,relief schoenberg backward-looking local intimacy arnold code concentus performance record combine hard popularity surge score infancy read excessive gushy work way romantic like selection testify wide emotion disc monotony among come heard tend fine might rethink handel's freshness volatile professional time group can't musicianship get sings high we've gerald many towards transform hear expression harnoncourt's seem sensitivity convey sing great cheerfulness expectation bar reading radical century feel direction minute weakness whose finley religious range music unlike thick drama idea conviction tier trudge one grown fact inspiration new conducting unconstrained hence whole point compatriot mystery predictable interpretation sing use nikolaus affection perfectly truly outside lack want full frequent accustom almost deem across pinpoint bland would fit soloist imagine standout convey messiah group rubato--certainly vibrant welcome period receive insight front accuracy day masterpiece numerous sound purpose dosage harnoncourt authentic novel move overlook choir definite revolutionary since forget sentimentality nuance though seem make ensemble well phrasing--which wien musicus extreme stereotyping afford every may tenderness follow

22,576980,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B0002LI11M,Anthony G Pizza,False,"Hand the project in late, lose points off your grade. True in grade school,true now.  In the booklet accompanying The Album No One Thought  Would Ever Come Out, Beach Boy biographer David Leaf sketches what the world within and beyond rock was like when Brian Wilson began his until-now unfinished symphony, ""Smile."" Lyndon Johnson was president, the Beatles released ""Revolver,"" Robert Kennedy was a senator, and the Beach Boys themselves were at a crossroads after what then was a commercially disappointing ""Pet Sounds"" LP among three they'd release in 1966.  But the difference for Brian Wilson between 1966 and 2004 extends beyond the stunning, almost semi-classical music he's finally completed. It's impossible hearing ""Smile"" songs, intricately reassembled from release across late 60s Beach Boy albums, without echoes of his friendly rivalry with Paul McCartney and the Beatles. That rivalry slammed shut with ""Sgt. Pepper"" and the shelving of this music. Despite some fine LPs and one of rock's most reliable concert tours, it started Wilson, his ""messengers"" the Beach Boys, and eventually his family on a downward spiral through addiction and recovery, ""comebacks,"" lawsuits, and death even as they all continued gasping for their audience's and even their own lost youth. Rolling Stone summed it up cruelly in a 1979 album review when saying, ""The Beach Boys are worse than bad...they're irrelevant.""  It's for the Beach Boys as a whole, as well as for Wilson, that ""Smile"" finally saw daylight. Anyone appreciating the Beach Boys beyond ""Endless Summer"" has heard these songs, even assembled their own  ""Smile"" tape picked from ""20/20"" and 1967's  low-cal substitute, ""Smiley Smile.""  Wilson's fine backup band the Wondermints, approximate but cannot match the Beach Boys' vocal blend; you miss the R&B grit in Carl's high falsetto and even Mike Love's much-villified nasal honk.  You'll notice it in ""Smile""'s two most familiar songs.  ""Heroes and Villains"" streams into short, non sequitor solo passages and even a shout ""You're under arrest!"" before restoring its theme. ""Cabinessence"" and ""Good Vibrations,"" the latter the Boys' finest sonic achievement, are little more than note-for-note covers with some changed lyrics and reduced drama.  But ""Surf's Up"" and ""Wonderful"" gain new beauty in flowing, matured harmonies, somewhat slower tempos and instrumental depth (""Wonderful,"" with its gentle harpsichord sound, and ""Wind Chimes"" sound brighter than in ""Smiley Smile""'s druggy renditions).  ""Our Prayer,"" wordless harmonizing shown in the lyric notes as ""ahh-oh-mm,"" is a soaring, achingly beautiful musical sunrise and recalls the Beach Boys at their vocal best. Brian himself maintains most of his own vocal gift, but age and smoking took his highest octave and he strains on some vocals. The bouncy ""Vegetables,"" even without McCartney's bass like on the original, remains fun and playful.  ""Smile"" deserves five stars if only for Brian Wilson's courage to overcome personal and professional demons to finish it, for an loyal audience wondering what his final vision would sound like. But ""Pet Sounds,"" along with the classic singles forming every Beach Boy hits collection you've ever owned, remain his contribution to pop culture and Americana. ""Smile"" was the personal and artistic battle he had to fight and win even as other wars, artistic and otherwise, were lost. Highly recommended, but check out what versions of these songs you may see on the Beach Boys' two-fer CDs (or their box set) and compare performances side by side for a listening and learning experience.",5,"10 2, 2004","Brian's ""Smile"" Far In The Distance But Still Bright",1096675200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},6.0,,"approximate harmony much-villified r&b leaf paul intricately notice theme achingly ever falsetto project flow commercially smile""'s cover loyal bouncy heard fine arrest culture johnson point symphony note mccartney's learn lp strain fun ahh-oh-mm drama star despite rock's shout original reduce youth two-fer slower they'd grit backup smile lyndon david version complete almost across highly miss would booklet sum familiar blend prayer finally band audience reliable release summer sound brighter release experience wilson's saw set two endless without boy fight carl's every gasping may lose recovery review overcome performance americana achievement lyric slam thought rock love's soar hero sonic like vocal wondermints start come recall beatles until-now demon hear within cruelly musical vision kennedy unfinished echo friendly finish one depth show crossroad death new whole compare own win maintains surf's gift vegetable match see solo five stone addiction harpsichord robert side pick album classic downward nasal wind impossible president three vibration war personal he's lyric latter mature vocal hand gain beach true say song harmonize among daylight tour professional brian bad...they're bad anyone contribution eventually bass appreciate wonder artistic box music shut form little audience's grade wilson comeback high beautiful good fine take boys stunning remain sequitor check begin chime school,true wordless shelve pet best concert along beauty wonderful rendition well difference final sketch non age continue pop hit somewhat remain honk smiley accompany sunrise world stream high passage extend senator recommend single deserve gentle druggy octave change low-cal beyond sound rivalry lose rolling lp collection otherwise biographer cannot villain revolver listen pepper mccartney album courage instrumental assemble even battle irrelevant playful sgt restore smoke substitute short disappointing reassemble mike cabinessence lawsuit semi-classical tempos note-for-note cd spiral late messenger family tape"
23,1166926,A1RUP4DFYKG4HZ,B00000592G,WayneB,False,"I bought the original the week it came out. I was waiting, primed and ready to rejoice. But... Well, after classics like their stunning debut, then 'Home', 'Broken Barricades', 'Shine on Brightly' and 'Grand Hotel' (grand indeed!), 'Procol's Ninth' was - like the album title - rather generic and pedestrian. Bad? No! Just, well, lacking edge. I love 'Unquiet Zone' and 'Fools Gold'...and like others. But this band - originally the Paramounts from Southend-on-Sea - had chosen the ace songwriting team of Lieber & Stoller to produce. Why? Well, as the Paramounts they had a minor hit with that duo's classic 'Poison Ivy' (L&S wrote SO many classics!). And as the album 'Liquorice John Death' (Procol recording under another name) revealed, this outfit was steeped in American r&b (thus Gary Brooker's vocal style and the inclusion of 'I Keep Forgetting').

While billed as ""Very Best of..."", this album serves as a greatest hits collection, almost complete.  In an annoyingly frequent pattern though, Rhino produces these compilation CD's of artists' works and then proceedes to leave off just one chart hit.  Here, in a 19-track CD, with ten charted hits, what would have been the difficulty in including Cross' last charting song, ""Charm The Snake""?  The title ""Very Best of..."" itself comes into question in that three of the included tracks from the ""Back of My Mind"" album are remixed versions, previously unissued.  How do three unissued tracks qualify as ""very best""?  Nitpicking aside, this does include all the big hits - the astounding ""Sailing"", the ethereal ""Think of Laura"", the pop jem ""Arthur's Theme"" from the movie and other uncommonly well-constructed pop ditties.  Also on the plus side here appears the licensed-from-Sony swimming theme from the '84 Olympics, ""A Chance For Heaven"".  The remaining tracks are album cuts from Cross' post-charting-era albums of diverging styles.

31,683811,AXH0N2WNS206U,B000MNOXI0,Richard Mayes,False,"It's ironic that Mary Chapin made an often noisy record for her first outing with folk-based Zoe Records.  Her previous label often complained she didn't deliver enough commercial product, now she seems to have over-compensated.  Overall, aside from my concern at the noisy tracks, I'm left with the overriding sense that this album is something of a plateau for MCC.  Lyrically, I think she's as strong as ever, musically perhaps not as much, but Tom Bukovic's noisy electric guitar often spoils this collection. Perhaps as producers Matt Rollings and MCC are at fault here. I think the title track may have suited a more acoustic interpretation, and tracks like ""We're Alright"", with its strange, straining chorus unlike anything MCC has ever done, ""It Must Have Happened"" and ""On With The Song"" continue the rowdy atmosphere.  Then again, ""Twilight"" is at the other end of the scale, and a repetitive bridge ""you and me"" - repeated six times, is not the hallmark of a songwriter of MCC's stature.  ""On And On It Goes"" starts magically both musically and lyrically (""river starts with a drop of rain somewhere in this world/light years shade this arc of sky and sand a precious pearl"") but somehow loses its way without a bridge or chorus, and becomes too wordy and rambling. Even though it is also a bit noisy, ""Your Life Story"" delivers its message better than some of the other songs here - especially in the rousing bridge ""stars to help you find your place, music, hope and amazing grace.""  For me, there are two standout songs here, ""Houston"" and ""Closer and Closer Apart"", the latter being one of the best examples of MCC's writing (""over and over and over again, the world only spins one way/the past is a distant flicker by now, and a lesson for another day""), sung with a mixture of conviction and resignation. But her well-known anti-George W Bush sentiments in ""On With The Song"" translate into something of a rant. ""Leaving Song"", ""Here I Am"" and ""Why Shouldn't We"" are low-key but welcome respites from the sonic overkill. ""Bright Morning Star"" ends the album on a musically rather flat note.  Overall, this is the first MCC album that disappointed me, and I've been listening to her music for the best part of 20 years.

According to Forkel, the Variations were written as a soporific for Count Kaiserling, so it's possible that this turgid and monotonous rendition is more ""authentic"" to the work's original intention. But I doubt it. Bach is nothing if not a master of intricate structure, but any hint of this is lost in Barenboim's excessively slow tempo. The longer 25th Adagio variation should stand out as more serious and meditative than the others, but if they're all played at the same speed, this essential quality is lost.  Not that it should matter, but Barenboim's liner notes are almost incoherent - ""the theme itself is a theme in itself."" I've read that over and over, and am not convinced that it means anything. This performance is so idiosyncratic, the notes should have explained the choices made - we didn't need another explanation of what Bach was trying to accomplish.

Having said that, Jennifer Hudson comes pretty damn close. Though her voice lacks the depth and richness of Holiday's (although I'm guessing she is going to mature immensely as an entertainer), she nonetheless rips through the show's signature tune with gusto - and will leave you mesmerized. Watching her sing this number on screen was riveting. She mirrors Jennifer No. 1 when appropriate and adds enough difference to make it her own. Hudson's other two solos are terrific - perhaps because of far less Holiday baggage. She is absolutely perfect on ""I Am Changing"" and ""One Night Only"" is a smoldering bluesy affair.  Fans of the film will no doubt prefer the Deluxe Edition over the regular soundtrack - the entire film is practically here and like the film, incredibly entertaining. The opening tracks at the Detroit talent show are great. Other highlights include: the bombastic Eddie Murphy (with the Dreams on back-up) raising the roof on ""Steppin' To The Bad Side"". Also, Keith Robinson delivers the goods on his short but pivotal ""Family"" and ""Effie, Sing My Song"". And, the newly written Beyonce solo (""Listen"") is powerful and beautifully sung. It fits smoothly into the film - but she ain't no Hudson.  On the downside: Jamie Foxx is a bit disappointing on what otherwise should be the film's ultimate love song - ""When I First Saw You"". Loretta Devine's dreamy ""I Miss You Old Friend"" is far too short - she sounds superb. And finally the dance remixes are not the late night club anthems they should be. Beyonce's ""One Night Only"" fares better than Hudson's souped up ""And I Am Telling You..."" Lady B will surely be spun at gay boogie rooms across the planet.

54,968256,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00DNJ99CA,Kaya Savas,True,"Atli &Ouml;rvarsson really wowed me with his score for Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. It managed to craft a mythical soundscape yet sound modern and kick serious ass. I mention Hansel & Gretel because it was at the premiere of that film that Atli got hired for The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones. Director Harald Zwart was in attendance and was impressed with Atli's work so much that Atli basically got the job right then and there. Mortal Instruments is a very different score than Hansel & Gretel. Here Atli does indeed craft a beautiful mythological soundscape, but he infuses a sense of wonder and scope into it. There is an edge of mystery and magic behind the music. The score is wonderfully thematic, melodic and ultimately engaging.  The opening theme sets the stage for the wonderful journey that follows. I mentioned crafting a mythology, and the score does indeed do that. The music feels solely part of the world that the movie exists in, and that's important. It gives the listener a grounding quality for the characters in the setting. The music's approach utilizes high-energy melodies and choral arrangements to give it a large scope. The action is also executed in pure &Ouml;rvarsson style. &Ouml;varsson's scores all have this pulsating energy that drives them, and Mortal Instruments continues that. He can build tracks to great effect to give them an epic fantasy scope. The choral work in the score is definitely one of the main draws. It's not as deep and brooding as say Lord Of The Rings, which Shore used to create darkness and impending doom. Here the chorus has enough weight to give it substance yet light enough to keep it ethereal and mystical. The music really ramps up in energy and intensity in the final act, and there are some fantastic action tracks. Electronics are used to give the music the hard modern edge it needs, but we still keep that other worldly mysticism all the way through to the end.  The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones is some of Atli &Ouml;rvarsson's best thematic work and it's a fantastically engaging score. The music is high-energy, but it also packs a lot of that grand fantasy to make the soundscape truly unique. &Ouml;rvarsson's pulsating style works incredibly well here, and the choral arrangements really make a dramatic impact in the music. I've been a huge fan of Atli's music since the beginning of his career, and it's been great to see his sound gain strength over the years. Mortal Instruments is a wonderful example of &Ouml;rvarsson's thematic sensibilities and pulsating action stylings.",4,"10 18, 2013",Some Of &Ouml;rvarsson's Most Thematically Sound Work,1382054400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,give harald mythical hard score wonderfully atli's manage much sensibility magic i've gain work character way career theme zwart movie approach pulsate thematic ring edge arrangement world action job as create execute impressed important modern instrument enough journey open impact engage kick definitely wonder great feel act unique different serious mysticism bone hunter premiere doom deep draw music huge director stage electronics really set solely that's substance one hire part utilize scope pure lot atli quality right epic mystical pack sense beautiful stylings mystery mention give set city mythological large use gretel ouml;varsson's craft truly energy effect fantastically continue light weight attendance melodic music's get exists fantastic brood high-energy ouml;rvarsson's track also fan strength still indeed work see hansel choral basically witch year score sound listener ultimately make main fantasy build need ethereal ouml;rvarsson begin darkness style grand melody since shore impend chorus best incredibly wow yet intensity mortal drive mention infuses behind follow wonderful end soundscape craft ramp worldly well lord mythology say example ground dramatic final keep film

At times, it's a bit like the Stranglers circa 'Rattus Norvegicus' only without the leering, unsubtle sexism. It's clattering trad boogie with haunting keyboard flourishes.

70,197240,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B000002KC0,Anthony Nasti,False,"Frank Sinatra stunned the music world in June 1971 when he announced his retirement from the music world after nearly 40 years at the top of the entertainment world. His legions of fans were left devastated, and spent the next two years hoping and praying that Frank would recant the decision.  Fortunately, those hopes and prayers came into fruition. By early 1973, Frank had entered the studio to work on a new album. Teamed up with frequent collaborators Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa and a fresh batch of contemporary material, Frank unleashed the aptly titled ""Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back."" The result is one of his most overlooked albums as well as his most singularly entertaining.  Despite the triumphant nature of the album's title, the album's material creates quite the contradiction, the album in many ways is more in line with the Saloon Song albums of the 1950s' rather than a celebration of getting back to what you love best. The album's atmosphere, very slow, moody and string driven, definitely give off that dreary, ""Here's That Rainy Day"" - type vibe, even if some of the songs aren't necessarily sad. Despite this, the album succeeds in letting the world knew Frank was still the best pop singer around.  The album begins with the bare, haunting muted horn intro of Joe Raposo's beautiful ""You Will Be My Music,"" and it's instantly obvious that Ol' Blue Eyes is indeed back: here's Frank punching out a beautifully written piece of music, digging into the very soul of the song, clinging to each phrase like it's his last breath, with a majestic Gordon Jenkins arrangements adding support. This is one of my absolute favorite Frank recordings.  Next comes the mellow and romantic ""You're So Right (For What's Wrong In My Life)."" One of Frank's greatest strengths was taking a second rate composition and turning it into a work of art, and this song is no exception. The song itself is decidely pedestrian (lyrics like ""You Made My World A Shangri-La"" is typical 1970s' pretentious at its finest), but Frank's vocal is so effective and moving that you forget the less commendable aspects of the song.  The bittersweet ""Winners"" follows. Once again, it's a lightweight composition, but once again Frank's second to none singing and interpretive skills elevate to first rate status.  Kris Krosteferson's melancholy ""Nobody Wins"" follows, and is a fine piece of 1970s' soft rock with a somber, passionate reading by The Master with an equally sparse yet wonderfully atmospheric arrangement.  Next comes the album's most recognizable cut, one of the most beautiful songs ever written and one that Frank was destined to sing. Stephen Sondheim's ""Send In The Clowns"" is given a stunning rendition by Frank, bristling with pathos and raising neck hairs as Frank slowly moves from each verse to the next. The result is a breathtaking musical experience. Though it doesn't hold the grandiose intensity of, say, Frank's 1963 reading of ""Ol' Man River,"" but the passion and soul is just the same. Gordon Jenkins' arrangement adds to the beauty of the recording.  ""Dream Away"" at his most tender and quiet. It's a lovely song with a wonderfully elegant, dreamy arrangement and Frank sounds very relaxed and soulful on this number. One of my faves for sure.  Next comes the album's most famous tune and an anthem in vein of ""My Way"" (oddly enough, Paul Anka wrote both tunes). ""Let Me Try Again"" is a powerful ballad in which Frank apologizes to his fans for leaving them and begs for them to forgive his absence and let them reenter the hearts that he had a place in for nearly 40 years. Frank's vocal on this song is his strongest performance on the album, ascending to the operatic peaks that made ""Sinatra & Strings"" and ""The Concert Sinatra"" such powerful pieces.  The reflective ""There Used To Be A Ballpark"" is another well known cut from this album. Frank really digs into this cut, punching out notes and eloquently phrasing each line. The arrangement is quite lovely and evocative (listen to the strings and horns on when Frank sings ""And the fireworks exploding and a great big Fourth July.""  The album ends on a low note with the overly bombastic ""Noah."" Obviously inspireed by Noah's Ark - hey, I'm a religious guy, I know my stuff - it's an overly corny gospel tune with an annoying chorus. An unfortunate end to an otherwise top notch return.  ""Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back"" falls just short of being a a masterpiece, but is one of Frank's finest latter day efforts and is worth getting for sure.",5,"01 24, 2008","""When All The Songs Are Out Of Tune, And All The Rhymes Ring So Untrue....""",1201132800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},5.0,,contradiction paul performance aptly romantic come ever powerful slow bittersweet arrangement nobody fine composition try saloon mellow last hope favorite many decidely sure absolute rainy atmospheric note song creates inspire fortunately verse write really despite ballpark annoy right river cut let type reflective july album's dreary singer stuff neck would costa write pretentious raposo's lightweight rendition sinatra explode effective fresh experience retirement quiet gordon forget two bombastic somber elegant bare follow entertain return relaxed note guy string give know dreamy send away lyric notch soul wonderfully breathtaking breath rock none record fruition like winner way take moody peak listen hold title spent passion sings kris definitely musical raise vein enter anthem melancholy elevate intro obvious one instantly beg love new title make string material haunt worth first dig turn phrase ascend add top still stephen year noah albums collaborator jenkins status hairs yet intensity though operatic celebration piece give begin reenter rather support phrase joe fall ballad second latter record devastate tune contemporary vocal legion work sing decision driven song know recant apologizes next enough big clown leave equally june gospel fan obviously less music leave singularly unfortunate nearly win back pray triumphant succeed place wrong beautiful low vibe fine let add soulful stun use team come ol early result dream what's faves entertainment prayer forgive horn end indeed art masterpiece tender man corny overlook move hop ark piece i'm best move concert beauty typical life recognizable announce evocative knew well overly say another arrangement cling majestic sad sparse master read pop lovely quite destined way stun pedestrian pathos world passionate soft absence nature noah's great eye krosteferson's unleashed grandiose fourth religious line great tune rate here's anka strength atmosphere slowly frank's exception sound necessarily eloquently sing punch mute firework otherwise number skill studio effort frequent dig album interpretive blue hey batch even horn day commendable aspect short shangri-la around chorus heart end frank famous oddly sondheim's get bristle strong beautifully

This is a wonderful opportunity  to hear Ellington's versatility: some dissonance and minimization, and a  whole lot of Ellington swing.  Mingus, as usual, is a powerhouse  throughout, with his great bowing bass and creative lines and pairing  generating energy and interest.  The (few) bass solos are entirely  engaging.  As noted elsewhere, Mingus seems almost to challenge Ellington  on some numbers, threatening to take over with his inspired bass. But  Ellington more than meets the challenge with his own aggressive stylings. Max Roach is probably my favorite drummer and he just shines here (as he  does on his collaborations with Clifford Brown).  A dazzling display of  popping sounds, syncopation, splashy cymbals, and on-the-money drum rolls;  he creates a symphony of percussion.

74,679225,A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B000KN7BJA,Rebecca*rhapsodyinblue*,False,"""It wasn't Monet, it was France; It's not what we say But the dance we're in; There lies the mysterious glue In this set of songs I sing to you"" ~ Art Garfunkel ~  As someone who grew up with the standards from my late parents' collection playing over and over at our musical household as sung by Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Cole, Vaughan, Martin, Bennett, Clooney, Day, London, Stafford, among many others, I totally welcome and embrace new interpretations by contemporary artists done in the most beautiful recordings with splendid vocals and sublime arrangements. This album fits that description to a T.  So it's only natural for me to love this ""comeback album"" of timeless standards by Art Garfunkel, ""Some Enchanted Evening."" And these are some great reasons.  Firstly, I have admired the music of Simon and Garfunkel in the past - ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""Mrs. Robinson,"" to mention a few. When the duo went separate ways, I remained a fan of Art Garfunkel having loved some of his hit songs such as ""Disney Girls,"" ""I Only Have Eyes For You,"" ""Since I Don't Have You,"" ""It's All In The Game"" and ""Crying In The Rain,"" an awesome duet with another talented singer/guitarist/songwriter James Taylor.  Secondly, how can I not love the songs in the repertoire when these are everlasting favorites of mine? These are the most appealing works of brilliant tunesmiths and lyricists such as George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II, Johnny Mercer, among others. Many thanks Mr. Garfunkel and everyone involved in this incredibly beautiful album of classic standards with such contemporary approach. Let there be a follow-up album of this kind. (Paging Richard Perry and Lauren Wild!).  Thirdly, with its sublimely remarkable arrangements and instrumentations from the finest musicians in the recording scene, the likes of Steve Gadd (drums), Dean Parks, Randy Kerber, Lee Thornburg, Bobby Ginsberg and Frank Simes (guitars), Mike Thompson and Alex Navarro (piano and keyboards), Bob Glaub (synth strings), Nick Sample (bass), Doug Webb (clarinet and flute), Chris Smith (harmonica), Maia Sharp (sax), Michael Montilla (percussion) as well as Mr. Garfunkel's perfect-in-every-way interpretations, this album will truly win not only your ears but also your heart. Mr. Garfunkel has not lost the luster of his voice with the passage of time. The gorgeousness of this album flows freely and smoothly from the first track ""I Remember You"" to the last ""If I Loved You"" making each rendition a showcase of his enchanting and heartwarming vocal style. ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" is stunning. ""Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars"" is absolutely beautiful. ""What'll I Do?"" is poignant and moving. ""I'm Glad There Is You"" is so charming. ""It Could Happen To You"" is inspiring. ""Let's Fall In Love"" is so lovable. ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"" is outstanding. ""Life Is But A Dream"" is pensive and features producer Richard Perry on bass vocals. And the title track ""Some Enchanted Evening"" is enthralling. I've never heard this ditty sang in a totally different rhythm. It's so beautiful!  Lastly, it's an enchantingly perfect addition to your collection of ageless standards.  So deserving of *****TEN STARS*****rating! With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening pleasure always and forever.

Better to buy either the new Orfeo label edition, which is good but three times the price, or the bargain Membran set (available on Amazon UK) which is a good, clean transfer with minimal distortion. This performance will never be a sonic extravaganza in whatever issue you acquire it, and you have to endure some very annoying, persistent coughers who belie the reputation for attentiveness enjoyed by Bayreuth audiences, but its limitations are well worth accepting in return for an incandescent assumption of their roles by the two great principal singers in top form. There is something peculiarly immediate and vibrant about Modl's assumption of the role of Isolde which puts the magisterial but bland Flagstad in the shade and even outdoes Nilsson in the famous live Bohm performance. She has a Callas-like manner of getting to the heart of the role by a specially intelligent inflection of the text and affecting use of her lower register combined with some thrilling (if slightly ""scooped"") top notes. Vinay's baritonal tenor is both heroic and tender; the exchange between the lovers just after their discovery in flagrante by the king is particularly moving. Ludwig Weber is past his best and a bit wobbly, but knows how to wring the heart and Hotter, typically woofy and heavy on the vibrato, nonetheless creates a vivid character in his Kurwenal. Despite the limited sound you can hear how Karajan caresses the music without dragging it out or distorting the pacing of the work; he really is good here, free of the later affectations and mannerisms. Uhde turns in another typically incisive vignette as the vicious, obsessive Melot. Malaniuk is just average as Brangane but sings strongly and expressively where it counts in her offstage warnings during the great love duet. This recording takes its place alongside my other favourite ""Tristans"": the old Reiner/Beecham with Flagstad and Melchior (the latter still unbeatable), the later Furtwangler, the Bohm DG live, the Knappertsbusch set with Treptow and Braun and the last and latest Pappano, in lovely sound and preserving a performance of lieder-like intensity and burnished tone by Domingo.",3,"09 11, 2006",A great performance but ....,1157932800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},5.0,,obsessive latter vibrato record thrill vicious treptow limitation bayreuth edition lovely use wring performance drag work manner sonic register flagrante dg average reputation turn character furtwangler distort magisterial time melchior audience last puts strongly alongside sings poor isolde malaniuk principal heroic something great slightly different later endure note clean preserve inflection immediate kurwenal accepting well create role discovery singer music bargain see affect weber baritonal hotter really pappano lieder-like incisive combine despite love role new issue coughers distortion annoy whatever place nilsson incandescent favourite knappertsbusch live free good attentiveness assumption limit woofy worth amazon transfer orfeo price bit callas-like scoop braun mannerism expressively bland domingo acquire heart various vinay's particularly top ludwig wobbly hear tenor buy burnish modl's uk belie still vivid outdoes lover vignette late vibrant even count form flagstad typically duet reiner/beecham tender tristan sound caress affectation brangane unbeatable offstage either never text exchange pacing warning enjoy best set move two melot intensity old know membran persistent without shade take bohm incarnation peculiarly return specially karajan extravaganza famous heavy nonetheless label well available past tone get label three another minimal king lower intelligent uhde

Still, ""Rust in Peace"" is one of my all time favorite albums so when I heard of this new all-star album he was putting out I became very interested.  The fact that David Davidson (Revocation) and Alexi Laiho (Children of Bodom) were both contributing had me sold from the start.  The early release tracks started showing up on YouTube so I figured I'd give them a listen.  I was impressed!  I'm always a little hesitant when listening to guitar player solo albums, as then tend to sacrifice song writing and rhythm for wanking, but MF has found a good balance.  I initially listened to ""Inferno"" and ""Steroidhead"" and liked both.  And then I found ""Meat Hook"" and was totally blown away.  After I got past the initial ""WTF?!"" reaction when the saxophone kicked in, the song really took off.  I especially love the change at the 1:15 mark.  It's like MF soloing over the E Street Band while standing on a table in the middle of Cheers.  After that the song totally shreads.  Seriously, frickin' brilliant.  So finally the song ""Sociopaths"" featuring David Davidson was released so I jumped on it.  Awesome.  DD has mentioned in articles how influenced he was by Marty and it shows when you hear the two of them together.  The song has some strong Revocation influence in it, as one would expect, but I was very surprised how dynamic the collaboration was.  I wasn't at first a fan of the chorus parts, but after a few listens they really grew on me.  They add variation to the song which really helps emphasize other parts.  I feel like they actually make the song feel heavier simply by adding contrast.  Production on this album is also quite good.  I find some of the editing a little heavy handed in places, such as pauses coming to unnaturally abrupt stops, but otherwise okay.  That's really my only nitpick on the whole album.  Well, except for ""I Can't Relax"".  I don't really care for that song.  I won't skip it, but it simply doesn't grab my attention like the other tracks.  So yeah, it's a great album.

108,390844,A2WSNLL4SK7Q9A,B00002MZ4W,James Tutwiler,False,"This album will be a dud salewise for young Fiona Apple. Perhaps, we will see one more outing from this gifted songwriter and then it will be off to ""dropped from the label"" land.  Why? Because Apple is apparantly  so dysfunctional she refuses to compromise her artistic muse for the sake  of another ""Criminal"" hit.  This new album is so good it's  possible she could have very well made the last great album of the  twentieth century. Not unlike Kurt Cobain, who was also able to seamlessly  meld artistic credibility with pop sensibility, Fiona Apple has had to  resort to unnecessary fashionable representations (i.e. being a poster  child for deer in the headlights waifs across the world) to gain and  maintain her immediate popularity.  Had she always been presented strictly  for her talent, there's a chance this record would have been viewed as far  more accessible.  Yet because of her past notoriety, Apple is obviously  forced into appealing to her young fans in order to sell millions of  records, which isn't going to happen here. Most telling is her recent rants  against such phony female singers as Christine Arguille and Britney Spears.  The fact that Apple thrusts her name in comparison is indicative of the  dilemma she is facing. Unfortunately for this still emerging talent, the  respect due her is eluded while her true counterparts P.J. Harvey and Ana  DiFranco garner underground accolades that seemingly guarantee them an  almost Iggy Pop immortality.  This record is curiously, if not purposely,  devoid of top 40 sounds. Nor is it youth oriented.  This is simply a great  record.  Apple plays piano in almost a Jerry Lee Lewis fashion, betraying  an obvious American influence and talent that would easily intimidate  Canadian counterpart Tori Amos.  Combined with a great production team,  Apple brings Janis Joplin into the 21st century, reflecting an honesty and  emotional breadth sorely missing from popular music today. One can only  hope that young and intense talents such as Fiona Apple are nurtured and  encouraged, despite any perception of their future profitablilty for the  corporations they record for. Otherwise, great records like this new one  from Apple may never be heard again.

112,207966,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000002KP3,Tim Brough,True,"Marc Bolan was an older man trapped in a younger man's brain. In his world, unicorns and faeries still ran amok, bongos were still pretty cool and twee spacey poetry made for good lyrics. But something happened by the time he expanded his band into a full unit and set forward with ""Electric Warrior."" Bolan discovered the magic three  chord boogie and blues and found out that sleazy grooves were so much more fun that medieval trippiness.  Which made ""Electric Warrior"" arguably the first brilliant glam album. While David Bowie, producer Tony Visconti and Bolan were pals, it was another year before Bowie delivered ""Ziggy Stardust"" to the world and really shored up the UK Glam scene. ""Electric Warrior"" managed transatlantic success, bringing a taste of Bolan-mania to this continent via ""Bang a Gong (Get It On)"" and that single's stride to the US Top Ten. Yet, despite the ""Electric"" part of the title, Bolan still showed remarkable restraint. Only in the final ""Rip Off"" does the band go for some floorboard shaking.  But the real winners here, from ""Bang a Gong"" to the Chuck Berry inspired ""Jeepester"" and the handicapping blues of ""Lean Woman Blues"" rock in their own sublime way. Bolan was still enthralled by his hippy-dippy days, but it seemed now confined only to the lyrics (sample from ""Planet Queen"": ""Flying saucer take me away, give me your daughter,"" or the bulk of the still sultry ""Bang a Gong."" It made its peace with folk, rock and shot-gun marriage to bubblegum, and you'll hear traces of everyone from Bowie to Mott to Slade (hey, if ""Hot Love"" and ""Bang a Gong"" aren't godfathers to ""Cum On Feel The Noise,"" you tell me what is) across this album.  I'd also advise to find the expanded Rhino version that includes ""Hot Love"" as a bonus track and seven other bonus tracks, including an acoustic run through of ""Planet Queen,"" and ""Raw Ramp,"" a bonus single and a cool T Rex Electric Warrior interview.

In a strange way, I found this new release to be a logical progression from ""Rainy Day Music"", the Jayhawks' swan song and best CD. When I first listened to this CD, the first thing I referenced (as one poster has already astutely noted) was ""If I could Only Remember My Name"" by David Crosby from 1971. This CD has a very intimate, very organic feel to it. It is very L.A./Laurel Canyon/Early 70's in terms of being creatively open, yet very accessible. The arrangements are scaled down, but you can still hear the great pop, rock and americana sensibilities that Louris has always had. You can tell that this music is coming from a very creative focus as opposed to pandering to demographic or genre in terms of entertainment value. That's not to say that Louris has ever pandered to an audience for purposes of pure entertainment, and he is certainly a skilled and seasoned live performer. However, this is a real step forward for him in terms of that this just might be the first time he has completely captured his muse on record (CD) in the way that he has always wanted to.

The culmination point in that was in the powerful evocotive Missing(The original parent album version, not the club version). After that EBTG morphed into a more club house dance group yet maintaining all of the personality that they had in the beginning. It started with the driving house beats of the remix of Missing then with excellent Walking Wounded and continues with their most recent release Tempermental which I must say was a breath of fresh air during 1999, one of the worst years for music(In my honest opinion). Tempermental is an album to enjoy when driving through the city in the middle of a lonely night. Many emotions stir throughout this CD. Tracies voice sounds better than ever on here. The arrangements are well crafted, moody, and rich with diversity  and depth.  This CD changed the way I looked at modern club dance music. I thought dance music was pretty much done but the Future Of The Future proved me wrong.

They  make the music the fuels the fire in their souls and it's completely evident on all of their albums, but especially so on The Sound of Madness.

With the recording sessions taking place in Fez, Morocco, Dublin, Ireland and London, England, U2's thirteenth studio album No Line On The Horizon is a solid set of songs that are less commercially-oriented, but promises to be a huge masterpiece in the vein of Achtung Baby! or more commercial albums like Zooropa, POP and All That You Can Leave Behind. The band tries to go back to the 1990's electronic rock experiment that rendered some good results. For that matter, the guys teamed up, once again, with Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno and Steve Lillywhite, who have been responsible for U2's success in the mid-to-late 1980's and the 1990's. The controversial issue here, however, is that most U2 fans consider it a masterpiece, while others label it a huge disappointment like its predecessor How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, especially when they compare the promotional single Get On Your Boots with other stuff  from HTDAAB, such as Vertigo or Miracle Drug. Get On Your Boots got puzzled most of the band's fan base, because they did not know what to expect. IMO, Boots is a good song, but not enough to be considered a huge hit or classic. There are other choices that have a tremendous potential like, for instance, No Line On The Horizon, Magnificent, Moment of Surrender, Unknown Caller  and I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight, which are easily classic U2 sounding. The remaining tracks: Stand Up Comedy, FEZ-Being Born, White As Snow, Breathe and Cedars of Lebanon are in between the sound of Zooropa and POP, mixed up  with a little of  HTDAAB. So, the result on the second half is a mixed-bag. As for the band's performance, I must say that Bono is still in great shape for his age-vocally speaking, of course, and so is The Edge, whose guitar work is the most solid of all. Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton keep the same good quality performance, being them assisted by Lanois and Eno on the keyboards.

The album is however very entertaining and I can play it through for the most part, without too much skipping except when I got to tracks 13 to 17 - too many skits.  My favorite tracks are:  4. All Falls Down - hot single; good message about people who are lost in school etc. Syleena Johnson is featured and she sounds great.  6. Spaceship - I love this song - it's about working someplace you hate. Consequence & GLC are featured and their rhymes are tight.  7. Jesus Walks - hot single with some good messages.  8. Never let me down - love it - the beat is sick - the singing is beautiful - JayZ's flow is outstanding on this.  9. Get em high featuring Common and Talib Kweli - good beat. Common and Talib Kweli's raps are both on point.  18. Two Words - nice beat; good raps by Mos Def and Freeway. The Harlem Boys Choir sounds good.  19. Through the Wire - hot single.  21. Last Call - long outro but it has a nice beat and tells the story of how he became a rapper.  Kanye has an annoying personality and so it shows on the worse tracks. The worse tracks are:  3. Graduation Day - silly, pointless interlude;  11. The new workout plan - this is a joke - it's about giving head as a workout;  13. Breathe in breathe out - another head giving song;  14. School Spirit Skit 1 - annoying interlude;  15. School Spirit - song about nothing;  16. School Spirit Skit 2 - annoying anti-education interlude;  17. Lil Jimmy Skit - another annoying anti-education interlude;  His anti-degree interludes are supremely annoying. Doesn't he realize that not everyone can end up in the arts, whether it's being a professional dancer, singer, producer, actor or artist?

151,554600,AO2AQRPPSTABB,B00011CYKM,J.Park,True,"The Dead acknowledge the imminent closing of the decrepit Winterland venue with this five-hour New Years Eve musical extravaganza, which has been thoughtfully and carefully preserved in a well-packaged four CD set.  The sound quality is flawless, having been translated in HDCD format, and boasts crisp treble and deep, rich bass.  Everybody is in top form, and what I like to refer to as the nucleus of Jerry, Phil, Mickey, and Bill interact on such a sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic level, that it appears that they can read one another's minds.  In fact, even the photographs in the CD booklet attest to the fact that they clearly enjoyed playing together.  The set starts off on CD 1 with a very nice Sugar Magnolia>Scarlet Begonias>Fire on the Mountain and then the band cheerily chugs through a number of concert favorites and a few other pieces from the (at the time) recently released Shakedown Street.  As things progress, the band stretches out and the jams become really interesting, with the virtuosic interplay between Jerry and Phil driving it all along.  The highlight for me is the 25 minute Terrapin Station>Playing in the Band on CD 2.  On Playing in the Band in particular, Jerry unleashes a rapid fire torrent of notes on his guitar that is so dense that it completely surrounds the listener like a heavy rain. Things get even looser and a bit more raw on CD 4 with the Dark Star>The Other One>Dark Star>Wharf Rat>St. Stephen jam.  At points in this lengthy workout, Phil's bass playing gets very loud and aggressive and oh, does it sound great! The Closing of Winterland has captured the ecstatic and celebratory mood of the event so effectively that it is readily conveyed to people like me who were not even there (I was suffering through a New England winter).

162,1164321,A1L1VZ854S2FB2,B00000479H,RH,True,"Once again, Stan Getz have greatly impressed listeners and the critics alike with another world class live album that became another important blockbuster hit for ""The Sound"".  Recorded live at London's Ronnie Scott's and released to critical acclaim in 1971, Dynasty showcases a delightful high octane mixture of striking notes, fresh original compositions, swinging melodies, world class musicianship and a crescendo beat.  With Belgian guitarist Rene Thomas, French jazz organist Eddie Louise and French jazz/ classical drummer Bernard Lugat in his quartet, Getz and the three band members decide not to have standards on the live album (except for one that was added on it) and roughly have only few long towering compositions, which were exclusively well featured by this diverse quartet line-up. Sporadically recorded during three days from their three week engagement, the mesmerizing track set features an array of classic original hits like the light and breezy opening track Dum Dum Dum, where it is it proceded by Ballad For Leo, Theme For Emmanuelle, Our Kind Of Sabi, the sweet ballad Mona (composed by master trombonist Albert Mengelsdorff as the organ weaves through with a slow rhythm) and Ballade For My Dad.  Clocking in at just 98 minutes and documented well by producer George Martin, Ronnie Scott--the saxophonist and proud owner of Ronnie Scott's, also sits in on some of the live club dates alongside Getz, and Louise showcases the swelling organ solos in foundation form.  Other classic tracks round out the live recording with full house fashion, which the rest include the lone standard Invitation, the easy-going Song For Martine, the funky blues shuffle `road song' title track, and it's followed their grand finale take on Benny Golson's I Remember Clifford (one of the two standards in the set).  Dynasty is a highly lauded masterpiece that is done live from top to bottom, which rank as one of Getz' greatest and most honoured live albums.  I may have to highly recommend this great live masterpiece to any jazz fan or any admirer of Stan Getz which will remain as timeless and captivating as ever for the ages.

The music of the Dead is not always immediate, like some radio-friendly pop single. The music of the dead sometimes requires a trained ear to appreciate; I myself was not at first enamored with much of their work, but with time it really grew on me. That is why I would not start here - Europe '72 has a sound that will ""warm you up"" to the band better. And to the folks calling the music ""boring"" and ""lacking focus"" - the Dead are not Umphree's Mcgee or some other modern ""jam band"" for the A.D.D. kids (no personal offense to people with that condition) who have short attention spans - you need take the time to actually sit down and listen to really appreciate this band. Sorry for the defensive rant, on to the show...  Despite being a Two-discer, This is another one of my favorite picks. I think dick's original intention was not to present complete shows, which in some cases where there are merely highlights, I think is fine. Still, besides Dick's Picks 28, this is the best '73 pick out there imo.  Disc One: Perhaps a little better than disc two, opening with a classic and stunning Here Comes Sunshine that is easily a top-five version. I only wish they hadn't stopped playing this song after early '74 - it had a lot of potential as a beautiful jam vehicle, much in the same way as the bird songs of '72/'73. Next comes excellent versions of Big River, Big Railroad blues, and a nice Weather report, as well as a interesting Half-Step that instead of ending in the ""up the rio-grande"" coda, has a mellow outtro jam before fading out. The disc ends with a very unique and long Playing in the Band that is one of the best of the DP series.  Disc Two: Starts out very strong with excellent versions of He's Gone and Truckin' - some of my favorites in the series- where Garcia really shines as a soloist. he was never better than he was in '73, and we get even more proof of this with the somewhat rare Nobody's Fault But Mine where he shows off his great blues chops; this version here is another personal favorite.

172,724193,A8JFL6FA9A32P,B000ZPPS0W,Garage Rat,True,5 stars for Dave but 0 for album quality as it took 3 times sending it back and then it was only because I got 1 playable record from 2 different ones to make up a full album. These are still not A+ but the others were so warped they were unplayable. Seriously ridiculously flimsy production. The deal with Vinyl now is you have to buy 180 gram + weight or they are thinner than paper and crap. That also means the cost is way more now also. I am not a freak about this either as plenty of my older albums are not 180 grams but are much sturdier and produced better by far.

As the movie for which it was used follows the life of, as stated in the album's leaflet, ""A simple man's journey through complicated times"", this soundtrack covers American songs going from the fifties (Hound Dog, Rebel Rouser) till  1980 (On the Road Again, Against the Wind). Therefore, listening to this album is almost like getting to live or relive those time periods, along with the incidents that have had a major impact on our lives and our world. As such, the nostalgia in this soundtrack is as heart-wrenching as the movie it was made for.  Though I have loved all of the music tracks, I'd say my favorites are ""Blowin in the Wind"", ""I Can't Help Myself"", ""What the World Needs Now is Love"", ""Stoned Love"", ""Mrs. Robinson"" and ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"". As for the music composed by Alan Silvestri, the producers of this album also offer us the ""Forrest Gump Suite"" as a final treat. However I still wish they could have included the song ""Freebird"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, which was used for that powerful scene when Jenny (played by Robin Wright) is attempting a suicide by jumping off from a balcony. I always wonder why they didn't get to put that track. Maybe they had contractual reasons, or maybe they didn't had any more space to put the song on the album? Who knows? Then again, I still wish that they could put that song in a future edition.

187,746463,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B000WM72KC,Ben,False,"Over seven years in the making, Angel Down isn't necessarily what one might expect from Sebastian Bach. It's got a number of mid-tempo songs with chugging riffs and a couple of ballads, but also included is a slew of aggressive metal tracks. Bach also brings some harsher vocals to the table that occasionally border on screaming, but they fit perfectly over the brutal riffs of Metal Mike Chlasciak's Jackson. Also present on Angel Down are Johnny Chromatic (guitar), the great Steve Digiorgio (bass), Bobby Jarzombek (drums), and underrated producer Roy Z, who also co-wrote a number of the songs on the album.  While unexpected, the heavier style of Angel Down definitely comes as a welcome change to Bach's classic style, though we get plenty of that on the album as well. ""Angel Down,"" the title track and my personal favorite, opens this album with an all out assault of killer riffs and screeching vocals. The catchy, Skid Row-esque ""You Don't Understand"" keeps things rolling and features Bach's signature clean, melodic vocals. The next three tracks, a cover of Aerosmith's ""Back in the Saddle,"" ""Love is a Bitchslap,"" and ""Stuck Inside"" all feature Axl Rose as a guest vocalist. Though I was apprehensive about Rose's presence on the album (I've never been a fan), he sounds very good alongside Bach. All three songs are well done but remain somewhat predictable.  Next up are ""American Metalhead"" and ""Negative Light,"" two powerful tracks showcasing Bach's heavier side. ""Live and Die,"" another favorite of mine, contains one of Bach's best vocals on the album while still retaining all of the heaviness present in its two predecessors. Following this entente of ominous tracks is ""By Your Side,"" a classic Bach ballad that's every bit as strong as classic Skid Row tunes such as ""I Remember You."" Bach stirs things up again on ""Our Love Is a Lie,"" a fast-paced track endowed with one of the catchiest choruses on the album.  The next two tracks, ""Take You Down With Me"" and ""Stabbin' Daggers,"" are the weakest two on the album, but each is still solid. ""Take You Down With Me"" has some memorable lyrics, and ""Stabbin' Daggers"" is one of the catchiest songs on the album. Next is ""You Bring Me Down,"" another of my personal favorites. With its menacing opening riff and chugging guitars behind the verse, not to mention the angry lyrics, this one is stuck in my head often. The closer, ""Falling Into You"" is another standard Bach ballad with what sounds like a harpsichord in the background. It isn't one of my favorites, but it ends the album effectively.  Angel Down is solid all the way through and includes numerous standouts; I was able to get into every song without too much trouble. Bach really shows his diversity on this record, and I applaud him for releasing his metal vocals upon the world. Skid Row fans, forget those guys.

They released a promising self-titled debut album in 2012, and almost to the day 2 years later now comes the bands anticipated second studio album.  Worship The Sun (14 tracks; 40 min.)  continues in the same vein of the debut album, with the same simple sounds which are in fact a lot more complex/layered than you think. The album opens with the short De Vida Voz and we are off on a rollicking good time. Had It All is one of my favorites on here, providing good vibes all around. The production sounds a bit more lush/richer than it was on the debut album, and that only adds to the enjoyment of course. The songs are short, make their musical point, and move on. Not a second is wasted, and nothing lingers on for the sake of just lingering.

Basically,just all around great '70's British hard rocking/glam rock,the WAY it should be.

Ethereal guitars drenched in reverb and delay bring out addictive and soothing melodies that work to put you into a peaceful, almost trance-like state. The drumming is extremely understated - the rhythms change, the dynamics shift, and the beats transform, but they do it ever so slowly and with such subtlety that it all sounds like one extended, hypnotic trip. At the same time, the drums are very intricate and technically competent... listen to this stuff through headphones and you start to really notice the magic behind the kit. The bass playing isn't extravagant, but it provides a solid foundation and has it's exceptional moments here and there. Lastly, this album features extensive use of the vibraphone... which serves to give the music a very light, airy, and somewhat dream-like sound.  It's also perfect travel music.

208,311241,A2IK9YLARCZ9YG,B0000062HU,Bud Sturguess,False,"Prompted by the ecstatic success of their 1996 reunion album ""Trial By Fire,"" Journey issued ""Greatest Hits Live,"" a startling document of their domination of the 1980s touring grounds. Despite the title, this is definitely not a mere re-release of hits, presented live in an empty manner of sweetening the deal. And though most of the tracks here were indeed hits, Journey soldiers through a fine canon of work with an explosive energy that challenges the original versions. Despite some re-mixing by Kevin Shirley (who produced ""Trial By Fire""), ""Greatest Hits Live"" possesses a truly live feel due to the fact that no overdubs were included. Culled from 1981 and 83 performances in Tokyo, Oklahoma, and Texas, Journey triumphs with the enduring and well-chosen introduction 'Don't Stop Believin,' and brilliantly shifts tempos and strengths on tracks like 'Lights,' 'Send Her My Love,' and 'Still They Ride.' 'Wheel in the Sky' was a great choice to end concerts with, as the subject of carnival life applies to a life of a touring rock band. The output of vocalist Steve Perry, guitarist Neal Schon, and keyboardist Jonathan Cain shine bright, but it's also worth noting that the rhythm section of Ross Valory and Steve Smith (bass and drums, respectively) are particularly worth mentioning, as the recording techniques bring justice to the their tight and energetic rhythms. Journey was one of the biggest bands of the 1980s, despite the critical association with the dreaded ""80s pop"" sound.

But wanting to hear some more Warrant then what I already had, I got a few more of there albums I didn't have.  After hearing those absolute stink-bomb albums they released, Ultraphobic and Belly To Belly, I figured they had screwed up completly and where going to perform these re-done songs in a grundge/alternative way.  Thats not the case tho!  I guess Warrant realised that changing direction to keep up with the trends is a stupid idea, and they realised that they are a hard rock band. They said after the second album (cherry pie) that they wanted to be a heavier sounding band, but the grundge and alternative direction was a stupid move.  Now they realise they're a hard rock band and they can play hard rock a little heavier, and so that's what they have done on these re-recordings. Song's like Cherry Pie and Down Boy's sound pretty much the same, just in a harder way then the the pop-metal way they had before. Some song's I liked the new version of like ""Heaven"", ""Uncle Toms Cabin"" and ""I saw Red"" ... sure, I preffer the originals to all of these songs, but they sound OK in there new form.  Some song's I didn't like the new rework on, especialy 32 pennis. I don't know what the hell they where thinking at the end of it, but it changes riff about 100 times for no reason and just doesnt fit together. I dunno, maybe Warrant where so sick of that song they decided to trash it or something?  The new song's they wrote are pretty good. There soooooooo much better then the Ultraphobic/Belly to Bell s###.  - Jones' - I'm not sure about that one, it's kinda catchy but didn't really make that much sense to me. I'd have to listen to it more to get a better opinion.  - Hollywood So Far, So Good - It's OK, same as the first one, it needs a few listens to, but it's decent.  - Bad Tattoo -  I like, i can relate to it.  - Southern Comfort - I think this is the best song they have written in years. I THINK it's about a hooker who doesnt like what she does, but she does it for the money and the booze helps her day to day...

238,604743,AC4Z26E60FBEM,B00091SMQE,Fr. Charles Erlandson,False,"It's hard for me to write about ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" without getting nostalgic or emotional.  Like many, I was first introduced to the Blues Magoos by the first Nuggets collection, which I stumbled upon in 1980.  I grew up in the 60s and 70s but had never heard of the Blues Magoos until I bought ""Nuggets,"" the single event that probably had more influence on my musical tastes than any other single event.  Before ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" I was content to listen to the Beatles, the Byrds, and Paul Revere and the Raiders.  But when I first listened to ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" I felt as if somehow I had been cheated for years, not knowing that such music existed!  Something about the early garage-psychedelic music seems to be hardwired into my soul: it's as if I were created to listen to guys like the Blues Magoos.  What amazes me most about ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" is how early it is for psychedelic music.  To use the name ""Psychedelic"" in the title of an album must have seemed incredibly prescient in early 1966.  I don't believe that the Magoos get enough credit for being there first in a number of ways.  It wasn't just their music, which I'll get to in a second.  Their hair was even longer than the Beatles or other bands, and they had these amazing glowing suits.  They must have seemed to some like the future of rock and roll, or at least very hip for 1966.  But, in the end, ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" will remain a classic because of the music.  The album begins with the Blues Magoos' biggest and most familiar hit: the instantly memorable ""We Ain't Got Nothin' Yet.""  This song has everything: a classic, tight structure; snarly garage vocals; a generous helping of Farfisa organ; some very underrated guitar work from Mike Epstein; and a whole lot of directed energy.  The other best tunes on the album include ""Tobacco Road,"" ""Gotta Get Away,"" ""Sometimes I Think About,"" and ""She's Coming Home.""  The truth is that most of the other songs are very good as well, but these are the best of the album.  ""Tobacco Road,"" which was featured on Nuggets, has this incredible freak out right in the middle of the song.  When I first heard it, it seemed to take me to a whole new level of listening.  It reminded me of Wordsworth's ""something evermore about to be.""  It seemed to reveal that there was a lot more possible in a pop song than I had previously imagined.  ""Sometimes I Think About"" is perfectly melancholy, and the organ turns this song into a haunting melody.  ""Gotta Get Away"" and ""She's Coming Home"" are just straight out great rockers.  There are very few albums of the 60s that have this many great songs on them, and I haven't even mentioned the rest of the album.  In fact, one of the greatest strengths of ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" and what makes it a classic is not only its originality and excellence but that it hangs together as an album.  When I think of ""Psychedelic Lollipop,"" I think of it as a whole, warts and all.  ""Psychedelic Lollipop"" so formed my listening habits that it made the Blues Magoos my favorite band for a long, long time.  One time, I even had a dream where I dreamed previously unknown Blues Magoos songs.  If only I could have recorded them the moment I woke up from my dream.",5,"04 2, 2011",Underappreciated Psychedelic Masterpiece!,1301702400,{'Format:': ' Vinyl'},,,second away hard magoos soul pop paul i'll originality use rock work longer hardwired snarly event remind stumble like evermore vocal hip tobacco way level straight song could hear turn garage-psychedelic guy prescient think beatles listen title grow least tight get generous revere favorite many wordsworth's name enough seem take roll something farfisa great rocker musical amaze knowing song must glow structure middle long taste music seem existed write great underrated melancholy wart tune upon one fact instantly wake lot new future strength make amazes unknown right possible whole lollipop psychedelic hair haunt mention believe home suit single good direct perfectly probably together collection energy first help reveal gotta number influence remain early listening band time ain't form album get dream melody sometimes everything familiar introduce truth felt excellence byrd nostalgic somehow epstein even nothin hang hit organ include rest band blue cheat year garage guitar nugget road listen memorable incredible big bought imagine never albums create moment mike incredibly best classic yet record without come freak emotional content end dream make raider feature credit previously well get begin habit

This is the last studio album with guitarist Ulrich Roth, and the first with drummer Herman Rarebell. A very good transition album from the Scorpions of the 70's to the group of the 80's.  It starts off hard with ""Steamrock Fever"", a bouncy and rocking song you'll want to listen to over and over. Following that is ""We'll Burn the Sky"", with lyrics about death and meeting up again... this is a good song, but it sounds even better on Tokyo Tapes. After that is ""I've Got To Be Free"", one of Roth's last songs for the group, and yet another rocker, and then ""The Riot of Your Life"" with its oddly prophetic lyrics.  Side 2 (or the fifth song on the album) is ""The Sails of Charon"", a magnificent piece of guitar work throughout, and a great song to listen to - the only unfortunate thing being that the only place you'll find the original full length version (5:16) of the song is on vinyl... the CDs have the shorter (4:23) version of the song. You really need to hear the full thing to get the full impact of it, but it's still very good even in its shorter version. After that is the softer ""Your Light"", Roth's other contribution to the song writing on the album.  Next up is easily the hardest rocking song on the album, and one of the weirdest, ""He's A Woman, She's A Man"" - just listen to the lyrics to get your mind blown. This one will really remind you of their later works, albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackout/dp/B000001EUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-at-First-Sting/dp/B000001EUR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love at First Sting</a>&nbsp;- not really surprising, as Herman Rarebell co-wrote it along with Schenker and Meine. This song will blow your speakers out, no problem.  The last song on the (regular) album is ""Born to Touch Your Feelings"", a mellow one from Schenker & Meine, quite good. If you get the reissued CD with the bonus tracks, you'll also have ""Suspender Love"" on the album (the only other place you'll find that is on Tokyo Tapes, unfortunately), which is good and bouncy. The final cut (bonus) is a live version of ""Polar Nights"", with some great guitar work.  This is a great album to get if your a Scorpions fan - it's got a bit of everything, and is an excellent bridge between the two 'generations' of Scorpions. ""He's A Woman, She's A Man"", ""Steamrock Fever"", ""We'll Burn the Sky"" and ""The Sails of Charon"" are all excellent, songs you'll play again and again and again... and the rest of the album is very much worth it as well.

Two years later he released his NOW featuring the lead single and slow jam classic Lifetime. Now also features one song from 1999's The Best Man soundtrack W/as My Girl. Maxwell is stronger at ballads as showcased in the slow jams For Lovers Only and his cover of This Woman's Work. For Lovers Only is for the grown & sexy and gives off the vibe where you light some candles for your lady and spend the night engaged in conversation. While This Woman's Work is one of the best covers ever. Part of the reason why his cover of Kate Bush's ""This Woman's Work"" (revived here after being debuted on his MTV Unplugged) is so startling -- it's not just that he's picked an unlikely source for a great cover, but it's the one time that he marries his sumptuous sound to a song with substance you can feel the emotion and pain in his voice. Maxwell has been M.I.A. for the past six years and I wish he would release his next CD ASAP ! If I were to give Maxwell any advice I'd say two things. The first is get back with R.

I have seen them live 4 times, and have 3 of JP's drumsticks that he handed to my girlfriend at the end of 3 separate shows proudly displayed in my home. So, I feel I have some credibility here. It's always an event for me when a new C! record comes out. I was especially excited for ""Beale St."" Clutch had been on a tremendous role with their previous 4 releases, ""P.R.F"",""Slow Hole"",""Blast Tyrant"", and ""Robot Hive"". My 4 personal favorite C! albums.  Right from the get I could tell this one was going to be different. I have listened to it about 5 times now and it truly is. The music is more subdued throughout the entire album. Neil's vocals aren't subdued but they aren't as up front as they usually are. I honestly cannot hear Dan Maines bass. Tim Sult pretty much just plays rhythm throughout. And the almighty  Jean Paul Gaster is used simply to keep a beat. Now you'd think that being done by Clutch this would create a driving wall of sound, But it doesn't.  In my opinion it creates an uninspired sounding record. To me there are 3 signatures for this band that it could not survive without; Tim's guitar, Neil's vocals, and JP's drums. Without any one of these guys Clutch just would not work. To me it seems like JP has been removed from the band on this album. I mean I know he's still there but he really didn't have to be. JP is the back bone of this band and it seems like he was handicapped here. Any drummer can keep a simple beat. And Neil's vocals don't seem to gel with the music as nicely as they usually do. I feel they've lost their edge on this album - like putting a governor on a super charged GTO.  All that being said I don't hate this album, I could never hate a Clutch album. The first 6 songs are definitely better than the second 6. And ""Electric Worry"" is an instant classic and probably one of their all time best songs. In the second 6 there is a song called ""When Vegans Attack"". This song sounds like a Black Crows song to me and that is not a good thing. The day C! starts sounding like the Black Crows I believe is a sign of the apocalypse. My favorite song in the second half of the album is ""Mr Shiny Cadillackness"".  I do believe the record is a solid 3 stars, it's good but I think it is their weakest effort yet. This band is constantly reinventing itself so I am not worried. I really felt the direction they were going with ""Blast"" and ""Robot"" was the right path. I don't have a problem with the blues influence at all. ""Robot"" was bluesy.

And, once again, as with the Rubinstein and Toscanini set RCA has gotten the packaging right! The box is well laid out with a nice hard cover book with all of the tracking information and an alpha discography which I find very useful.  And it may be a small point, or none at all to other listeners, but very important to me is that the program information is on the spine of each CD case so you don't have to pull the CDs out to see which one is which.  DG did a terrible job with the Karajan 60s set with it's maze of boxes and nothing on the spines.  This set is very user friendly.

I found Steve Stills vocals a bit flat and at times he is possibly a bit out if it. Watch his performance on the video and you will see him appearing slightly wasted at times sadly. Its the music I am loving the most, great song selection and many fine moments. The DVD is also very special, Neils version of Old Man is so emotional.

As a consequence, there are several versions of this score.  So it is fortunate that we now have Benvenuto Cellini more or less as Berlioz himself conceived it. I think it is a very beautiful score and only one other recording has been tried in the studio, that on Philips with Colin Davis. To him is due all credit and highest honors for his pioneering effort with this opera, Nelson is the second conductor to take on this work in the studio and does so without any apologies as this performance is stunning. There have been very mixed reviews on this recording. Gregory Kunde is just about Gedda's equal. His tone is sweet, strong, full and agile.  I don't hear the strain or unpleasant tone quality that some have complained about. Joyce di Donato as Ascanio sings with glorious tone and interpretation. She makes her music greater than it might be in lesser hands. She is superior to Berbie on Davis' recording. All the other roles are very well sung and equal to their predecessors on the Davis release.  On hearing the orchestration played at its intended tempo, one can understand how the singers of the premiere must have been overwhelmed by its demands. They were apparently inadequate to start with.  But Berlioz's demands are surmountable as  Davis convincingly proved and now Nelson proves beyond any doubt. The role of Teresa seems to be a difficult role to fill. I never much cared for Eda-Pierre in the 1st recording and although Ciofi is an improvement, I would prefer a soprano with a richer timber and steadier voice. In duets and ensembles she does hold her own rather well.  The sound is excellent and this belongs on the shelf next to Colin Davis. Personal taste will dictate the order on that shelf.

I tend to think of myself as being a bit outside the usually demographic of Paramore fans, being in my late 20's, but I don't care! I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this album, and to be honest, it's one the first time in years that I've paid any attention to the 'official release date' from any band.  Paramore has catchy, rock driven tunes with smart, well written lyrics. Hayley Williams' vocals are stunning...for such a tiny person she sure has a set of powerhouse pipes. I actually had expected this album to be a lot darker then the 1st two albums, after hearing the first single, ""Ignorance"" and also knowing they were going thru some personal band turmoil while recording ""brand new eyes"". But besides ""Ignorance"", and some lyrics you can tell are clearly pointed at her bandmates in other songs, there is no huge addition of somberness compared with the other albums.  Paramore has progressed and grown, while still retaining their distinct Paramore sound. I also think the drummer, Zac Farro, was given a little more liberty in letting the drums really lead and set the tone on a few songs. There are a few quieter, pretty songs like ""Misguided Ghosts"" and ""The Only Exception"". Thinking back, I can't recall any slower jams on the other albums that are acoustic and lacking drums like ""Misguided Ghosts"", and that stood out for me. But don't take that the wrong way, they're both awesome songs, and show a different side of what Paramore can accomplish.  While writing this review I struggled to find something I didn't like about this album(trying to be well rounded and not just chock full of praise!), and I'm sorry, but I couldn't come up with anything, I'm a fan, not a critic.  On the whole, the album is amazing and I think will stand out as one of the year's best Rock/Alternative albums, just like ""Riot!"" did in 2007.  A must have in my opinion.  Definitely check them out when they start touring in support of ""brand new eyes"". I caught them last summer opening for No Doubt, and it was an excellent show.

305,1297604,A3VOKCBMCB6S6T,B0009RJP3M,jacobdubya,False,"To call Buck 65 a hip hop artist would be too limiting.  While a hip hop artist by default (and very amazing in respect to that genre), Buck 65's influences extend well beyond the scope of hip hop.  On Talkin' Honky Blues, Buck created an innovative blend of hip hop, country, and folk, with a slight hint of rock. But on this album, he swings the door open to all of his influences and holds back nothing to create one of the most creative and genre-bending albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, with hardly any two songs sounding similar.  While primarily rooted in his hip hop and country roots, gives us a little dash of everything from electro to punk to trip hop. While I would recommend more accessible albums such as Talkin' Honky Blues or This Right Here Is Buck 65 (a collection of songs from previous albums updated and compiled for American release) for those who are new to Buck's music, I believe anyone with a taste for musical diversity and experimentation would greatly appreciate this album.  Rough House Blues - The opening track is a Johnny Cash influenced country/hip-hop hybrid complete with bluesy piano and scratching that I'm sure was intended to ease the transition from Talkin' Honky Blues into this album - granted, this track gives more weight to the country influence than anything on the prior album.  Devil's Eyes - One of the furthest things from hip hop that Buck has ever done, but one of my favorites. Devil's Eyes is a baroque rock number with dual male/female singing and grandiose string arrangements accompanied by a pounding guitar/bass/drum rhythm.  Le65isme - Strong Captain Beefheart influence. Avant-garde track complete with odd time signatures, discordant guitar riffs, a single driving bass line, complex drum patterns, and half-sung/half-spoken vocals traded off between Buck and a woman reciting in French. Culminates with a single, frantic rhythm persisting for a minute and a half that gradually builds in tension before abruptly returning to the opening section that leads the song out.  The Suffering Machine - Dark folk that portrays Buck's knack for storytelling and his stream-of-consciousness lyrical style with soaring, melodic female vocals in the background.  Surrender to Strangeness - Reminiscent of a latter-day Radiohead.  Very somber throughout, with a combination of strings, piano, scratching and sampling towards the end.  Kennedy Killed The Hat - Frantic electro-influenced track that sounds like Aphex Twin with Iggy Pop on vocals. Another highlight of the album.  The Floor - Very haunting track with Buck reciting a poem over somber piano accompaniment. The climax is a very intense country/hip-hop/baroque mixture with banjo, scratching, and strings that leads the song out.  Blood of a Young Wolf - Apex song of the album, and one of Buck's best songs in general. Very melancholy country number with rapped vocals that portray the theme of alienation from modern society.  Drunk Without Drinking - Another somber country/folk number.  Blanc-Bec - Very hardcore-punk influenced with a driving distorted bass riff over fast, punk drum beat. Very nihilistic sounding lyrics and some great scratching at the end.  Corrugated Tin Facade - Most resembles anything from Talkin' Honky Blues, very melancholy hip hop track.  Drawing Curtains - Dark and brooding trip-hop influenced song with Buck and a French female trading off vocals.  Devil's Eyes (Piano Version) - A piano version of the earlier song with vocals in French.",5,"10 8, 2010",One of the most diverse and experimental albums I've ever heard.,1286496000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,slight track mixture lyric house female twin culminates abruptly hardcore-punk devil's pop door build sample taste i've update rock artist ease buck dual complex apex genre soar gradually country buck's default riff like drive theme ever influence vocal intense woman blanc-bec hip recommend hybrid discordant aphex trip-hop banjo signature piano suffer avant-garde influence song recite granted section latter-day arrangement half half-sung/half-spoken pattern stream-of-consciousness open young portray curtain create nothing modern dark towards anyone hear opening sure beefheart drum drink creative great radiohead scratch eye musical amazing male/female grandiose song persist bass root kennedy blood root nihilistic rap baroque music earlier line floor little thing melancholy hop folk french storytelling one alienation beat scope new surrender back guitar/bass/drum right hint american rough cash bluesy string accompany odd similar lyrical iggy accompaniment beyond country/hip-hop/baroque favorite haunt believe reminiscent sound give single limit johnny sing innovative strangeness drunk highlight primarily collection machine hardly number influence pleasure minute weight talkin electro-influenced facade version transition intend time melodic dash draw call experimentation album rhythm would return riff resembles background portrays hold brood distort country/hip-hop everything extend swing blend general accessible pound complete trade poem trading fast compile blue genre-bending release lead guitar album create appreciate prior hat wolf i'm style honky combination best two society somber previous tension without frantic country/folk punk furthest sound throughout end trip greatly kill respect diversity well captain do another strong climax knack anything corrugated string electro tin

315,921736,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0091LS07E,J. Richardson,False,"After 2009's somewhat disappointing The Element of Freedom, Alicia Keys is back with her fifth studio album Girl On Fire. With As I Am it seemed as if Alicia Keys had improved on her already beautiful sound, but with The Element of Freedom it felt like she took a few steps back. Not just in comparison to As I Am, but in comparison to her earlier works as well. Sadly with Girl On Fire we continue to see Ms. Keys go in the wrong direction.  When the album's piano filled intro ""De Novo Adagio"" came on my first thought was: great. Her original three albums all started off with a piano intro, but The Element of Freedom didn't. So in my mind this was Alicia Keys maybe, hopefully, returning to the sound that I originally loved from her. Unfortunately it leads into ""Brand New Me"" which lacks any sort of energy whatsoever. All I can say is she states ""Don't be mad, it's just brand new kind of me."" So you can either accept these new changes or move on with your life.  What exactly is wrong with this album though? In short it lacks passion. I don't listen to many female artists because a lot of the music is generic and forgettable, but with Alicia it's always been different. Sure she was never the best songwriter, many reviewers saying she uses a lot of cliches in her lyrics, but it was the amount of heart and soul that she put into each lyric that made her music great. She was able to make you feel something. Sadly the only thing I truly felt on here was bored.  Not only that but she seems to have lost that soul element in her music. Her first three albums, especially Songs In A Minor, all had a very soulful approach to the R&B format. From the way she said her lyrics to the style of production, it was something extremely different from your run-of-the-mill R&B artist. Girl On Fire on the other hand doesn't really do anything new and seems to fall victim to conformity.  Production wise this album is nothing special. As I said this album sounds like it's conforming to what's out at the moment and most of that has to do with the production. Now I'm a bass guy. I love some good bass when it's used properly. With that said, the bass present on Girl On Fire feels very out of place and awkward. It's not like Alicia Keys has never had songs with bass before, but it just didn't seem to work on here and wound up ruining the overall sound of the album. Where this album shines is when the production mostly consists of a piano and a very simple, low-tempo, bass line.  Finally, the guests Ms. Keys decided to recruit for this album are awful. We all know who Nicki Minaj is because, unfortunately, the talentless transvestite is a househould name. However, I wasn't familiar with Maxwell until I heard him on track seven ""Fire We Make"". The song serves as Girl On Fire's ""sexy"" song which is territory Alicia Keys hasn't really touched on much throughout her eleven year career. So it was kind of interesting to hear something like this from Ms. Keys, but Maxwell.... eh. His voice is so generic, forgettable, and forced I just found it hard to enjoy the song.  Standout Songs: ""When It's All Over"" & ""One Thing""  Overall Score: 6/10 - Bottom line this album just didn't do what I wanted it to. After The Element of Freedom I wanted this to make me fall back in love with Ms. Keys, but Girl On Fire lacks some major elements that made her first three albums so enjoyable. If you're a fan of Alicia Keys I would still recommend giving this a listen.

THE PRODUCERS is absolutely wonderful. Mel Brooks' Oscar-winning film for Best Original Screenplay in 1968 is back and kicking in a soundtrack. THE PRODUCERS is the off-the-wall story of Max Bialystock, a Broadway musical producer who just can't seem to get one of his shows to be a success. In fact, all of his shows bomb horrribly until he meets an accountant named Leo Bloom. He has the notion that a Broadway failure could become profitable if it is manipulated properly. Jazzed by the idea, they combine efforts to put out a real flop honoring Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, entitled ""Springtime For Hitler,"" but it becomes a hit with audiences when people are attracted to the absolute guadiness involved. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick lead the way as Bialystock and Bloom respectively. The acting is very good, and Lane is truly at his very best. Both do excellent jobs with the songs, especially when Lane outrageously spits out the jist of the show in less than a minute of music in ""Betrayed."" The album starts out with ""Opening Night,"" which basically sets the mood for the rest of the cd. This is followed up by ""King of Hollywood,"" which is quite catchy, and delivered perfectly by Lane. Other standouts include the hilarious ""Keep It Gay,"" the love song/serenade-type song ""That Face,"" and the sensational climax of the album, ""Springtime For Hitler,"" almost identical to the version in the film.

You could spend days listening to people gush over it, but you probably would give up after about an hour, because everyone would essentially be repeating the same idea: ""this is one of the greatest albums ever.""  One almost begins to suspect that these are nothing more than rabid Massive Attack fans, for whom Robert Del Naja and company can do no wrong.  You would be correct, but that doesn't change the fact that these fans are not overstating the virtues of MEZZANINE at all; if anything, they're understating them. This is the best kind of music: the kind that appeals to everyone.  If you absolutely MUST pigeonhole this album, you can call it trip-hop, but MEZZANINE is much more than electronica mixed with hip-hop.  The songs build slowly, starting with a simple beat before moving to heights of every kind of emotion you can think of, from utter sadness (""Teardrop"") to paranoia (""Man Next Door"") to the pleasures of the flesh (""Inertia Creeps,"" hands down the most erotic song in history).

326,765045,A3653K8QERQ72O,B00151W394,american atheist,False,"I will make this brief and straight to the point: Hard candy is an excellent album. I had qualms regarding the naming of this album and I still do. Hard candy is a cheesy name for a non-cheesy album. But let me go on with the review. Like all Madonna albums, hard candy gets better and better with multiple listens. In fact, even the songs that have already been heard, like miles away and 4 minutes, get better with multiple listens as the different layers of the song's melody and beats are detected. Like all Madonna albums, hard candy has at least one song that tackles the concept of music and the euphoric and therapeutic effects that music exerts on the listener or the dancer. And as you all know by now, Madonna does her best and produces her finest whenever the song is about the virtues of music.  Like all Madonna albums, Hard Candy has songs that should not have been there. This is ok because it is just about the only thing that makes Madonna appear human like us in the sense that she is not perfect and that she, like the rest of us, slips every now and then. And now onto the songs:  Candy Shop (6/10): this song has been heard already. It is an ok song. It will be skipped by most listeners because it is not remarkable in anyway and it has been heard quite a lot already.  4 mins (10/10): if I could point out an under-rated song on Hard Candy, it would probably be 4 mins. This song has a beautiful melody and killer beats. It is new, in fact futuristic, and very upbeat. Still, people do not seem to give it its worth probably because of premature excessive exposure to poor sound quality leaks. Go timbo! Go madge!  4 mins gets nothing below a 10!  Give it to me (10/10): this is the essence of Hard Candy. It is a song to be heard, not described! Killer beats, uplifting lyrics, gorgeous rhythm ...this song is probably a re-incarnation of madonna's old song everybody! When Madonna says ""give it to me"" think ""everybody""; when she says ""no one's gonna show me""....think ""common dance and sing"".......nothing below a 10! Expect this song to be played in clubs.  Heartbeat (10/10): this is madonna's gift to those who like pink, nelly furtado, and urban rhythms. The Say It Right type of beats are all over the song superimposed on a gorgeous melody. The first time I heard this song, I almost cried when Madonna said ""once I get going I am gone"" . The ending of the song has a very nice beat that comes with the words ""madolla, madolla, madolla""  Miles away (10/10): I give this song a 10 simply because it is the highest score I can give; miles away is a superb song. it is rich and multilayered both lyrically and musically. The subject matter of this song is very unique. Many artists have tackled the experience of long distance love. But this is the first song that I have heard that actually tackles the experience of being with someone who seem to want you and love you only when you're....hhmmm well, not around.... One must wonder how the heck Madonna thought of that? Is this something she herself is going through? Who knows? Anyways, the song has a gorgeous ending sound in the last 30 seconds.  She's not me (8.5/10): this song's true potential is a 10/10. Unfortunately, she's not me got molested, raped, and beheaded by its own producers. This song has a beautiful melody and a good beat. The subject matter is amusing too. Unfortunately, it has a bombastic incongruent midsection that is truly irritating to the ear, especially if you're using headphones; it attacks the song and its atmosphere abruptly and mercilessly rips it apart for 30 seconds starting right at the end of the 2nd minute of the song. Also for some reason, the producers did not allow the song to finish gracefully and just kept it dragging on and on.... Every time you think the song is coming to an end, it all of a sudden starts again. At some point, you also hear someone say ""gotta find a new way to express your""....whatever...but the tone is very annoying and incongruent.  Such a shame because it's actually a great song.  Incredible (4/10): this is a bad song. It is redundant, strange, messy, and too dam long. On top of being a bad song, it just drags on and on refusing to let go of your tired ears. Most people will listen to incredible a few times and then never listen to it again. I am not going to talk about this song more because it does not deserve being described.  Beat goes on (10/10): this is perfection! A treat to the soul, an invitation to let go of the day's stress. Excellent melody, beats, and rhythm. This song should be heard and not described. Everything about it is great and done just right. All in good taste, even the rap in the end is in good taste.  Dance 2nite (10/10): once again Madonna does what she does best. Enough said. Go listen to this song. Gotta Go fast fast fast , if you want this good thing to last. Her voice is just great along with JT's. you don't have to be beautiful to be understood. You don't have to be rich and famous to be good.....i wanna dance tonight so take a chance tonight..... Spanish lessons (1/10): this is a stab right into the left ventricle of the heart of Hard Candy. It is awful to say the least. It's bad and annoying. It truly irritates the ear. Avoid it like the plague, especially if you have headphones on. It would ruin the entire atmosphere of hard candy. Whatever damage incredible had inflicted on the album, Spanish lessons completes that damage. Listen to this song at your own risk.  Devil (10/10): Excellent ballad. Just perfect in every way you can think of. Like the other 10/10 songs on this album, this song is addictive and will make you listen to it repeatedly because it just sounds so good.  Go timbo!!! I hope Madonna makes a video for this one.  Voices (10/10): this is the song I listen to the most. I listen to voices at least once everyday. It's short and it could have been a bit longer I guess. Maybe I say that because it's an awesome song. by the way, this and devil, along with miles away, are the most lyrically rich songs in the album. Voices is a wonderful ending for the album. Madonna's superb taste in music can be felt all throughout this song from beginning to end.  Ring my bell (5/10): there's a reason why this is a bonus track! Still, if Madonna was truly hell bent on having a 12-track album, then this song would have been a totally acceptable and more palatable alternative to the annoying horrendous Spanish lessons.  The cover art: while I absolutely adore this album, I do think that the cover is ghastly! Why the weird concentric cheap looking pinkish circles behind her is anyone's guess. Why are her legs and hair cut out from the picture? And why is she wearing this trashy leather/boxing outfit thingy? And why is the facial expression erotic? This album is not about sex and it is not cheesy either. Therefore, the cover art is just out of place. Besides, I do like Madonna and I do believe that she is in good health but there are certain things and certain moves that a 50 y/o mother should not do because it's just not classy. The cover of COADF was also colorful and a bit erotic but it was in good taste.  Summary: Hard Candy is an excellent album overall. However, Madonna, like the rest of us, is not perfect and that shows in hard candy, as it sustained 4 stabs: 1-cheesy name that has been used for a stupid horrible movie about a little brat torturing a pedophile. 2-ghastly cover art. 3-incredible. 4-spanish  lessons.

331,1237422,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00005AWKG,Mark Eremite,True,"I discovered Dave Seaman two years ago when he joined the highly touted DJs starring in Renaissance's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-Series/dp/B000E9X798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters Series</a>.  His volume of that series is perhaps one of the greatest progressive house albums I've heard in a long, long time, so I started moving backwards to see where this man came from.  From his extensive history I picked out this set, released five years prior to the Renaissance album of his I love so much (and ten years after he released his first album under&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mixmag/dp/B000003QM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mixmag</a>).  It would be interesting, I thought, to see how his sytle had evolved.  The first disc starts inauspiciously with a neutered version of ""Humanity"" by A Guy Called Gerald.  Normally a deep, tribal track, Seaman slices the low ends in half and stretches out the ambivalent backgrounds.  The rhythm section is still there, almost urgently, but it clashes, fast under slow.  I dwell on it here because, as the intro to his set, it sets the tone for what falters about the rest of the record.  Seaman tries to waver between lanky trance beats and their grittier bedroom buddies (tribal and lo-fi funk), but the result is uneven.  A better start would've been his second track, Minimalistics ""Struggle For Pleasure,"" and its luscious slide into the third track, a dirty dancing duo between Quaye's ""Spiritualized"" and Marcel's ""The Path.""  Although it takes the oomph out of the set-up, it sets up a more consistent (and more satisfying) house-lounge mood.  Too bad it doesn't stay consistent.  Imagine putting on a Sounds of the Sea relaxation record, and just as you're about to fall asleep, you hear the ""Aarr, me matey!"" of a pirate.  Sure, technically it's a sound of the sea, but out of place, none the less.  Likewise, Seaman's deep, dreamy mood setting is overthrown by more than a few cuts that can't stay in place.  His mixes of Moby's ""Southside,"" the Science Department's ""Breathe,"" and the final three tracks aren't bad per se, but they ride the line between distant trance and cheesy house repetitiveness.  The few shining spots in this line-up (""Janeiro"" and ""Void"") do little to distract from the otherwise dismissable dull around them.  Disc Two is a lot more aggressive, and more cohesive as a result.  The start-up, Loafer's ""Travelogue"" is an aptly titled head-trip trance track that leads deliciously into a five-track block of deep house beauty that, while not astounding, is bound to get you to close your eyes and shake one or more parts of your body.  This is where you see the Seaman-to-come, the atmospheric rumbles of something that is equal parts storm cloud and tectonic plate.  Seaman loses the thread, though, as soon as ""Love Like Sleep"" engages the wheels with its eye-rolling vocal track (sorry, Terra Deva) and its over-done backbeat.  Even though this is preceded by a well-pared Junkie XL piece, it's clear the aural plot is still off-track somewhere, especially when the closing number, Way Out West's earnest ""Mindcircus,"" unspools.  A lovely number in and of itself, it doesn't bookend the set well, making you wonder if you didn't just hear the ending to a completely different album.  With glints of the brilliance to come, Seaman's DESIRE doesn't fullfill so much as it does betoken.

It perfectly enscapulates one of the most daunting runs in rock music history, the early career of The Eagles. There are several major singles here, as well as the famous album track Desperado (which was, oddly enough, never released as a single.) All of the tracks are great. This is completely different (for the most part) music than that which the band would later make famous on Hotel California, but equally as good; some would say better. There are several country-styled rockers (Take It Easy, Lyin' Eyes, Peaceful Easy Feeling, etc.) that the early Eagles records did so well. However, there are several differently styled songs as well. Desperado and Best of My Love are two great Don Henley-crooned ballads, while Witchy Woman and One of These Nights are forays into different styles of music. All of them are great, however. The Eagles are undoubtedly one of the best, or at the very least most important and most successful, band in rock 'n' roll history, and this disc is a perfect retrospective of their early years.

349,66312,A2FJ2JSSJPPCJB,B000001M1W,Amazon Customer,False,"'The Nightmare Before Christmas' lies at the top of Danny Elfman's superior film scores, because it allowed him to pour all of his creative talents into one phenomenal work.  This isn't just underscore, it's the feature--this time Elfman scores a MUSICAL, with music that accentuates Tim Burton's brilliant story.  The mood is deliciously dark and yet devilishly fun; it's moody and evokes fear, but like a roller coaster, you know it's all in good fun. The vocal songs are well-orchestrated, and the lyrics range from clever fun to poetry at its most beautiful.  The ""Overture"" builds and builds, pulling you in until you can't resist listening further.  The ""Opening"" is handled perfectly by Patrick Stewart, with a very subtle bit of ""Sally's Song"" playing underneath.  His reading, like a creative father reading a bedtime story to his child, is dead-on and just what's needed to lull the listener/viewer into the realm where reality fades into imagination.  The unabashed fun of ""This is Halloween"" makes you crave the holiday all over again.  The sometimes terrifying descriptions pass right by without affecting you, because you're too busy having fun--the general effect of the whole film. Elfman himself voices Jack, and his scary, longing reading and dramatic, over-pronounced phrasing gives Jack a wonderfully distinct voice.  ""In the Forest"" is a great piece that tremors with excitement and a foreshadow of the coming adventure, shown best with the drumming, twinkling segue into ""What's This?"" at the end which lasts only a few seconds and fades with quiet chimes playing the song's opening notes.  The actual performance of ""What's This?"" soars, with sweet, delightful lyrics and Elfman projecting Jack's wide-eyed glee so well that one can see the skeleton's grinning face without even watching the movie--he sounds as if he might burst with joy!  The ""Town Meeting Song"" has sometimes scary lyrics, especially with Jack's introduction of ""Sandy Claws,"" ""like a lobster huge and red"" who ""sets out to slay with his reindeer on,"" but the melody is so cute and the feeling so fun that it's impossible to mind.  ""Making Christmas,"" a full-cast effort, has a bombastic, side-splitting feel reminiscent of a Broadway production number.  Listen for when Jack tells a citizen who's proud of his 'dead-rat hat' ""That's all wrong...It's been dead for much too long; Try something fresher, something pleasant!"" The highly disturbing ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws,"" performed superbly by Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Elfman as Lock, Shock, and Barrel, is one of the soundtrack's high points.  The battling siblings go on and on at length about their devious deed of nabbing the Christmas icon and torturing him to distraction--the lyrics are cruel, horrible, and downright sadistic.  The first time around, in fact, it may shock and revolt you--it did me.  But a really excellent marriage of orchestration, lyrics, and performers outmatched only by ""Oogie Boogie's Song.""  The malevolence heightens with each verse, the brass blaring and the sailing flute turning up the fun.  The singers sound like they're getting a real kick out of it--O'Hara sounds positively giddy when she squeals, ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws/Beat 'im with a stick...""  It will surely frighten most children, and even older listeners who enjoy it may feel guilty for doing so, but just let yourself go and laugh out loud--that's the intention.  O'Hara, also the voice of Sally, does a lovely understated job on the beautiful, heartbreaking ""Sally's Song."" Showstopping ""Oogie Boogie's Song,"" belted emphatically by the great Ken Page, is a wonderful take on the classic jazz-injected show tune, with stong piano comping and a hot, stomping blues arrangement tinged with a sexy, pumping stripper beat.  The song benefits extraordinarily from the soulful voice of Broadway musical veteran Page (though this is a far cry from his Old Deuteronomy in 'Cats'), who wails, growls, and cackles his way through the lyrics.  His robust, larger-than-life voice combines with his impeccable phrasing and wonderful hammy reading to make this a groovy treat.  Listen to how he laughs at Santa's plea for mercy!  This crucial scene in the movie should be terrifying and dramatic, but this song does the trick by making it so much fun; Oogie's words may be threatening, but he's enjoying himself so much you end up being swept along for the ride.  Hearing Page work his charm is a marvel for the listener, a masterful casting choice that pays off big time.  A plus--the soundtrack contains the middle of the song, missing from the film.  The letdown--besides ""This is Halloween,"" where he has two spoken lines, this is his only number. Elfman's use of cues is probably better here than in any of his scores, with so many different ones to choose from.  ""Sally's Song"" is used a few times to great effect, as are ""Jack's Lament"" and ""What's This?"" which are both put to good use in the dynamic ""Christmas Eve Montage.""  Many of the score's great elements come together here, inducing fear, excitement, glee, and the foreshadowed sense that everything is horribly wrong.  With a simultaneously scary and gorgeous Christmas feel highly reminiscent of Elfman's nice work from the Bill Murray vehicle 'Scrooged' five years earlier, it becomes peaceful and beautiful at times, threatening and harsh at others; at one point, it even breaks into a wild tuba-trumpet romp that hearkens back to his brilliant score from 'Beetlejuice.'  Doctor Finkelstein gets his own cantankerous cue as well, and the most enjoyable cue is the lascivious stripper music that kicks up repeatedly during ""To the Rescue,"" which is set in Oogie Boogie's lair. The ""End Title"" music is one of the most amazing tracks, simply because it is a well-arranged instrumental medley of all the vocal songs, with ""Jack's Lament"" and ""Making Christmas"" reappearing throughout.  Included are a whimsical waltz of ""This is Halloween,"" a beautiful ""Sally's Song,"" a maniacal ""Making Christmas,"" and an all-out swinging sample of ""Oogie Boogie's Song,"" riddled with saucy piano and sassy brass.",5,"10 21, 2000","Elfman Scores Again with a Merry, Scary 'Christmas'",972086400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},85.0,,performer horrible heartbreaking over-pronounced paul jack unabashed sample performance speak who's fear lie well-orchestrated talent underscore try overture subtle one comping cackle sweep time reindeer child peaceful point length many treat open evokes benefit make different note song contains superior all-out groovy range sail glee singer long verse stong fun outmatch im lobster affect really tuba-trumpet bill beat battle right reuben movie--he point claws/beat let far barrel well-arranged shock blare letdown--besides child cry bit deliciously pump pleasant highly imagination oogie actual sadistic excitement everything track it--o'hara torture trick ting sound father lull hammy quiet stick set nab two bombastic last without tremor proud go tim they're phenomenal may feel know o'hara masterful laugh lyric combine score mercy wonderfully joy feature--this much effort enjoy riddle like devilishly soundtrack coaster scary dead-on elfman santa's superbly resist burton's come moody might montage twinkle emphatically crave listen title cute charm can't enjoyable perform rescue dark soundtrack's terrify hear repeatedly nightmare distraction--the element musical good long jack's frighten lock one lascivious show revolt page icon growls whole sweet reminiscent give vehicle maniacal perfectly gorgeous stomp effect first line laugh turn robust inducing time handle top general also broadway voice see brilliant five year lament listener scene choose pee-wee christmas choice play pas flute yet story classic old hearkens though fade impossible ken introduction roller segue harsh listener/viewer he's phrasing film horribly squeal nice catherine tune deuteronomy vocal build use listener work poetry red fresher positively romp drum piano song simply clever others reality hot job cruel orchestration pour tell larger-than-life voice take big score's medley veteran middle wrong...it's music huge dynamic sally foreshadow plus--the whimsical set guilty dead face plea devious pull oogie's reappear back kick wrong sense beautiful sandy sibling stewart good adventure foreshadow side-splitting allow danny soulful use soar mind mood what's sometimes holiday chime heighten distinct showstopping giddy blue score make project watch hat piece word best along stripper break come saucy throughout wonderful well impeccable get arrangement forest surely halloween wild simultaneously belt read wide-eyed lovely boogie's way marriage cue full-cast movie doctor realm ride high citizen kick something great creative amaze malevolence feel real threaten song's sally's claw elfman's description earlier fun--the grinning put enjoy that's skeleton's include fact miss need understated loud--that's slay beetlejuice underneath cantankerous sexy sound lair probably finkelstein together disturb swing bedtime pay accentuate number waltz listen meeting downright sassy especially melody patrick burst town instrumental scrooged production eve even crucial brass cast deed second murray jazz-injected cat marvel delightful around dead-rat becomes you--it excellent wail intention end make get busy dramatic kidnap show extraordinarily old herman cue

357,496914,A3I6OV5JILAPMJ,B00006BTDW,Curt Surly,False,"I've been keen on 16HP since first picking up ""Sackcloth and Ashes"".  I'd read a review in Rolling Stone, of all places, that compared them favorably with Nick Cave. That was many years ago, but I've kept with them for the most part.  Poverty has kept me from this album until I finally picked it up a few weeks back. I was immediately struck with the space created with the sparse instrumentation. I haven't been able to stop listening to this album.  It is just so majestic and pure and light. Like the deeper truths that most certainly haunt this album.  Gone is the vainglorious, erratically destructive  god of the Old Testament.  There is Christ on this record, but he is the Christ of the sacred Gnostic texts that demand initiation before their truths can be revealed.  I had heard 16HP's arrangement of the Hungarian ""Outlaw Song"" on the compilation of traditional European folk material that came with second issue of Tyr: Journal of Myth, Culture, and Tradition.  I was ecstatic to learn of their participation with Tyr because it signaled an interest in the old gods, before the outbreak of Christianity laid waste to the halls and traditions of Pagan Europe. Yea, the themes of 'Folklore' have transcended the ""fire and brimstone"" Edwards experienced as a child through the preaching of his Grandfather, a Nazarene Minister.  I'm loathe to describe this album as ""dark"" because it doesn't capture the many shades and nuances found throughout.  The album is sparse and melancholic but above all it is Spiritual.  In the same way that certain gospel songs are able to command such power with limited instrumentation and seemingly simple vocal phrasings.  To me, David Eugene Edwards' lyrics focus on the  wretched lamenting in the desert of the man who feels forsaken by fate and by man. He appears to be far less preoccupied with the ""mighty, cleansing power of the Lord"" this go round.  This is the musical equivalent to T.S. Eliot's epic modernist poem, ""The Wasteland"".  ""Alone and Forsaken"" evokes more than just the memory and presence of Hank Williams, it also describes a Point-of-view that mourns the loss of tradition and the desecration by mass culture of all things Spiritual. Edwards captures perfectly the pure agony of a loss that is basically beyond verbalization.  ""Sinnerman"" has a different vocal arrangement than the other versions that I've heard.  Like everything else here, and like Nick Cave's  albums, ""The Boatman's Call"" and ""For No More Shall We Part"", the instrumentation is gorgeous.  It will make you weep by itself. Particularly when the piano kicks in on the  downtrodden ""Beyond the Pale.  This is a pretty record that is ultimately disconcerting in its somber themes and funerary arrangements. But oh, there is so much joy to be had if you can just find it.  I am most exhilarated by  their forays into traditional Tuvan throat singing  on ""Horse Head Fiddle"" (lament of the igil). Throat singing naturally produces eerie tones that compliment the instrumentation and Edward's spoken narrative and plaintive vocals  on  the track.  All told, these songs are songs to haunt your Self by.  If you like traditional folk that is truly mournful and pained and sparse and lyrical and suffering, this is yours. Take it.

366,689083,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000NJLYD0,Matthew G. Sherwin,False,"Pink Martini still just doesn't get the amount of critical recognition and fan praise that they deserve--oh sure, they've done well; but they really are above and beyond special. This album, called Hey Eugene!, captures Pink Martini doing what comes naturally for them--making great music that is ageless and well arranged. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is equally good. The liner notes provide the song lyrics, song credits and many pictures to enjoy.  The album starts with ""Everywhere;"" the strings and harp begin this number and when China Forbes comes in to sing the lyrics this number takes flight! ""Everywhere"" is a strikingly good love ballad that is both tender and passionate at once. China Forbes also co-wrote this song; and ""Everywhere"" is a major highlight of this album. Listen for ""Tempo Perdido (Lost Time);"" this somewhat Cuban sounding number delights me and the chorus in the background harmonizes to perfection. The brass is well used on ""Tempo Perdido."" China Forbes sings the lyrics very well and the Jefferson High School Gospel Choir helps to enhance the romantic quality of ""Tempo Perdido.""  ""Taya Tan"" showcases what Pink Martini can do when they let their imaginations loose--""Taya Tan"" is an adorable ballad sung mostly in Japanese and it charms me. The English is easy enough to understand, of course, but the Asian qualities of this tune and the Japanese lyrics elude me--not that this detracts from the artistic quality of the number. I think you'll like ""Taya Tan"" especially since the liner notes translate the Japanese lyrics into English.  ""Ojal"" features Pink Martini singing in French as Pink Martini performs this romantic tune beyond perfection! The French lyrics add an element of elegance; I always thought that French was THE elegant language. ""Ojal"" mixes in a few Latin elements (like the horn solo in the middle of the number) and this enhances ""Ojal"" even more.  ""Hey Eugene,"" the title track, begins with a very mellow arrangement that relaxes you; and when China Forbes comes in to sing it's all very well done. Tracey Harris and Dorcas Smith do great on backup vocals, too. ""Hey Eugene"" has Pink Martini doing it all with style and class. There's another gem in ""Syracuse;"" the drums and percussion at the very beginning mesh well with the piano and the singers harmonize wonderfully.  The album ends with Pink Martini performing ""Tea For Two."" We first hear the rarely sung opening lyrics by China Forbes; and then Pink Martini goes into the main portion of the song which many people know very well even today. Jimmy Scott also helps with extra vocals, humming right along with China Forbes on ""Tea For Two."" ""Tea For Two"" is a perfect ending for this album; the slow tempo is most romantic and the musical arrangement is extremely elegant.  Fans of Pink Martini almost certainly have this album already--it was an instant classic collection of enduring songs and ballads.

383,144684,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000002GL2,Tom Benton,False,"""Sadness is a good thing, too,"" says Sting, and he proves it on THE SOUL CAGES.  It's an album which has little in common with any of the master songwriter's other releases.  For one thing, it's somber and cold, but that's due to what inspired it: the death of Sting's father, of whom he was not too fond.  Indeed, fathers show up often in the lyrics of these songs, as do ships and the sea.  Despite the unrest which inspired the album, THE SOUL CAGES has an aura of complete peace surrounding it which is wonderfully soothing.  From the first song, the misty ""Island of Souls"", you know this won't be like anything else Sting has recorded.  ""All This Time"" and ""Mad About You"" are the closest things to pop songs THE SOUL CAGES has to offer.  The songs here are the most album-oriented of Sting's work - meaning that to really understand and appreciate them, they must be heard all at once on the album rather than seperately.  This, along with Sting's declaration that the album was ""introspective"", probably aided THE SOUL CAGES in becoming one of Sting's less financially-successful albums - which is truly a pity.  Every song here is magnificent.  They each create a feeling of isolation and loneliness, sorrow and pain, and yet they wind up feeling more peaceful than any others I've ever heard.  The exception is the instrumental ""Saint Agnes And The Burning Train"", a very interesting flamenco track which no one would guess is a Sting composition.  For the most part, the songs here are relatively calm, like a winter breeze; only on the title track does the music really explode, thanks to immense, booming guitars.  The rest of the album contains tight, strong drumming, atmospheric guitars, and smooth keyboards; occasionally, Kathryn Tickell's northumbrian pipes or Branford Marsalis' saxophone shows up.  Unlike Sting's previous albums, this one feels rather folksy.  Gone is the jazzy rock of THE DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES and ... NOTHING LIKE THE SUN; Sting's ""Blue Turtles Band"" had departed by this point.  Even had they not, though, it wouldn't have mattered; there's no room for Sting's upbeat pop compositions here.  Despite all this talk of the album being wintery, introspective, cold, don't think that the album is gloomy.  It's not.  It's beautiful, emotional, more powerful than any of Sting's other albums.  Sting has said that there was such a long period of time between ... NOTHING LIKE THE SUN and THE SOUL CAGES because, after his father's death, he experienced a severe case of writer's block.  The songs he finally did write - those from this album - were written for him, not for anyone else.  Listening to them, it's clear that Sting was completely unaware that anyone else even existed while writing these songs.  And that's not a bad thing at all.  THE SOUL CAGES was more than just a way for Sting to move on after his father's death (""Why Should I Cry For You"").  It's a masterpiece of reflection on life, death, and love, all set against the backdrop of the sea.  It is an immensely powerful and moving album, eclipsing any of Sting's other works.

Because it was 1969, this album is fraught with needless elements of psychadelia and overt experimentation. Moroever, even the remastered version of the album is incapable of covering up the poor production quality of this ""master work"".  ""Empty Sky"" plods along for well over 8 minutes until it ends with this silly fade-out and fade-in during which Elton provides some ""grooooovy"" overdubs. You really have to LOVE the harpsichord to like ""Val Hala"". Beyond that, the album reads as an instruction manual on how to play the recorder. ""Skyline Pigeon"" is the great song of this album, and even so, this version if far inferior to the versions on ""Rare Masters"" or ""Here or There"". Elton's voice is whiney and nasal; the harpsichord, omnipresent. I will give an honorable mention here to ""Western Ford Gateway"" which is a really good, catchy tune which struggles to get noticed amidst all the experimental debris surrouding it.  Just when you think Elton is going to put out a good song with the grave and serious ""Gulliver"", it suddenly jettisons into come fruity jazz number ""It's Hay Chewed"".

Released during the period of time in his career when he was separated from his longtime writing partner, Bernie Taupin, EJ got experimental, long after losing his muse. The result is an E.P. of disco songs that for each assumed album side (seeing as this is a CD we're talking about) run into each other; the funny thing is, it's hard to tell when the preceding song ends, and the next song begins! Now, as far as the real critiquing goes: EJ starts the seven-song album with a cover of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"" that has to be the most lackluster cover of such an energetic, classic rock song; it does not stray a whit from the unrelenting, highly structured disco beat. The other tracks fare no better. Each song is slightly catchy, but the chords never change, and the blandness of each following tune makes the result entirely forgettable.

402,452360,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00005LK1Q,General Breadbasket,False,"In 1973 two very iconic progressive rock albums would be realeased. One would be Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"", the other ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" by Yes. ""Dark Side"", a concept album about man's destructive qualities: (his wasting of time, his mental ills, his greed, etc). would be praised by critics, while ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"", a concept album about man's more positive qualities (his reverence of God, his respect for creation, and his wonderous ancient civilzations) would be spoken of rather harshly by the presses. I think that response says more about human nature than it does about the quality of the music on each of the records.  ""Tales"" isn't a perfect album, no, and it is a little stretched out at times, but when it's good (which is most of the time) it is a deeply evocative, beautiful piece of music, and a very special record, made all the more special by this re-release.  ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" was a two record release, made up of four 20 minute songs. For this album we have Jon Anderson is on vocals, Chris Squire on bass, Rick Wakeman on keyboards, Steve Howe on guitar and Alan White (formerly a session man for John Lennon & George Harrison) on drums. It's a concept album inspired by what Jon Anderson calls a ""lengthy footnote"" on page 83 of Paramhansa Yoganada's ""Autobiography of a Yogi"". The lyrics deal with origins and memories, the wonders of nature, possibilities, places long ago, places far away and rituals. Whether the concept is full and complete, I'm not really sure, but I do enjoy the ride.  It took me a few listens to get into this album. Actually, the first time I played I fell asleep on my desk halfway through ""The Revealing Science of God"". It's not that it's a boring, far from it. It's just that some parts are atmospherically sparse, and the tracks all go for a while, and for a first listen (or even a second or a third) it's a lot to take in. There's not as many of the intense moments as you'll find on other 20 minute tracks like ""Close to the Edge"" or ""The Gates of Delirium"" (for Relayer). It's not exactly low tempo, but it doesn't get too high too often either. There are weird moments (especially in ""The Ancient"") but for the most part, it all sounds pretty normal. ""It's typical Yes, just longer"" as one of my friends puts it. There is a little repetition, but it doesn't get too over top. Well, I don't think so anyway.  For me, this record is really special. I don't know what it is exactly, but something in the chords or the lyrics, or both, evokes something ancient. Like when you see archaeological relics in a mueseum, or when you look at a rugged cliff face, or pass a gnarled tree, or watch clouds billow out in the sky. Those moments that suggest something beyond, profound and distant. I'm sure Yes felt this about the songs too, if not intended it to evoke such things, judging from their choice of cover (a Roger Dean painting with rugged rocks and ancient monuments), and the photographs of various natural beauties underneath where the CDs sit (various skylines and cloudscapes, rushing water, etc).  Speaking of packaging, Rhino have done a great job with this repackaging. It's done like a mini-LP sleeve, which folds out revealing the discs. In one of the folds is a picture of a young Steve Howe, standing in front of a ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" billboard. The booklet, which you can find within between the fold with Steve & the billboard picture, has all the lyrics, a couple of pictures of the band, new liner notes by Mike Tiano describing the making of and controversy around the album, plus the original liner notes by Jon Anderson, describing the origins of the concept and a rough outline of the concept itself. The only problem I have with the packaging is that it doesn't fit on a standard CD rack. Agh! Ah well.  There's forty minutes of bonus tracks in the repackage too. That is, an alternate take each for two of the twenty minute tracks, ""The Revealing Science of God"" and ""The Ancient"". They are both early run throughs. A couple of the lyrics are different, but turn away from the stereo for a moment and you'll miss them. As they're run throughs, the productions a little more organic too (especially ""The Ancient""), and there aren't as many harmonies, and a lot of the familiar overdub parts aren't there. Jon Anderson's vocals are a little rough, and it used to put me off listening to these outtakes, but listening to them now, it's interesting hearing him striving, working things out. He's really passionate about the material, you can tell. There's a couple of extended parts in the songs too. The most notable part of these run throughs, I would say, is the version of ""Leaves of Green"" at the end of ""The Ancient"". Rather than having a Spanish guitar as backing, Steve Howe plays an electric guitar, and Alan White provides a jerky beat, in addition to hitting/shaking a really wobbly piece of percussion, sounding kind of comical against Jon's sincere lyrics.  It's a great album, and one worth getting for Yes fans, but pick up three or four of their other classic era records (like ""The Yes Album"", ""Fragile"", ""Close to the Edge"", ""Relayer"", or ""Going For the One"") before getting this one, just to get into what Yes are all about.

405,794210,A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B001G9FFHM,Chandler,False,"Earl ""40"" Stevens has been in the rap game for a long time now since his days when he formed The Click. From making timeless singles such as ""Sprinkle Me"" and ""Captain Save A Hoe"" back in the mid 90's. Back in 2006, he hooked up with Lil Jon who help create the hyphy movement with the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Ghetto-Report-Card/dp/B000ECX0UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Ghetto Report Card</a>, full of club ready material. What separated him from the rest of the Bay Area rappers who were on the hyphy movement was that 40 had rhymes, and showed that he was a veteran (in his forties I might add) and not an amateur in the rap game. Two years later he comes with his latest album Ball Street Journal, which sort of follows the same route as it's predecessor.  Not a whole lot has changed since his last album. It still has the hyphy sound that grew on me quite well here. Many tracks are easy standouts such as the opener ""The Ambassador"" (Rick Rock, you're a fool with those damn Digable Planets samples- see ""Yay Area"") and ""Tell It Like It Is"". The latter track shows 40's lyrical abilities over a Rick Rock bouncy track. 40 keeps up with The Game and Snoop Dogg on ""Pain No More"", another great track. Further down the album are tracks like ""Sliding Down The Pole"" thats well produced and features Oakland's own Too $hort. ""I Can Sell It"" featuring Cousin Fik is a clever song, thats well made. The final two tracks 40 colabs with family members B-Legit on the head nodding ""Alcoholism"". And at the end is the great ""Pray For Me"" featuring Bosko, B-Legit, and Suga-T (where has she been and when has she started singing, because she does a good job.)  Although many tracks are great, some of them just don't match the expectations that I had after coming from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Ghetto-Report-Card/dp/B000ECX0UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Ghetto Report Card</a>. Some of them lack quality as well as production (I know I wasn't a big fan of the lead single ""Wake It Up"" featuring Akon). The best tracks on here are when 40's lyrical abilities show, and doesn't concentrates on club tracks.  40's latest is dope. Some fans may not be happy with his hyphy movement style, and will question his quality of his music. If you're looking for a 2008 version of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-a-Major-Way/dp/B00000052I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In a Major Way</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tha-Hall-of-Game/dp/B000000541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tha Hall of Game</a>, you might want to stay away from this, because this will only anger further.

She has released an equally amazing album, which is the same ... yet very different. 'Huh?' your probably thinking by now. Let me explain. Once again this album explores Aimme's stories of failed relationships, disappointments in life, and folks who are just ready to blow town for a new start. But this CD is much more of a meditative and somber look at these ideals and themes.'ZZZZZZZZZ...'your probably thinking by now. Well nothing could be further from the truth. This album's look at more folks from Aimee's,'land of broken hearts and dreams' is just pure poetry. The songs just wear a hypnotic groove into your brain making them unforgettable. My favorite song on the album is ""This is How it Goes"".It is a melancholic look at the feelings drug addiction produces in a relationship. This song just has a slow languorous groove that just stays with you long after it's over. It is an effect that seems to run through many of these tunes. If you play these songs in the morning you'll probably still be hearing them in your head that night.

408,604791,A1ATUJY5GJNGCE,B000926SE6,Suetonius Paullinus,False,"I must apologise for that title. But in all seriousness this is an album that can't be missed. As we'd expect from Bruce's great solo record (the utterly timeless Chemical Wedding, brilliant Accident of Birth being the two predecessors to this album), Tyranny of Souls continues Bruce's solo successes.  Its not easy for a fan in Australia to get hold of these albums. Solo Bruce needs to be imported from overseas; the record shops are often unwilling to do it, and if they will they say 'Oh, it will be 6 to 8 weeks'. In short, Amazon is a lifesaver for any fan of non-mainstream music. I only just got my copy but it was well worth the wait, this is a great record  I'll tell you an interesting anecdote. I showed the album to my younger brother after saying 'just got Bruce Dickinson's latest solo album'. He said 'when did he find the time to do that?' I then thought about that and realised just how much Bruce has been doing since 1997's Accident of Birth. Think about it, we had AOB in 1997, Chemical Wedding in 1998, then Bruce went back to Maiden and recorded Brave New World (2000), did a MASSIVE tour, had some time off, recorded Dance of Death (2003), had another big tour, and then after all this he's managed to give us another solo album in 2005. That's about 5 albums in 7 years, plus touring. Not too shabby by any standard; compares VERY well to other artists of Bruce's age/generation. MEtallica, for example, having released load/reload (essentially the same material recorded mostly at the same time - they just 'polished' up the reload material after the load tour) in 1995/6, then did NOTHING for about 7 years when they released the dismal St Anger. (Live Albums (S&M) and Cover Albums (Garage Inc) don't count. So it took Metallica some 7 years to release a RUBBISH album, but Bruce manages to release 5 great to excellent albums in that time.  Given that Bruce has been VERY busy, has the quality suffered on Tyranny of Souls? Absolutely NOT, you wouldn't even know he'd been so busy that he had to record with Roy Z whenever he could at small intervals. Not only this, but apparently he really hurt his back and so could only sing for about 10 minutes and then had to lie down.  Now we turn to the album itself. Bruce doesn't pull any punches with this effort; he said himself he was worried about living up to the Chemical Wedding. While Tyranny of Souls doesn't equal or better that effort, (and who would reasonably expect it to?) it is a worthy successor, full of great music from Bruce.  Mars Within is a short intro that leads into the best track - Abduction. This is a blazing song with awesome lyrics and singing! Not to mention guitar work from Roy. Then comes 'soul intruders', another excellent track. We then get served the wonderful 'Kill Devil Hill'. A weird name, but a great track with an outro reminiscent of 'The Alchemist' from Chemical Wedding. We then get served a more laid back, calmer acoustic track 'Navigate the Seas of the Sun'. This is a great mood change and IMHO it is a beautiful song that showcases Bruce's excellent voice in a different style to his singing elsewhere.  Some have criticised the latter half of the album. I personally can find little fault with it. River of No Return has a great guitar riff and it works well. Power of the Sun is another excellent track. Devil on a Hog is a more 80's rocker in tempo at least, but it has some great vocals by Bruce that I can't fault. I love the vocal melody. 'You won't see my face no more, my machine has left the floor'  Believil comes next. THis is a very sombre track, I find it even a little scary...Bruce manages to sound almost evil when he sings it. It's probably my least favourite song on the CD but that's not to say it isn't still great. Finally the wonderful title track closes the album, with the first four lines stolen right from MacBeth (not a bad thing - MacBeth ROCKS).  Bruce doesn't sound tired or creatively spent, on the contrary he is positively inspired! This is an album DEFINITELY worth getting for your collection. If you like solo Bruce, (and you must or you wouldn't be here) then you HAVE to get this album.  While I do miss Adrian Smith, personally I don't think the album is much the worse without him. PErhaps he could have added an element that would have allowed it to equal the Chemical Wedding. PErhaps he wouldn't have made much difference. At any rate, the album is great notwithstanding.",5,"07 15, 2005",Go on....be ABDUCTED by Tyranny of Souls....haw haw haw,1121385600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},12.0,,timeless power manage say chemical unwilling macbeth st worthy soul rocker get wed thing expect accident different criticise song oh polish really tell turn predecessor right dickinson's calm river apologise pull serve rock kill contrary continue outro almost miss brother would bad worried he'd late work finally young lead release sound reload release plus maiden australia two record close without seriousness aob return example blaze dance hog compare small give count know punch lyric soul much effort think utterly like element vocal could evil four hold title can't nothing sings spend name within wait overseas definitely tyranny acoustic adrian good tour floor intro personally death love new make added material reminiscent worth amazon first line time live load/reload cd sun still voice see brilliant brave reasonably solo year bruce's albums need style since smith anger anecdote creatively manages give elsewhere he's latter success weird vocal i'll week hurt work sing positively say half think roy next least bad whenever change big tire hill must go intruder music interesting leave seas little face back rubbish quality showcases beautiful take allow sombre come equal perhaps mood metallica get mostly standard we'd artist tour alchemist fault garage shabby suffer steal tempo best notwithstanding awesome often import wonderful well non-mainstream say another difference bruce track apparently find interval load realise world show successor believil mar great minute navigate birth record lie lifesaver that's dismal rate devil favourite live singing probably shop collection machine copy full s&m album riff melody fan miss even easy guitar short massive lay cover mention excellent imho age/generation inspire essentially get busy inc scary...bruce abduction absolutely

410,970029,A18D87U8CUN0F9,B00DUUBCJ0,Jason Harrington,False,"Reviewing Earl is tricky for me, because first off I'm an old dude who probably should be listening to some dumb crap like Snow Patrol (puke), but I'm feeling this. I think Odd Future are maturing nicely, getting away from the rapey shock-rap that helped thrust them into the public eye, and moving toward something more clearly artistic. I like that their beats still have that sleepy/codeine feel to them. The main part that's hard for my generation to embrace is the new-school of rappers using a really flat or whiny delivery with content that is a mix of plainly stated emotion and repetitive attempts to coin certain phrasing.  Fortunately, Earl is the leader of the pack who raises the bar on all these tropes. I can recognize that a lot of people like the track with Frank Ocean, in the same way that a lot of people loved Super Rich Kids, but these are not my favorite parts of either album, because they just have a rawness to them with plain emo-rap type lyrics and a few awkward lines. Earl handles these pitfalls pretty well though, compared to dudes like Chance the Rapper (hate him), or the hyper-masculinity of ASAP Rocky (OK, but not for me), the punchy nasally flows of Danny Brown (I like him)...etc. Earl holds his own in the pantheon of swag-era, post-ringtone-rap, and manages to be mostly lyrical in a mostly post-lyrical rap landscape. Even at his most plain moments, he manages to infuse a certain level of detail, that is equal parts absurd, tough, and sensitive.  It's kind of weird when I hear something like Captain Murphy, which to me is a cheap (but mostly quality) knock-off of MF Doom, and then I hear Earl who also shows a clear influence from the Metal-fingered villain, but he adds something to that equation that doesn't seem as needlessly aggro (in the vocals) as Captain Murphy. Where Murphy bites both the wordplay and jazzy beat style of Doom, Earl continues to champion a more distinct beat niche that he shares with Tyler. There is much said about their rhyme content, but I feel like their beats don't get enough credit for maintaining that narcoleptic vintage drum machine and monophonic synth type sound. I am sure they make that sound on computers, but it doesn't have that over-quantized/over-mastered 16th beat Fruity-Loop trap sound that is the current staple of the majority of rap producers right now. Instead they created their own blend, mixing sort of a Wu-Tang-via-Eminem druggy quality with a bay-area-via-Pharell type minimalism, to come up with a hi-fi laptop version of sounds previously only possible through pushing vintage gear to it's limits on analog tape.  Most young rappers seem to pull from a very small pool of influences, and it's always been that way, until Odd Future came along. Earl especially, is one of those unique amalgams of artist who really has his ear to the streets and is aware of all the current trends, but who also seems to be extremely well-listened to a plethora of the rap niches that came before him and that exist both inside and outside of the ""mainstream"" (if we can even still use that term).  This is a very modest and consistent work, for an artist like this who seems to have so much going into and informing his work. The going trend now is to devalue your own work on purpose by over-saturating the market with free downloads full of cheap freestyles that repetitiously boast of never writing down lyrics, etc. Earl balances his nihilism and sensitivity in a way that avoids the extremes of either, to great success. Although I can't always turn on friends from my generation to Odd Future, Earl is the one young rapper who I think they should take the most time to consider.

417,676105,A3L9FT8OJY4Q6I,B000JFXTHW,Stuart Jefferson,True,"Eight discs-75,73,74,73,74,74,73,73-minutes each approximately.  The sound overall is good to very good.  There's a pleasant feeling of warmth in the mixes, that has transferred from the original vinyl from years ago.  Each disc is in a separate jewel case, and all the cases slip into a box, open at one end.  The box itself is either flimsy cardboard or heavy paper stock, depending on how you want to look at it.  There's no notes whatsoever except for a list of song titles, composer (s), time, and date, inside the paper title card for each disc.  Curiously, there's a list of artists on the bottom of the box-not the best place.  But this is the budget UK  version of this set that was released a while ago.  And the eight discs can still be purchased individually-but this is a better way to go if you're really interested in this music.  One good thing is this release has the correct takes of several songs, which in early releases used incorrect versions.  It's nice Warner/Rhino UK fixed the problem and owned up to it.  With music this great, where do you start?  This collection takes in a lot of fine music (from 1947-1974) that Atlantic Records released, not only to hopefully make some money, but also because the people who ran the company genuinely loved the music.  Atlantic was one of the labels that was a cornerstone of r&b for many years.  There were a number of other companies releasing r&b, but because this music was truly close to their musical hearts, they had more than their fair share of great artists for a number of years.  You can either skip around to your favorite artist/era, or sit down and listen to it chronologically (as I do), which gives a good feel for how the music morphed from greasy, hot, jumping, good time music, to a slightly more refined  sound over the years.  The era of this set brings in jazz, ""race"", be-bop, pure r&b, and soul musics, and gives a good look at how the music came to popularity in the bars on jukeboxes, on the radio, and then, in middle America's homes on 45rpm singles.  The long time fan/collector will recognize a number of songs that were popular/famous over the years, but it's the songs by artists like Joe Morris, Don Covay, Willis Jackson, and others that, for whatever reason, didn't receive a lot (if any) airplay on the radio, at least on a national level.  From hot, bouncing instrumentals (Frank Culley's ""Cole Slaw"", ""Gator's Groove"" by Willis Jackson for example), to more refined sounding arrangements (The Bobette's ""Mr. Lee"", ""The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face"" by Roberta Flack), this is a fine overview  from one of the best labels of the period.  A lot of well known artists are represented here-Ruth Brown, Professor Longhair, Joe Turner, Ray Charles, The Drifters, The Coasters, Ben E. King, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Aretha Franklin, and The Spinners-just to name a few.  Along with these come many lesser known artists-like Tiny Grimes, Stick McGhee, Joe Morris, Willis Jackson, Tommy Ridgley, The Cookies, Ivory Joe Hunter, The Mar-Keys, The Falcons, Chris Kenner, Esther Phillips, Barbara Lewis, Don Covay, Eddie Floyd, and Major Lance, and all deliver some very fine r&b, as well as give this set some depth.  This collection can, first and foremost, be enjoyed for the great music it contains.  But it can also be used as a gateway to more great music from these artists or, perhaps, others from other labels.  Any way you hear this collection, it's a fine set of r&b which belongs in anyone's library of great music.  This style of music was truly popular for about the same period (more or less)of this collection, before people moved on to something else.  With this set you can relive an important, exciting era of music in America.

427,1270447,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,B00009B8E1,Ian Muldoon,True,"Danged if I know what it is about the sound of the acoustic bass under the fingers of some - like Charles Mingus or Mr William Parker - but it has a power, attention getting lyricism, that rivets one's attention.  It may be the bass is closest to the rhythm of the heart or is synchronitic with atmospheric radio waves that move through the body, but it is very affecting. Mr Parker's solo on SUNDAY MORNING CHURCH is at once reverent and joyful and elegiac - a powerful moment.  Mr Parker's namesake - Charles - once opined that if you don't live it it won't come out of your horn. In the case of   Mr William Parker he is clearly a deeply thoughtful human in the way that John Coltrane was who saw music as life and a spiritual manifestation of one's thoughts and feelings. In looking back at aspects of his life Mr Parker writes about on SCRAPBOOK he has brought to us rituals of Sunday Church, the joy of gospel and the sense of belonging to a loving group, magic, resilience, pride and joy and the sense that this music speaks  to me like Wordsworth wished his poetry to be - a man speaking to men. It may well be Mr Bang's most affecting album I have heard. As a Viet Nam Vet he brings a different experience to the mix but  he displays a powerful lyricism and deep feeling. I found his playing of the repetitive melody on SCRAPBOOK quite moving. Mr Drake is everywhere brilliant.

428,1273045,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0000ADYBG,General Zombie,False,"Though At the Gates would eventually gain their fame watering down and mainstreaming death metal, a mere three years early they were at the vanguard of progressively-minded bands bent on expanding the boundaries of the genre. While their countrymen Entombed, Dismember and Unleashed emphasized a brute, relatively simplistic beatdown, AtG's debut ""The Red in the Sky is Ours"" is a lithe, sophisticated and melodic piece of technically-adept death metal that suggests the Florida prog-death scene far more than the buzzsaw sounds of Sweden. While critics will invariably describe ""Red"" as ""immature,"" others will say AtG possessed a skill and ambition beyond either their individual ages or that of the youthful genre. Innovative though it is ""Red"" is not an album that was ahead of its time, but rather one that predicted an alternate future, where ""melodic death metal"" meant sophisticated DM with a strong melodic element, rather than the power-thrash with growled vocals that dominated the Gothenburg scene in the late 90s. It's a tragedy that both AtG and the subgenre as a whole took a different path (which isn't to say that all or even most melodeath is bad), but with ""Red"" we have a glimpse into what might've been, and a terrific, immensely enjoyable album.  Though many have complained about the production, the relatively distant, bass-light sound allows the elaborate guitarwork to shine through in one of the finest dual guitar performances in all of death metal. Svensson and Bjorler display a remarkably intuitive interplay, moving from lockstep riffing to simple harmonies to elaborate counterpoint and back with astonishing ease. Varied though they can be, the duo are quite adept a pure riff monsters, as in the title track and ""Night Comes, Blood Black"" the ferocious bookends of the original material. While their work is not as overtly technical as much later, conventional tech-death, their material is sufficiently elaborate and precise for most guitar geeks, and they display a melodic sense unparalleled in later tech death. (See the gorgeous harmonies and melodies of ""Windows"" and ""Through Gardens of Grief"" and other tracks, with an assist to Jesper's surprising but always effective violin.) The rhythm section is less well represented, particularly the largely inaudible bass, but Erlandsson's drums add rhythmic punch to the album, and they all ably navigate the complicated rhythms. (See ""Night Comes, Blood Black"" for probably the toughest, shiftiest rhythms on the album.)  Individually strong performances don't mean much unless the pieces build to something larger, and here AtG consistently succeed once again. ""Red"" is a remarkably consistent release for a debut, and even the weaker tracks (""Claws of Laughter Dead"" and ""Within"") are more than worth the listener's time. Most significantly, AtG find that rare balance between technicality and memorability that makes the tracks rewarding both immediately and on careful listen. All this culminates in some truly masterful compositions, particularly the explosively dynamic and melodic ""Neverwhere"" (the album's masterpiece) and ""Kingdom Gone,"" both of which throw a few nice vocal hooks into the mix. (Moreover, AtG briefly step out of the DM norm with the remarkably beautiful interlude ""The Scar,"" a rare example of the brief interlude that is absolutely worth listening to.)  All in all, ""The Red in the Sky is Ours"" is one of the most underappreciated death metal albums ever recorded. Melodeath fans may not care for the album's oft inscrutable nature, while tech-heads may well have written off AtG as an enjoyable but hardly remarkable band after hearing ""Slaughter of the Soul.""

430,997270,A6Y3K7L1FRWP3,B00HSCDX70,farington,False,"When the DVD of the Isle of Wight concert came out and I got to hear what Miles' group of this era sounded like in a concert setting start to finish, it was a revelation.  Teo Macero's cut-and-splice editing may have been a good thing for giving structure to the studio recordings, where Miles and the band would play for hours, generating ""raw material"". But it seemed like too much when applied to live performances because they were tighter and had a structure of their own borne out of the moment of the performance.  Anyway, after watching the Isle of Wight concert I wished for unedited versions of the Fillmore East recordings so I could have the same experience with them that I'd had with the Isle of Wight show.  Finaly, here they are, and they don't disappoint.  It's going to take a while for me to actually ""hear"" what the band did because I've gotten accustomed to expecting Macero's cuts and edits from all the hours I listened to the original double-album version.  But there's a lot of new material here, especially the playing of Steve Grossman, and the whole package is good enough to deserve new hours of ""re-hearing"" the music.  As far as the sound, it seems a bit thinner than the original--that may be because it doesn't have any room ambience, which makes me think the ambience on the original album was a special effect put in by Macero.  One added bonus, there's a fold-out concert poster included, which is kind of funny because it reminds me of all the rock albums from the late '60s that included posters--but on the back it has reprints of 1970 articles about Miles from Rolling Stone and Newsweek.

One thing is apparent here...the samplefest of THE GLOBE is over. This record is more basic rock with just a sprinkling of samples. It's also less immediately hooky than THE GLOBE.  The problem with it is that it seems Jones and company are rudderless here. They can't decide if this is back to basics rock...or still ""cutting edge"" keyboard infused alterna-jams.  HIGHLIGHTS: ""Singapore"" was B.A.D.'s comment on the caning of Michael Fay (Fay was an American college student who was caned by Singapore authorities after being convicted for vandalizing cars while he was visiting that country.) which made world news at the time. There's a slightly cheesy element to ""Push Those Blues Away"" (sorta like an early 90s ""Steal my Sunshine"") but it's fairly catchy. A hidden track cover of David Bowie's ""Suffragette City"" (after ""What About Love?"") is decent though it won't replace Bowie's. ""Gonna Try"" is a pretty basic alt-love song. ""It's a Jungle Out There"" has an off-kilter hookiness that settles in a bit over time.  LOWS: ""What About Love?"" is a horrible lyric. It looks like it wanted to be a song about the vacuum inside modern youth but it just had too many insipid lines like ""I'm schizophrenic manic depressive/Kids of today surely are aggressive/An alca/shoppa/workaholic/Most the music's really chronic"". ""I Turned Out a Punk"" is as removed from the stripped raw energy that is punk music as, say, Mantovani. It's aggressively bland. ""Vitamin C"" is a pretty witty broadside against the culture that tries to synthetically replace the essential nutrients we fail to put in our diet (""Didn't used to eat so I'd take these...Guess I must be unhealthy..Have you got the time release please?"") but the ""gimme 'nother hit of Vitamin C"" is so relentless that you begin to hope someone will lace Mick's pills with cyanide. ""Got to Set Her Free"" almost sounds like a lost Smokey Robinson track (without the falsetto vocal).

437,144040,A1C2FD1DZKR4W0,B000002GF6,J. HARMON,True,"KILROY WAS HERE...  The album has toiled under the weight of its results. The band, which had irreparably fractured 4 years earlier, fell apart ""with one finger up in the air."" Intractable as the feelings were then, the legacy has remained as staunchly overwrought. The end result is that the greatness of this album actually being less than the sum of its parts.  KILROY WAS HERE was not actually the album that destroyed the band. CORNERSTONE owns that dubious distinction for it was the first album in which the band wrote songs and arranged them as the writers deemed fit. It was the first album in which all band members did not assist in the creation and arrangement of the songs. To a large degree Cornerstone became the first in a devolving process where in STYX fell from being a band to being a collection of 5 remarkably talented musicians performing as solo artists under the bands name. KLIROY WAS HERE was the climax (or anti-climax if you wish) of that disintegration of the once incredible band STYX.  KILROY WAS HERE might have been a truly great album if Dennis DeYoung would have released it as a solo album or even under a pseudonym. There are several incredibly wonderful songs on this album, JUST GET THROUGH THIS NIGHT and HAVEN'T WE BEEN HERE BEFORE stand the test of time as being among the most beautiful and soulful of STYX songs to have ever graced a disc. COLD WAR and DON'T LET IT END could have found themselves on any STYX album and not have been out of place (albeit with some better cohesiveness among band members in the arrangements.) I would argue that the guitar work and vocals are better than on most of the tracks on PARADISE THEATRE.  A few of the songs are just silly. While the concept was valiant, the remainder of the band was not heartfelt in their support and it showed in the lack of creativity and instrumentation throughout the individual tracks. Very little of Dennis DeYoungs' or James Youngs' songs seemed unique or complex in their structuring or instrumentation (not unlike some of the tracks from CORNERSTONE.)  During STYX halcyon days, each of the bands five members contributed more than their two cents worth as they chiseled out the songs. This method was brought back during the recording of the brilliant CYCLORAMA album. However, a prolonged rhythm bridge was never introduced or a chorus from a previously penned song was never suggested, let alone melded into the final master tape which was released as KILROY WAS HERE.  STYX was known for such an ethereal harmony, played with incredible meticulousness, that was almost unmatched within the annals of rock and roll. Not even YES (while instrumentally superior) could match the soulfulness of the songwriting and vocal talents of STYX. STYX was a band of such mesmerizing sound and unity that Jack Black (who holds the band in unmatched reverence) once stated that it would be impossible for him to imagine playing with because of the sound being ""too magical."" But, as the band broke apart, the songs suffered.  KILROY WAS HERE, as an album, suffered the most. Had Dennis DeYoung wrote and recorded the album as a solo project, who knows how history might have remembered the album? Had Tommy and the band continued, who can argue that STYX would have regained its lost magic? The album became a microcosm of the band itself... immense talent, incredible potential, all lost under the weight of self-centered, egotistical and misguided totalitarianism imposed upon a rebellious minded population that surrendered to the control of the despot and ultimately imploded. We can only thank Johnathan Chance for standing up against the tyranny and fueling the opportunity for the band members to escape, with the footsteps ultimately leading down to the re-structured STYX of today.  And lest we never forget, if the songs were as bad as some would like to remember, the strong minded band members would have protested sufficiently to have insured that the songs would not have been recorded. JY, Chuck, John and even Tommy found enough to add their contributions without too much protest (let alone firing Dennis DeYoung). And STYX today does offer snippets of plaudits to the album every now and then within their concerts and even their studio recordings. [Tommy Shaw had a picture of a ROBOTO mask within the liner notes of his heralded 1998 solo album 7 DEADLY ZENS, and STYX included numerous samples from KILROY WAS HERE within the 1999 BRAVE NEW WORLD album.)  In summation, KILROY WAS HERE, albeit much maligned (and deservedly so) is still a great album filled with great songs performed by great musicians... KILROY WAS HERE, however, cannot be regarded as a great STYX album, as the band was torn asunder as far back as 1979.

The first track, Reckoning Day, is my favorite off this album. Very catchy song with lyrics that proves Megadeth isn't all about death and other such things. Train of Consequences is very catchy, but it starts to annoy me after a while, so I'd say limit your dosage on that track.  As much as I like to appreciate the lesser known tracks off an album, there's no denying that A Tout le Monde is completely amazing. Best lyrics on the album right there. Killing Road is arguably the heaviest song on here with its opening bass and guitar work, and it is also one of the catchiest. In truth, the only two tracks I really skip often are Elysian Fields (starts good but falls apart) and Black Curtains (I always seem to tune it out when listening so I guess its just boring, though I will note it has a nice solo).  Victory is a commercial song, but it's one of my favorites. Starts fast ends faster. Lots of solos. I feel that Youthanasia as a song is severely underrated. The drums are absolutely amazing, and who can skip it with the shredding solos?  The bonus tracks on this one are better than on a lot of the remasters. Millennium of the Blind isn't too special, but Mustaine sounds awesome and there's a few demon-speed solos in the middle. New World Order is forgetable but still solid, and Absolution contains a riff/mini-solo that was included in the song Trust off of Cryptic Writings. The A Tout le Monde demo was surprisingly enjoyable and easily the best bonus track. Not better than the finished version but good in a different way. It has a unique solo done with some sort of woodwind instrument, and it also sounds very raw, which in my opinion is a good thing.  Overall, a great album that all Countdown fans will enjoy. It's not a Countdown beater, but I would say it has the best vocals of any Deth album.",5,"05 1, 2006",Very much like Countdown.,1146441600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,fall drum track nice lyric le tune black much mustaine work youthanasia enjoy arguably way megadeth like order vocal skip start deth know world handful completely guess curtain apart lot enjoyable demon-speed favorite thing i'd open catchy limit solid great cryptic different unique amaze heavy song feel bass fan train contains beater well millennium middle severely surprisingly faster gems thing underrate really pair prove one include death elysian series lot new less right solo bonus favorites sound good monde bore first commercial trust listen version sort deny album would raw truth throw track also shred forgetable annoy end still field easily solo fast day opinion road guitar dosage demo writing appreciate absolution catchy special best reckon two awesome often remasters overall finish countdown instrument tout though seem consequence there's always say victory note blind riff/mini-solo do woodwind absolutely kill

A beautiful day, and I was walking down the street listening to this album for the first time on my CD player, when I heard them sing: ""Another sunny afternoon / walkin' to the sound of my favorite tune..."" - and, in that final multiplication of weirdness, that song, Morning Glory, did soon after become one of my favorites as I fell hard for this incredible album.  (What's the Story) Morning Glory? is an expression of raw musical talent. The songs are loud, direct and unapologetic; the lyrics are ambiguous, but sung with real feeling. The tone shifts from the sunny Hey Now! and hard-driving, almost fierce Morning Glory to the more introspective Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova, but even in its introspection, (What's the Story) is loud, direct and unapologetic. She's Electric, the only comical song (and pretty darn funny too), somehow doesn't break the mood.  Wonderwall, of course, is - Wonderwall. You could buy the album just for that song alone. When I think about it, though, I sometimes forget Wonderwall is even on here, the same way the rest of Talking Heads' Remain in Light shines seperately from Once in a Lifetime. Wonderwall in (What's the Story) is like the star on top of a Christmas Tree.  It's hard to compare Oasis with any other band from their era - at least, any other good one. Blur was more cerebral and affected, Suede was more sensual, and Morrissey's solo career was in transition. Whether or not Oasis was _better_ than any of those acts is a matter of opinion, but their broad appeal certainly doesn't make them any worse, either. Personally I think they had something many of those other acts lacked, a kind of sincerity. There's something about that old-fashioned brand of rock - songs that just wear well, that bear listening over and over, chorus after ecstatic chorus.",5,"02 4, 2005","""I'm not sure what I think about that greeting...""",1107475200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},19.0,,player feel lyric old-fashioned tune hard comical oasis fierce rock star act break way darn sing like career blur song could hear street moment think fell least wear favorite bad many expression certainly something direct sung musical ecstatic song real good introspection cerebral brand shift affect morrissey's course ambiguous one introspective personally broad appeal morning walk funny unapologetic electric odd beautiful favorite soon wonderwall compare champagne loud good kind tree suede become talk first weirdness whether light almost alone listen remain transition time mood album afternoon hard-driving raw what's lifetime top multiplication hey glory sometimes buy cd bear somehow even band matter solo rest seperately day opinion talent sound incredible make shine walkin head either christmas sunny forget chorus story sensual though lacked there's tone well sincerity another final supernova era pretty

It is admirable:  It works well as a sampler; it adds to the experience with archival recordings that contrast from some of the originals; and it 'Documents' their growth and progression from their roots as a Southern college art band that helped create alternative rock before it became a word.  The selections are fine, but they don't totally mesh together like their albums, and, though they don't spoil additional purchases for their original albums (which this reviewer believes are the best series since the Beatles) it doesn't flow or coalesce as well as their Warner Brothers' collection 'In Time, 1988-2003'.  Specifically, the punkier version of ""Radio Free Europe"" does ""squish the [other] recording like a grape,"" as bassist Mike Mills renders it, but it doesn't make the 'Murmur' album version extraneous, either.  All of the rest of the songs show a versatality these perfectionists mastered, including folk-rock ""Talk About the Passion"", New Wave (""Gardening at Night""), country-accented rock (""Don't Go Back to Rockville""), and, even jazzy music with guitar that has the trajectory of the Ramones (""Can't Get There from Here"").

Secondly, it is an iconic ""English"" work steeped in years of British tradition being conducted by a German. Most of this performance is unusually slow. I was a student of Richard Standen, the Bass on this recording and one summer, was in his home with three other students. We heard the recit and aria For Behold, Darkness and The people that walked in darkness. I asked how he managed to breath through the painfully long phrases and the response was,""With great difficulty"". Mr. Standen went on to tell us that a number of years later he was engaged for another recording of Messiah with Scherchen, and prepared for the long phrases by walking long distances, breathing in slowly for 18 paces, holding for 10 and breathing out over 18. On the first day back in the studio, he proudly announced to Scherchen that he was prepared this time. Scherchen smiled and said, ""Oh it's O.K. I have re thought it"". Scherchen regarded himself as something of an acoustician, so dynamics in the chorus work are at times a bit strange, probably because of microphone placement. The tenor is a bit unsubtle, the Alto somewhat hooty and the soprano sounds as if she would be more at home in Wagner. The second recording with Scherchen is a much more enjoyable set, not only for the tempi, but also for the casting which includes, Richard Standen again along with Pierrete Alarie, Nan Merriman and Leopold Simoneau",3,"12 16, 2011",Slow but Interesting,1323993600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},3.0,,"second recording steep acoustician o.k manage much unusually richard was,""with thought performance breath work proudly aria somewhat microphone say distance slow phrase hear mr conduct recit time enjoyable tradition prepare thing pierrete secondly unsubtle something great later ask placement oh bass wagner go long merriman student student one tell back slowly standen walk behold engage tempi hold painfully sound home leopold english strange probably regard first bit alto soprano number studio simoneau listen time difficulty would hooty mono tenor also messiah response smile dynamic iconic day year cast summer walk breathe darkness chorus set nan old along german include alarie people pace british note three another scherchen announce rather"

472,526831,A3FOJX953FO0R8,B00008OWZC,Jacko Monteo,False,"For years, Led Zeppelin fans complained that there was one missing item in the group's catalog: a good live album. It's not that there weren't live albums to be had. The Song Remains the Same, of course, was a soundtrack of a live performance, but it was a choppy, uneven performance, lacking the majesty of the group at its peak. BBC Sessions was an excellent, comprehensive double-disc set of their live radio sessions, necessary for any Zeppelin collection (particularly because it contained three songs, all covers, never recorded anywhere else), but some carped that the music suffered from not being taped in front of a large audience, which is how they built their legacy -- or, in the parlance of this triple-disc collection of previously unreleased live recordings compiled by Jimmy Page, How the West Was Won. The West in this case is the West Coast of California, since this contains selections from two 1972 concerts in Los Angeles: a show at the LA Forum on June 25, and one two days later at Long Beach Arena. This is the first archival release of live recordings of Zeppelin at their peak and while the wait has been nigh on interminable, the end result is certainly worth the wait. Both of these shows have been heavily bootlegged for years and while those same bootleggers may be frustrated by the sequencing that swaps the two shows interchangeably (they always prefer full shows wherever possible), by picking the best of the two nights, Page has assembled a killer live album that captures the full, majestic sweep of Zeppelin at their glorious peak. And, make no mistake, he tries to shove everything into these three discs -- tight, furious blasts of energy; gonzo freak-outs; blues; and rock, a sparkling acoustic set. Like always, the very long numbers -- the 25-minute ""Dazed and Confused,"" the 23-minute ""Whole Lotta Love,"" the 19-minute ""Moby Dick"" -- are alternately fascinating and indulgent, yet even when they meander, there is a real sense of grandeur, achieving a cinematic scale attempted by few of their peers (certainly no other hard rock or metal band could be this grand; only Queen or David Bowie truly attempted this). But the real power of the band comes through on the shorter songs, where their sound is distilled to its essence. In the studio, Zeppelin was all about subtle colors, textures, and shifts in the arrangement. On-stage, they were similarly epic, but they were looser, wilder, and hit harder; witness how ""Black Dog"" goes straight for the gut here, while the studio version escalates into a veritable guitar army -- it's the same song, but the song has not remained the same. That's the case throughout How the West Was Won, where songs that have grown overly familiar through years of play seem fresh and new because of these vigorous, muscular performances. For those who never got to see Zeppelin live, this -- or its accompanying two-DVD video set -- is as close as they'll ever get. For those who did see them live, this is a priceless souvenir. For either group, this is absolutely essential, as it is for anybody who really loves hard rock & roll.

473,722413,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B000YKE87W,G P Padillo,True,"I've taken a different - or at least partially opposing point of view regarding this album than a number of my friends.  Initially, I, must admit I was slightly disappointed, expecting something more . . . but it is fast (very fast) growing on me.  I have to laugh at some public forum comments on this artist as being ""Male Netrebko.""  Most early major label recordings of any artist always feature them in too familiar works pitting them against the memories (real or imagined) of one's favorite singers and the incomparable manner in which they sang such chestnuts.  However, the fact remains that Kaufmann is actually singing some of these roles and I think, ultimately for both voice and career, he is being absolutely wise in his choice of repertoire and keeping the voice flexible, fresh and free.  What a Tannhauser he will make with that sound.  Ditto Parsifal, Lohengrin and . . . well, I'm jumping ahead of myself.  The primary reason I think this album is growing on me, however, is that I absolutely LOVE the rather considerable contrast he brings to roles when compared to more ""typical"" Rodolfos, Fausts, des Grieuxs, Marios and Alfredos.  We're living in a magical time for light/lyric tenors but, even despite their distinct sounds and interpretations, they prove to have more uniform timbres presenting less wholly original dramatic spectrum in these roles.  I love the individual stamp that any singer can bring to these roles and for that reason am thrilled that as fine and intelligent singer as Herr Kaufmann is he seems to invest something unusual into each of his assignments.  For this alone, he rises to the top of the current ""youngish"" brood.  (For something truly wonderful check out the youtubes of Kaufmann in some of his operetta selections.  Wunderbar!)  To these ears, his French and Italian sound fine, if a bit more idiosyncratic than idiomatic.  Unlike other reviewers, however, I don't think this is due so much to his accenting these languages in a native German voice, but rather resulting from his naturally darkish hue as well as the substantial weightiness of his voice.  In these Italian and lighter French selections, I have come to adore the sound of this voice - as well as the odd mixture of ease and intensity that seems to come through everything he interprets.  Kaufmann's Rodolfo sounds a bit meatier than we've grown accustomed to - and remains the least successful aria on the  album.  Still, I'm glad to have it as it's aurally intriguing and the likelihood of a studio Boheme with Kaufmann is less than nil, future generations wondering what he might have sounded like get to hear, and (most likely) grateful he ultimately took his considerable gifts into another direction.  Still, I can never get enough of good singers trying their voices out in fachs not distinctly their own, even for the sheer ""curiosity shop"" factor of it all.  Kaufmann is no less ""curious"" to me.  Soon enough will he be excelling as Parsifal, Lohengrin, and other heroic German roles.  I'd love to see/hear him as Max in Freischutz, and some other of the Webber arias that just don't get aired enough.  Having Kaufmann in them could probably guarantee some interesting less frequently repertoire choices would sell some seats.  I loved his turn in the new Fierrabras - though the production itself often drove me crazy.  What the hell, I  also want to hear this guy as Peter Grimes - - even if it comes  off as (as Sills used to imitate Koussivetsky) ""Paeter und Greimez.""

475,603656,A2PAD826IH1HFE,B00081TXTA,J Scott Morrison,False,"The premi&egrave;re of Mahler's Fifth Symphony took place in Cologne on October 18 1904. This performance at the Lucerne Festival took place almost precisely one hundred years later in August 2004. The music is as  fresh as if it had been written yesterday. I had some mixed feelings about Abbado's audio recording of the Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic (although it gains something in its newish release on SACD) but I have no reservations about this live performance with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra. First, a word about this orchestra. It has some orchestral superstars amongst its participants. Just look at some of the principals: Kolja Blacher, concertmaster; Wolfram Christ, principal viola; Franz Bartolomey and the fabulous Natalia Gutman, cello first desk; Alois Posch, contrabass; the Hagen Quartet in the sections, along with a couple from the Alban Berg Quartet; Jacques Zoon, flute; Albrecht Mayer, oboe; Sabine Meyer, clarinet, along with members of her Wind Ensemble (Bl&auml;serensemble); Stefan Schweigert, bassoon; Stefan Dohr, principal horn (he plays stunningly); Reinhold Friedrich, trumpet (he does, too); Mark Templeton, trombone. Wow! What a lineup! If you follow orchestral musicians you know this is very nearly the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me.  None of that would make a lot of difference if Abbado's direction was not  distinguished. But it is. He molds every phrase precisely, clearly has thought and rethought his interpretation of this masterpiece, and he wrings all the drama, pathos, tenderness, heroism etc. from it. Rhythm and line are not sacrificed to overprecise nuance. Warmth and humanity are not diminished by attention to architectural detail. The first three movements have more dramatic edge that Abbado's earlier Berlin recording. The Adagietto is supremely beautiful but it does not dawdle (8:33) and thus become a dirge as is so often the case. It is, after all, a love song. The strings are simply fabulous throughout, with body and sheen aplenty, and plenty of bite in the dramatic and anguished moments.  There are other DVDs of Mahler's Fifth. I've not seen Barenboim's but am very fond of Rattle's with the Berlin. I like that performance but don't like the accompanying piece, Thomas Ad&egrave;s's 'Asyla,' for what that's worth. As far as audio recordings are concerned I'm extremely fond of Tennstedt with the London Philharmonic (only available, I think, these days in a budget twofer with the 'Lied von der Erde' with Agnes Baltsa and Klaus Konig, and not one of my favorites of that work) and of Barbirolli's, a little less so of Karajan's with the BPO. I tell you of my favorites on audio CD so you'll have an idea of what I tend to like. If they match your preferences, then you'll probably like this performance.  There is the usual video, but also a 'conductor's angle' (with the camera trained on Abbado from the orchestra player's perspective) available on this DVD.

Coombs,False,"I really like these performances and I feel this whole series stands up well by comparison to the others, such as the old NYP Bernstein out there. What is interesting is that Gilbert seems in tune with the bleak, somewhat ""chilly"" nature of the opening to the Fifth. Gilbert and the NYP then bring out the beauty of Nielsen's vision in the first movement until the famed snare-drum cadenza grabs your attention. The rest of the piece is performed brilliantly though maybe not as urgently or violently as some reviewers would like. I enjoyed Gilbert's pace however. The 6th Symphony is a notoriously tricky work and hard to ""decipher"". This was apparently written at a time when the composer was a bit depressed and already suffering from the heart condition that would eventually kill him. Nearly everything about this ""Sinfonia semplice"" is neither ""simple"" not very ""symphony"" like. Gilbert's reading seems to emphasize the unconventional approach that Nielsen was noted for and makes a great deal of the irony that comes from the composer's irony and forced humor in what is basically a very pathetic framework. I like this whole series a great deal. We know now that Alan Gilbert will believing the Philharmonic at the end of his contract. I sure don't know all the back story but most conductors of the major orchestras leave a ""legacy"" series of recordings, somewhat like the Solti Mahler series.

His third album, ""Hurricane"" adds credence to my previous statement.  That is one of my top twenty-five albums of all-time.  Fast forward to this album, ""Love & Life.""  Well, I just finished listening to it and, as a unit, I am disappointed with this album.  Don't misinterpret me because it's not a bad album, but I know his capabilities and he surely did not reach his potential with this album.  It's a good LP, but there is nothing groundbreaking nor is this album as consistent as ""True to Myself"", ""A Day in the Life"" and ""Hurricane.""  Needless to say, this is his weakest work to date.   I once heard that record companies release the best songs to radio.  Well, ""Love and Life's"" first release, ""You're the Only One"" is definitely the most memorable song out of the twelve tracks.  This song is very catchy and sincere.  Benet catches his listeners off guard by hitting some great falsetto notes towards the song's end.  I look forward to hearing those notes each time the song comes on.  This album is much more upbeat than ""Hurricane""; it has an overall happier tone.  ""Chocolate Legs"" is the other standout track here.  Benet effortlessly croons all throughout the song.  He sounds great here, also.  In this song, Benet is telling a woman to wrap her chocolate legs around him.  It's a very romantic number.  ""Spanish Fly"" and ""Still I Believe"" are the album's biggest missteps.

492,573588,A3MXSVN5YDYGXN,B00029MM5U,M.D.,False,"Rev. Horton Heat is one of my favorite artists for many reasons, so I can't help but expect a lot out of any album, and I do my best to egg him on in any direction he goes off into with each release. I defend almost every one of his records(Space Heater is hard to muster up a good defense for) when someone dogs his music, but I really, really like this record. I bought it the first day it was released and eagerly popped it in. I don't like to admit that it took me a while to get into his last two releases(Night in the Box and Lucky Seven), and I still like his first few albums more, but I immediately loved this record. His return to Deep Ellum, the death of his mother, the producing of Ed Stasium?- I don't know why he wised up, but I loved what the Rev did. The effort to make it as live as possible with a miniscule amount of overdubs enchants me to think about while I'm listening to it. I'm glad he let go of his odd fascination with Jimbo songs to make room for some other stuff. ""We belong Forever"" and ""Someone in Heaven"" are incredible, and have turned many of my friends heads who gave up on the Rev. after Space Heater, impressed to hear that his peaceful, introspective style works so well. ""The Happy Camper"" is a wonderful instrumental that sets the tone. And call me crazy, but I'm a sucker for the simple rowdy country tunes like 'Rumble Strip','Honky Tonk Girl' and'Party Mad'. The stripped down style works for me, but I understand people's plight who are frustrated at this less aggressive album; However, you're just nuts if you liked the Rev. before and don't like ""Indigo Friends"". I for one have felt confused listening to parts of the Rev's past releases(and ""Pet Rock"" is the only song that makes me feel this way on this album; Although ""Octopus Mode"" gets kinda close), as if he was trying to find a way to mix his loud side, his jazzy influences, and his country and rockabilly background(That hasn't stopped me from listening to every album relentlessly).

They always put on a great and humble live show. It is so hard to review Casting Crowns as much of their music inspires people and gives them hope. Musically, I was disappointed with their last album, UNTIL THE WHOLE WORLD HEARS, because the songs were just so slow and dull compared to last efforts. While a song can be slow and touching (Praise You In This Storm), an entire album of mostly slow tempo songs is hard to be drawn into. COME TO THE WELL is yet another disappointing effort.  The opening song, as with all of their albums, is a strong, challenging song and it draws you in. But as with the last album, they go into a string of slow tempo songs that, despite the good lyrics, fail to draw me in. When they do have a more up tempo song (MY OWN WORST ENEMY), then the lyrics are not inspiring.  Again, as with the last album, we are really lacking on The Crowns trademark of ""challenging"" songs. We have COURAGEOUS, but after that, we don't have the others that sneak up on you like SLOW FADE and the like. This may be the new Casting Crowns: slow tempo worship and praise music.  There is nice stuff on this album. I like JUST ANOTHER BIRTHDAY, THE WELL, JESUS, FRIEND OF SINNERS and the opening track. But it is almost like anyone can write these songs...what drew me into Casting Crowns were songs that challenged us mixed with praise songs and often with upbeat music. Musically, I just feel that they are meandering around. I don't think they should always sound like the first album but they've been unable to match the eclectic sound of the first album and hitting is hard with challenging themes like in WHAT IF HIS PEOPLE PRAYED, IF WE ARE THE BODY, AMERICAN DREAM, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, SLOW FADE, THE ALTAR AND THE DOOR and the other songs that would often shake us out of our comfort zone and challenge us. The new album tries to do that on a few songs but really lack the power of these past songs. I just wish and hope they return to keeping us on our toes.  To their credit, the new songs play much better live than they do on this album. And when listening to a random play of Casting Crowns, these songs may mix well.

504,812423,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B001VRDRGA,Allen Smalling,False,"Nineteen-sixty was still part of the Golden Age of musicals.  Off-Broadway gave us the legendary FANTASTICKS, which is still running, also the incomparable CAMELOT.  But it was an amiable satire about an Elvis-like rock-and-roller about to be drafted into the Army that is the most revived, a favorite among small-theater groups and high-schoolers alike, this BYE BYE BIRDIE.  While BYE BYE BIRDIE is a satire of a rock-and-roller, it's not really a satire of rock-and-roll music; the only song in that vein would be ""Honestly Sincere.""  Better remembered are the jazzy ""I've Got a Lot of Livin' to Do"" and even moreso, the upbeat ""Put on a Happy Face.""  Keep an ear out for the satirical line through the show, as would-be songwriter Albert Peterson and his gal Rosie sing out of both sides of their mounts in relating Conrad Birdie's background to the press:  ""He was born in Indochina, son of missionaries there"" sings one, ""He was born in old Virginny"" and rich, sings the other, spnning the Press every which way.  As much as I enjoy the 1963 film musical based on this hit, I prefer this original, in which the social satire extends to Albert's girl friend, Rosa Alvarez (Chita Rivera), who was WASP-ified into Janet Leigh as ""Rose de Leon"" for the movie.  The take-off on teen life in little Sweet Apple, Ohio, is evident in ""The Telephone Hour,"" which choreographer Gower Champion cleverly staged in pastel boxes with the high-schoolers speaking over pastel Princess phones, a trope that has held up today.  BYE BYE BIRDIE is a fine and significant musical and this CD come at a good price.

505,267886,A15RCR0Z06P7Y8,B0000033E5,K. Curley,False,"Following hot on the heels of the stunning 'Birds And Bees And Monkees' boxed set, Rhino Handmade gives us the same treatment for the Monkees 1968 soundtrack album 'Head'.  I have to say when I found out about this I was floored, and ordered it ASAP.  To me, ANY Monkees deluxe album is a must-have, and I was still basking in the glow of the 'Birds And Bees' set.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  While I won't say that this set is bad, it does fall a long way short of its predecessor.  For one thing there's just not that much material to work with.  'Head' only featured seven actual songs, and tracks that might have been considered for the film (such as 'War Games') already appeared on the 'Birds And Bees' collection.  Not that this seemed to matter - one of the tracks on 'Head', an alternate mix of 'Do I Have To Do This All Over Again' - is the same recording that was just used on the 'Birds And Bees' set.  Not only that, but many of the other tracks here have been issued already as parts of other Monkees collections.  It's nice to have them all in one place, but still...  In addition the track 'California Here It Comes' appears, even though it was from the Monkees '33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee' TV special.  Interestingly, it is presented here in a slightly different mix (missing the skipping effect at the end).  This gives hope that maybe Rhino has found at least some tapes from that special, even if they are only in mono.  This brings me to what I feel is a missed opportunity here: why not include the soundtrack for the entire '33 1/3' as disc 3?  While the open end interview with Davy about the 'Head' film is no doubt a rarity even a rabid fan like me must face the fact that now that I have played it I'm not likely to give it too many listens.  I WOULD play the '33 1/3' soundtrack though, even if (like I said) most or all the tracks were ripped directly from the soundtrack.  I'm sure with current technology Rhino could do a bang-up job!  However, I don't want to give the impression that this set is not worthwhile (just maybe not worth the price tag).  One of the highlights for me was the unreleased rough mono mix of 'Porpoise Song' which (almost) completely buries Davy's vocal, allowing it to come across as a solo Micky Dolenz performance.  'Porpoise Song' is one of my all time favorite tracks and I love the way Mick and Davy's voices work together, but this rough mix sends me because it's so novel and appreciably different from the familiar version.  Also a delight to hear are the four in-concert recordings (of which only 'Circle Sky' was used in the film).  The recordings here are a bit brittle, but mighty fine additions to the set (painfully long 8 minute introduction by a local DJ not withstanding).  I'd love to see these on film if that survives, but the audio is cool on its own.  As has been pointed out by others, the direct-from-the-film recording of 'Daddy's Song' and 'Can You Dig it' have relatively poor sound; the rips I made years ago onto my computer from the Rhino DVD sound cleaner.  The set is packaged the same way as the 'Birds And Bees' collection, in a nice 10 inch box with a reflective cover to show your own 'Head' as you look at it (haven't seen a copy like that since my old original LP).  The booklet is full of rare pix and stories about the making of the film and its impact on the participants, but it is seriously lacking in song details.  The 'Birds And Bees' booklet is full of such info, but of course doesn't have to fill in details of a movie in its pages.  Still I would have like more details about the 'Head' soundtrack songs.  The mastering is good (as with the other set some tracks are acetate needle-drops but are well cleaned).  There are some strange editing decisions, though - sound bites from what must have been some sort of ads about the film are jammed in between a couple of tracks which to my ears disrupt the flow, but i suppose I'd rather have them than not.  Also the original album tracks (1 to 14 on CD one) don't sound to my ears as well remastered as the 1994 version.  On a couple of tracks I can hear distortions that were not on the old CD version.  So would I recommend this set?  Yeah, with the caution that you really, REALLY need to be into The Monkees to appreciate it in any meaningful way, shortcomings and all.  BTW - the bonus 45 single, instrumental mixes of 'Porpoise Song' and 'As We Go Along' are excellent as it allows you to appreciate the musical complexity of each track. But given the space left over on the CDs, these should have just be included on the set.",3,"12 22, 2010",OK For What It Is,1292976000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},6.0,,local porpoise maybe performance onto ear treatment say dig disc fine delight jam favorite many thing flow sure make different song dvd davy's seem really point boxed original withstanding audio rip reflective couple bit meaningful almost across dolenz version would actual booklet hear mighty familiar track bad ago include listens info tv disrupt participant sound clean special set interestingly expect go give seven glow much acetate shortcoming bee recording like unreleased caution revolution soundtrack heel could come four might open btw appreciably alternate musical micky technology issue tape long hope mick see consider one in-concert love make relatively bonus material direct-from-the-film likely give strange appear worth daddy's effect time rarity cd also monkee mastering still see solo per year story floor complexity appreciate since decision doubt old though asap allows there's feature introduction bite worthwhile allow deluxe give rather film record nice pix vocal play yeah head work however recommend survives song need opportunity package others hot job war dj least circle rabid poor impact i'd voice slightly impression edit must suppose davy find box leave course face predecessor entire place rough mix bird highlight bask seriously good single use stun come game bang-up sky part interview monkees send novel handmade i'm distortion along look well say remastered follow brittle fall track fill directly tag must-have way california appear ordered space movie present completely inch addition already feel needle-drops addition bring include fact play rare miss computer painfully rhino together lp collection price copy minute want full cool sort page album mono skip instrumental fan miss even clean matter mix current short lacking cover excellent end detail buries show cds collection ad rip

523,614936,AQRALCBRAZEMT,B0009WFFS6,Stephen Renfree,True,"There was always a certain arrogance about Cream.  Even their name proudly trumpets the musical acumen of the three participants.  And in true form, the 2005 concerts are presented not as a reunion, but as the next album.  The problem is that a lot of water has gone under the bridge since 1968.  Some of it has carried Eric Clapton to new heights of super stardom.  But some of it has seen the truly gifted Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker disappear into old age and questionable relevance.  So what we have here, to be blunt, is a superstar who plays like he's desperately avoiding making a mistake, with two band mates whose moment of spotlight was extinguished nearly four decades earlier, but who play like they have nothing to prove.  Bruce, who had only recently suffered a liver transplant, spends a lot of the gig seated, but manages to muster an admirable energy from his pipes.  Baker seems content to fluidly shuffle his way through the material competently, but rarely gives us the flashes of rhythmic mayhem that were his trademark.  It's a mean thing to say, but for much of the gig the drummer could be any decent jazz drummer.  Cream live could be a mixed bag at the best of times.  Where they succeeded for me, were in those moments of pure improvised jazz - like the live Spoonful on Wheels Of Fire - which goes on an incredible journey with the seamless interplay.  It was risky, and sometimes it didn't work.  But that's how it is with risk-taking.  Having said all of that, it's great to see these troupers trot out their old set list.  They don't disgrace themselves by any means, - far from it - but they seem to be content to rest on their laurels a bit.

543,1131311,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000002IP7,Alfred Johnson,False,"Okay, I have spent a fair amount of time tracing the roots of rock and roll back to the early 1950s and the heyday of rhythm and blues. And of course part of that process required a look, a serious look, at the pivotal roles of the likes of black male R&B performers like Big Joe Turner, Ike Turner and Little Milton. Those are some of the key forces that drove the sound. Unlike the early blues, however, where black female singers dominated the charts and the flow of where the music was heading women were not as prominent in the link between R&B and the emergence of rock and rock as a national (and later international) musical genre. But they were there. And the black (and proud) female singer under review here, Ruth Brown, rightly known under the moniker ""Miss Rhythm"", was right there along with Dinah Washington and Lavern Baker to sing up a storm. Thanks, gals.  The name Ruth Brown has come up a number of times in this space when talking about 1950's blues, R&B and rock. However, those occasions have usually been as a ""talking head"" commentator in documentaries like Martin Scorsese's multi-part PBS blues series of 2003. And the tale Miss Brown had to tell about the background to her performing career  was not pretty concerning the segregated dance halls, second-rate accommodations and other intolerable conditions that black musicians, great and small, male and female had to work under. Despite that, she still had a few crossover hits and got those white teenagers jumping. That doesn't make up for the indignities she suffered, nothing will, but she has to know that in her prime she had that thing- ""Miss Rhythm, indeed!""  Some of this material on this 2CD set sounds as fresh today as when it was first recorded. Others, as is the nature of such compilations, are either gimmicky, second-rate or both. Here are some of the fresh sounds that highlight Miss Brown's talent; ""So Long"", ""Be Anything"", ""5-10-15 Hours"", ""Daddy Daddy"" and ""Mama He Treats Your Daughter Mean"" (Wow, on this last one).

544,1289362,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B00065LGP2,Irishgal,False,"Like many Americans, I had never heard of Westlife. It wasn't until I was living in Northern Ireland that I first learned of the band, and it was during the fall of 2004 that I first began to hear about former member Brian McFadden. His personal life was all over the papers, speculations and scandals, and I was quite surprised to find out that one of the songs that I enjoyed listening to on the radio, 'Real to Me', was, in fact, his. Despite all of the media attention surrounding the Dubliner, this is one artist who can write - and sing!  Released as McFadden's debut solo album, ""Irish Son"" is deeply personal, drawing on the artist's life. Most of the songs deal with fame, heartbreak, and trying to make sense of reality, and while some of the actual melodies are quite similar to each other (hence the 4-star rating), all of them are easy on the ears. 'Real to Me' is a song about the double life that celebrities tend to lead ('No one knows me but they know my name/That's not real to me'), while 'Lose Lose Situation' is a catchy tune about marital fights. Marriage is a theme that runs rampant through the album - or, rather, the dissolution of one. Hit 'Almost Here', a duet with Aussie Delta Goodrem, and 'Sorry Love Daddy' speak candidly about divorce, capturing the pain and suffering that occurs during such an event.  There is one song that, while joyful sounding, can be a bit offensive to some. Title track 'Irish Son' speaks about the frustrations that many of Ireland's natives feel with the Catholic Church. Lines like 'Go hit me now/That I'm twice your size/We brushed off the accusations/And bowed before your lies' are quite blunt, and while McFadden's lyrics may be reality for some, they are offensive to others.

547,197047,A8CYS17WU9V1K,B000002KHI,dfle3,False,"A while back I reviewed the double cd Black Sabbath ""Best of"" and gave it weak score...something like 2.5 stars out of 5 or something. The reason I gave it such a low score was that I only liked a few of the songs on it, and on a double cd compilation, that is poor strike rate. Anyway, the other week, I reviewed the band's debut album and found that a more rewarding experience than finding out about them via a compilation album. What made it easier to buy ""Paranoid"" was that it has ALL of the songs I liked from their compilation. Which made a high score on this review as close to a certainty as you can get...a few terrific songs, on one cd...excellent strike rate.    So, if you've never checked out Black Sabbath before, speaking from personal experience I'd now recommend buying their first two cds. The first gives you an 'album' feel for their music, whilst ""Paranoid"" is pretty much a ""Greatest Hits"" experience. Will check out two or three more of their albums in the future, probably chronologically as well.    Anyway, quite a few months back I nominated Australian synth pop act The Flowers' debut album, ""Icehouse"", as the greatest debut in pop/rock history (well, at least for the debut albums that I've heard!). In similar vein, I am now nominating ""Paranoid"" as the greatest second album in pop/rock history. Their debut album really does not make you feel that they will explode on the scene with highly commercial and mainstream music. ""Paranoid"" makes you feel as if they have the song writing chops to keep on keeping on (my experience of their ""Best of"" suggests that this belief was unfounded).    Of the early rock records that I have recently explored, ""Paranoid"" seems to be the birth of what is recognisably popular heavy metal. I'm more comfortable calling this album ""heavy metal"" than their debut album. Here's what makes this album an all time classic (not just of heavy metal):  War pigs: running at just under 8 minutest in length, this is a passionate denouncement of those political and military leaders who insist on taking us to war. Written over a handful of years after Bob Dylan's immortal ""Masters of war"" (from the album ""The times they are a changin'"", which I've reviewed here recently), it's not quite in the same class as Dylan's stripped back polemic, but it is a close cousin to it. This is the era of cold wars (between the US and USSR, as it was then known), and hot wars (the US in Vietnam) and people feared the possible destruction of humanit on the nuclear mushroom cloud. ""War pigs"" is a classic of era, along with ""Masters of war"" (1964)and Barry McGuire's  classic from the following year, ""Eve of destruction"" (1965). Featuring an air raid siren in the introduction, ""War pigs"" seems to be the first heavy metal protest song, with its distorted riffs (the guitars practically ring out in this song) and melodic lead guitar. As usual, Bill Ward's drumming is interesting (his style seems similar to his contemporary, Led Zeppelin's John Bonham, it seems to me).  Paranoid: has a driving rhythm, distorted riff and melodic lead guitar. ""Ozzy"" Osbourne's vocal delivery is interestingly done.  Planet Caravan: a lovely, wonderfully trippy song. Thought that maybe another band member took the lead on vocals here, but wikipedia states that Ozzy achieves his vocal effect on it with a ""Leslie speaker"".  A genteel song, with a New Agey vibe to it...has synthesiser, some piano, bass, and what sounds like bongos. A great song to have a hot bath to on a cold night!  Iron Man: my pick as the best song off the album. Has an ominous drum intro with groaning guitars. Then, one of the catchiest riffs in rock breaks out. Ward is not immune from walloping the drums on this track. In this song, the bass guitar is very lucid, which is what I like. Apart from the riff, there is some lead guitar work happening too.  Electric funeral: not sure if this song featured in ""Best of"", but I seem to have found the experience more rewarding on this album than that, if it was on that. Has a gloomy riff, which the bass shadows. The lyrics are, once again, towards the nursery rhyme end of the scale, but not in a bad way. The bass is interesting in this song but the backing singing is a bit cheesy...fortunately it doesn't go on for too long. Another Apocalyptic themed song...a product of the era from which it emerged. I suppose today's equivalents would not be so much concerned with the mushroom cloud, but with a environmental catastrophe (a nice example of that would the Midnight Oil's song ""River runs red"" from a good album of theirs called ""Blue Sky Mining"", which I've reviewed here).  Hand of doom: the last song on this album that I think is quite good (I've basically discussed the first five tracks in a row up until this one). Another epic song, runnng at just over 7 minutes in length. My favourite part of this song are the bookends to it...a slow, bassy groove. The middle part is more rock orientated and features a word picture of human decay. I could class this song as 'heavy metal'...more so than the songs from their debut album.  Other songs of interest(well, the album only has two more songs on it!):  Rat salad: Structured similarly too Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick"", this is an instrumental by the band, with a long drum solo in the middle. Led Zeppelin are argued by some critics to have invented heavy metal. Others attribute this to Black Sabbath. Led Zeppelin perhaps the catchier band jam on ""Moby Dick"", but if you like the spotlight on the drummer, you should like ""Rat salad"". In the mid 60's, Cream's debut album, ""Fresh cream"", also gave way for an instrumental, in ""Toad"". The drum solo on that is way longer than either Led Zeppelin's or Black Sabbaths...however, Led Zeppelin's John Bonham could make his drum solo stretch to over ten minutes, if he wanted to! My favourite drum solo instrumentals are ""Dance with the Devil"" by Cozy Powell, and Cozy Cole's ""Topsy turvy (part 1)"". Cozy Powell took his moniker from Cozy Cole.  Fairies wear boots: features a heavy boogie groove and good lead guitar at the start and the end. Has a chunky rhythm guitar too.  This album is getting 5/5 stars from me. The band is tight, and the bass is always there or there abouts. Rhythm guitar is chunky, the drums are interesting and the lead guitar does solo at times. Ozzy's vocals are glassy and always promising to break, without ever doing so. Not sure, but the sound mix in this album seems way better than on my ""Best of"" compilation...can't remember, but maybe I marked that compilation down for its sound quality. On this album, the sound is fresh, and you can isolate whatever instrument you care to listen to.  Have not had a chance to watch the ""Quadrophenic"" mix on dvd from this version, as I don't have the right equipment to do this justice. Did listen to the alternative version of ""Paranoid"" which comes with this version. It's the kind of version that you could either take it or leave it. I listened to it once, which is probably enough for me, but others may prefer to listen to it frequently. On that, ""War pigs"" is meant to be an instrumental, but you can very feintly here Ozzy's singing, occasionally, in the background. ""Paranoid"" has some incoherent lyrics on it, and the lyrics that you can make out, are not as good as the final product. ""Planet caravan"" also lacks the soothing vocal quality of the original...not sure, but maybe it is the original vocal, but just without the Leslie speaker working its magic on the song.

555,1199759,AGYCSZBTDBJRU,B00000GCAF,Rogerthat!,True,"This is a satirical review from one who listens quite a bit to Mahler's music, to this specific symphony, and believes his music is safe to hear.  Major Mahler listeners risk depression. I do not know anyone who could orchestrate and compose depressing music better. He was just brilliant at it. He could have been Mussorgsky's counselor, and that would take some doing. He appears to be a Jungian dream, a major psyche case. I can just see him sitting with Freud. His music is really taking off as our kids watch horror shows at the movies. With his scintillating Das Lied von der Erde, Mahler skates between life and death and ends up guess where. Tired and out of breath. That's enlightening. But it's fun and its brilliant, and one gets hooked.  Of course, I just love this music and tilt my zany side toward describing it like this. (I am really hooked on a lot of Mahler's amazingly creative music!)Some of his music, as I said, I really have really warmed up to. Some days when the bottom falls out and I feel really like a loser, it's always great to go home and put on some Mahler. And I find he could lament circumstances far more nobly than my pity party. Friends, that's what he does better than anyone else. Try him out and see. Don't try to understand it. Just feel it, and you'll get it.  Whether or not you agree with all that, I love the way Sir John plays this 5th. His conducting reminds me of a pole balancer walking a canyon. Tip this way or that way, and you're gone. Got to balance it. My, Sir John does a great job of balancing this controversial symphony. I don't know anybody who conducts this psyche case music any better. This symphony is brilliant, difficult, and amazing. And Sir John pulls it off. What a devoted performance!  As I indicated, I think the conducting is simply amazing. The committed orchestra plays flat out. And the triumph of this performance squeals out of the cd in probing, convincing doses. I have listened to a lot of performances of this symphony, and I own several different copies of it. However, Sir John's is the most convincing, and the most commendatory I have ever heard of this brilliant neurotic's music. It's too bad Gustav Mahler did not live in the era of Aeschylus.

568,1013420,A11GY1G10WSE8,B00K3Q0XGM,Rik22,True,"It is certainly refreshing to this reviewer as a longtime Chicago fan, that the band is back showing off the elements of their sound that made them one of the most successful bands of all time and a staple on 70's and 80's radio: Good, melodic songwriting; strong, diverse vocals and harmony blends; interesting arrangements and different musical styles; the powerful, warm and fat Chicago horns blowing free through each composition.  Oh wait on that last one.  While the horns are great on this album, the original line up of Pankow, Parazaider and Loughnane only play together on 3 of the 11 tracks!  In-concert subs Ray Hermann, and Larry Klimas appear on 8 sax tracks here, and trombonist Nick Lane appears on several that Jimmy Pankow sits out on.  While I realize that this album was recorded mostly on the road via a cutting edge mobile system, and there were related recording constraints, this is still disappointing.  The worst case here is the album's opening title track, ""Now"", which is a well-crafted jazzy pop gem with an infectious chorus and great vocals and a blazing horn arrangement.  I had heard this tune several times before receiving my copy of Chicago XXXVI and loved it.  Imagine my disappointment when I read the credits and found that no Chicago musicians appear on the track except for guitarist Keith Howland's solo.  The horns are penned by industry veteran trumpeter Harry Kim and played by his gang of studio ringers.  Oh well, at least the rest of the album is carried by fine musical performances by the Chicago band, aside from the horn issues as noted. Extra credit to Robert Lamm for showing off some really fine songwriting and vocals throughout, reminiscent of his excellent ""Subtlety and Passion""  a number of years back.

584,549833,A19L4J82QJPY7B,B0000DII8S,J. Gordon,True,"Make no mistake: Black Sabbath invented heavy metal as a genre.  Sure, one could technically say Iron Butterfly's ""Inna Gadda Davidda"" was the first metal song per se, but that song was essentially a novelty, a one-off by a band which was more akin to a harder-edged version of the Doors, which just happened to hit upon the right combination of baroque melodies, lurching note intervals, and thick distortion on this one song for it to be metal's first appearance.  While the mainstream media consistently and mistakenly refers to Led Zeppelin as metal, and some metal puritans claim metal wasn't invented until Judas Priest's ""Sad Wings of Destiny"" (or even as late as Iron Maiden's first album circa 1980), Black Sabbath were clearly the first band to consistently create what to this day can be called metal.  Sure, the first album's sound owes some of its lineage to Cream (compare the drumming in the verses of ""Black Sabbath"" to ""We're Going Wrong"", or the insistent riffing and elastic bass of ""N.I.B."" to ""Sunshine of Your Love""), but something.....HAPPENED when that first album was recorded that removed the music from the blue-rock/blues-based hard rock arena, and made it something that no one had heard before.  Of course, the music press critics hated it from the get-go, as Sabbath committed the cardinal sin of offending the blues/jazz/rock 'n roll purism that was essential to pop/rock critic orthodoxy, and made the mistake of having no desire to be subtle, but also having musical ambition.  Black Sabbath were the masters of non-subtlety: they actually made it work in their favor, and made their direct approach sound like a force of nature.  ""The Black Box"" is a collection of the first 8 albums Black Sabbath released, all of which had the classic Ozzy Osbourne/Tony Iommi/Geezer Butler/Bill Ward lineup.  My Sabbath collection, like many, consisted of myriad bargain-basement, bare-bones tapes and CD releases- the kind with no liner notes, that you might find sold at a truck stop.  The sound quality across these releases was atrocious, often birthed from 3rd generation copies of the master tapes.  ""The Black Box"" remedies this, as it was drawn from the original master tapes, and apparently supervised by the band itself.  I can't compare this accurately to either the Castle 90's remasters or Universal 2009 remasters that are often discussed in terms of which version is best.  What I can tell you is that overall, the sound quality is very good, and not nearly as compressed and ""harsh"" as some of the audiophile obsessives from the ""SH forums"" might lead you to believe.  There are some moments, most noticeably on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, where the mastering runs a tad too hot, but there's no real ""brickwalling"" going on here.  The instruments are clearly reproduced, and details emerge that were lost on the older CD issues, thanks to a much fuller, less muffled sound.  In addition, prior issues with channels cutting out on ""War Pigs"", ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"", or ""Hole in the Sky"" have been corrected.  In addition to the 8 albums, there is a 4 song DVD, and a velvet-covered hardcover booklet, which includes almost all the lyrics.  The CDs are contained in individual digipacks with cover art, in turn housed in 2 open-ended small boxes.  The albums:  Black Sabbath: The band's debut still remains stunning to this day, with the title track showcasing staples of metal: use of the tritone and half-step intervals, alternating sections of heaviness and lightness, fast, palm-muted note-playing, and variations in tempo.  Tracks like ""The Wizard"" and ""Behind the Wall of Sleep"" may have roots in blues and blues-rock, but the band always took it one step further, with staccato, precision-based playing, and chord progressions that defied blues cliches.  Oh, and the tambourine that kicks in on ""N.I.B."" and ""The Warning"" manages to evoke a bit of R&B nostalgia that I can't resist.  The sound quality tends towards bright, but isn't thin. This version is notable for including both ""Wicked World"" and ""Evil Woman"", as opposed to the old US and UK versions, which only included one of those songs on each respective version.  Overall, the music on this album clearly still has roots in the music of the 1960s, but whereas Led Zeppelin still constrained itself from departing too much from more ""traditional"" rock, Sabbath clearly wasn't concerned about confusing the listener.  Paranoid: If Black Sabbath was the first proper heavy metal album, Paranoid, released less than a half a year later, was where the band really started to define the rules of the genre.  Slow doomy riffing (""Hand of Doom"", ""Electric Funeral"", ""Iron Man"") shares space with one of the first speed-oriented metal classics, ""Paranoid"" (which predated Deep Purple's own metallish speed-fest ""Highway Star""), an almost jazzy instrumental number (""Rat Salad""), and a spaced out psychadelic number (""Planet Caravan"") contribute to what many consider their definitive work.  The bluesy jamming found on ""The Warning"" had been reigned in on this album, replaced with tight discipline and sizzling, buzzing guitar in tracks such as ""War Pigs"" and ""Fairies Wear Boots"".  In addition, the first album's ""occult atmosphere for its own sake"" approach was exchanged for a dose of social commentary, albeit through an apocalyptic lense.  While ""black masses"", ""the Hand of God"", and Satan are referenced, this is done in the service of making social commentary about war and greed.  This album essentially launched the careers of myriad heavy bands, from Alice in Chains to Iron Maiden, by establishing the sound of the metal genre.  The sound quality on this release has a much fuller-sounding mix than before (the bass is actually audible!), albeit with a few moments where the sound comes a bit close to clipping.  Master of Reality: The band releases another seminal treatise on the rules of heavy metal, with an even heavier, murkier sound than before.  Nobody was really doing what Sabbath was doing at that time- not Blue Cheer, not Dust, not Sir Lord Baltimore.  While everyone is familiar with the drugged out sludge of ""Sweet Leaf"", Master of Reality saw the band honing the speed of ""Paranoid"" into one of the earliest songs to use the ""metal gallop"", ""Children of the Grave"", and using distortion and down-picking during the verses of ""Into the Void"" to essentially pave the way for ""extreme metal"".  It was about this time that Tony Iommi started tuning his guitar down several steps in the studio.  This is also the album where the band very consciously back-tracked from any ""occultist/Satanist"" veneer they may have allowed, by writing expressly pro-Christian songs such as ""After Forever"" and the doom metal masterpiece ""Lord of This World"".  The band did take a cue from Led Zeppelin insofar as they deliberately sought to create more ""light and shade"", by placing atmospheric, quieter tracks like ""Solitude"" and the acoustic instrumental ""Orchid"" between the heavier numbers.  This release is a major improvement in terms of sound quality over prior versions; you can actually hear cymbals clearly now!  Volume 4: Having established themselves as a real staying power, Black Sabbath decided to invest more time making their next record, and bring more variety into their sound while still remaining the world's then-heaviest band.  Volume 4 saw the band expanding its sound: ""Changes"" was their most commercial sounding song to date, a ballad (later tragically defiled by Ozzy's daughter in an ill-conceived 2005 remake) that eschewed guitars and drums for a piano and mellotron (played by Iommi and Butler), while Laguna Sunrise was a beautiful acoustic instrumental with a lush orchestral accompaniment.  Conversely, ""Cornucopia"" and ""Under the Sun"" were grindingly heavy and fuzzed out.  The epic ""Wheels of Confusion"" and ""Snowblind"" both saw the band trying to achieve a greater level of grandeur and complexity, while ""Supernaut"" sought to bring a bit of positive vibe to a sound that was focused on darkness.  The band's ambition may have exceeded their ability to execute it to their satisfaction; the muddled production and somewhat sloppy playing reflected the band's overindulgence in the decadent side of 1970s hard rock.  That being said, this album is still an absolute classic.  In terms of sound, this remaster is hard to peg, as the noticeably clearer high-end definition comes at the price of a somewhat less robust lower-midrange/bass response.  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The connoisseur's Black Sabbath album, SBS doesn't really boast much in the way of songs well-known to the mainstream, but it may well contain some of the band's most well-arranged and performed music.  By 1973, an initial wave of other talented bands playing what could be safely called early metal were emerging, in the form of bands such as Queen, Budgie, UFO, Blue Oyster Cult, and Judas Priest, some of which were blending Sabbath's raw riffery with progressive and pop influences.  SBS showed the band rising to the occasion, with the band members utilizing their full instrumental repertoires (synths, piano, mellotrons, flutes), using an orchestra again, and even pulling in Rick Wakeman of Yes to help out.  The title track alternates between crushing heaviness and jazzy clean guitar during the verses, before impacting with a 10-ton downtuned section, and a fast-paced chaotic outro.  ""Sabbra Caddabra"", ""A National Acrobat"" and ""Killing Yourself To Live"" showcased varied segments within the songs, played with more confidence and precision than had been the case on the preceding album.  Meanwhile, ""Looking For Today"" ironically looked back to the late 60s, essentially marrying metal with the Moody Blues, with a rather prominent, recurring flute part layered over acoustic guitars and organ, contrasting with the heavy guitars dominating other parts of the song.  While the sound quality is improved over the deteriorated, intermittent sound of prior versions, it also occasionally strays into clipping.  Sabotage: If songs like the soaring, orchestrated ""Spiral Architect"" from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath indicated the band was heading into a more ""sunny"" direction, their next album, Sabotage, mostly refuted that impression.  The guitars were much heavier and crunchier than ever before, with the chaotic ""Hole in the Sky"" leading off the album with a grinding assault on the senses.  And if ""Symptom of the Universe"" balanced its proto-thrash first two-thirds with a light-spirited acoustic guitar `n maracas outro section, the rest of the album was almost oppressive in its darkness.  Despite the band's assertions of ""getting back to rock"", Sabbath continued to layer its sound with keyboards, choirs, synths and atmospherics, and made their songs more elaborately structured (half of the songs on the album were between 6 and 10 minutes in length).  Sprawling, nightmarish songs like ""Megalomania"" and ""The Writ"" were filled with a world-weary, visceral menace that bordered on desperation, a reflection of the band's increasing internal and external pressures.  Despite the band's problems, Sabotage's complex song structures would help lay the foundations for prog-metal, even if it took Rush's ""2112"" to really establish that subgenre.  Technical Ecstasy: Despite being slagged by fans as one the weakest Ozzy-era albums, Technical Ecstasy actually is mostly a very good piece of work, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first 6 albums.  ""Gypsy""is a superb piece of goth-metal that starts off sounding almost happy, but suddenly takes a surprisingly dark turn, while ""You Won't Change Me"" incorporates a rather morbid-sounding organ effectively.  While Bill Ward's ""It's Alright"" gets a lot of flack for its Beatle-esque pop approach, it's a much better song than what could possibly be Sabbath's first bona-fide stinker (not counting ""FX"" of course!), ""Rock `N Roll Doctor"", a clumsy attempt to sound like Slade.  This album was where it became clear that the magic of the first Sabbath lineup wouldn't last forever.  Still, it's hard to fault an album with a song like the epic closer ""Dirty Women"".  Never Say Die: By 1978, Sabbath's dominance in the metal genre was being successfully challenged.  Judas Priest had managed to take the heavy, gothic sound Sabbath had invented, and successfully graft Deep Purple's virtuosity and speed on top of it.  Halford and company had essentially forged the next iteration of the genre, and were steadily ascending (1978 would see the release of both ""Stained Class"" and ""Hell Bent For Leather"").  Meanwhile, Black Sabbath was imploding, with Ozzy quitting and then rejoining.  The resulting album, Never Say Die, was sort of a mess, and it seemed as if the band had no idea what direction to go in.  Ozzy sounds disengaged and out of tune on tracks such as the title cut and ""Johnny Blade"".  While there's some quality to be found in eclectic experiments such as ""Air Dance"" and ""Over to You"", much of the album sounds like a band without focus or enthusiasm (e.g. the woeful faux-jazz instrumental ""Breakout"").  The album isn't awful per se, but it underperforms by far compared to all its predecessors.  At the end of the day, the Black Box collection succeeds in documenting the true birth of heavy metal, in suitably improved fidelity.  While Led Zeppelin may have preceded (and even influenced to some small extent) Black Sabbath's mutation of blues-rock by a close margin, the mighty Zeppelin's body of work was too diffuse an entity to really lay claim to being heavy metal, which isn't an insult by any means to either group.  Sabbath may have been less sophisticated, eclectic, and broad-ranging in its appeal, but their more focused goal of blazing a new trail, beyond the more traditional forms of music Zeppelin adhered to, helped lay the foundation for a style of music that can easily co-exist with the broader, more accessible realm of hard rock that Zeppelin pioneered.",5,"11 5, 2013",The Birth of Heavy

Songs like ""The Space in Between Us"" and ""No One Else Knows"" are well-crafted, hook-laden pop/rock songs.  The latter is a beautiful ballad, which is currently making its way up Christian radio.  In the ""Spirit Lives On"" the band starts with a promising musical intro that unfortunately gets lost in the background.  Without wanting to take away anything from their break out hit ""Glory Defined,"" it's songs like it that employ crunchy guitars that sound a little generic.

The CD also includes the video for ""Glory Defined.""  The additional songs don't add that much.  Those who have the 12 song CD are better off waiting for the next release.

593,311263,A4LLXH0IZ3LMQ,B0000063BQ,Christopher Forbes,False,"Frank Martin's Mass is one of the undiscovered gems of the 20th century choral repertoire. Written when Martin was 32, this work is a deeply felt spiritual testament by an underated composer. The work has one foot in the Renaissance and one foot in the modern world. Much of the melodic material is modal in character. The harmonies are decidedly chromatic, but chromatic in a Faure/Durufle sort of way. And the rhythmic vitality of the Gloria is astounding. This is a difficult but rewarding work and deserving of much more attention. The remainder of the disc is filled with an organ piece by Martin in his more mature contemporary style and is rounded out by two piece by the Italian composer Pizzetti. Though the Pizzetti pieces are not as profoundly felt as the Martin Mass, they are quite beautiful and deserve a hearing. I have listened to this recording perhaps 30 times now, and if the trebles are terribly out of tune I don't hear it. Perhaps the recording engineer decided to forgo the autotune feature which has promoted the unrealistic expectation of scientifically precise intonation on many modern choral recordings. If so, I applaud him or her. This choir sounds beautiful and natural...not clinical. I agree with one of the other reviewers in saying that there is a lack of fundemental in the recording, but I'm not sure if highly chromatic works are always well served by so much bass partial.

In my opinion, this is just a sliver below Secret Treaties as their best work and I still go back and forth on which one is better. The first half, ""The Black"" side, to this day is some of the most wicked hard rock put on record with ""The Red and the Black"" roaring out of the gate. Definitely one of the most hard hitting tunes to start out any album, this is one of the band's finest and they still play this as a show opener. ""O.D'd on Life Itself"" is more mid-tempo and the most joyous track and the guitar work exemplifies that feel. That same guitar work also adds tremendously on ""Hot Rails to Hell"", which has a great chorus and is played with a ton of fire while ""7 Screaming Diz Busters"" adds a lot of drama and the performance of the rhythm section of brothers Joe and Albert Bouchard on this track is outstanding. The second half, ""The Red"" side, is much calmer comparatively and the songs are nearly as impressive with ""Baby Ice Dog"" pairing great organ lines with biting lyrics while ""Wings Wetted Down"" has an ominous guitar line to go with its cerebral feel. ""Teen Archer"" is the only song I wouldn't call great but it still rocks like hell while the original album closer ""Mistress of the Salmon Salt (Quicklime Girl)"" is the most melodic song and has another memorable chorus with the band harmonizing the ""Quicklime Girl"" line. The bonus tracks are very good and include the studio version of ""Buck's Boogie"" and a 14-minute live version of ""7 Screaming Diz Busters"".

599,108427,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00000273B,Andre S. Grindle,False,"Life is filled with many kinds of music. There's music to dance to. There's music to sing to.  There's music to scream to. There's music to think about. There's also music that communicates in some way with the senses of anything that's alive. Sometimes that's the sort of music that's the hardest to comprehend and makes some of us want to back off because it seems bigger than we are. There really isn't any need to go too deeply into the known talents of Joe Zawinul,Wayne Shorter and Miroslav Vitous.  After all if you in a band where two of it's members have musical associations with Miles Davis,your probably pretty set. From the beginning to the end of their career Weather Report never ceased to deliver original and rhythmically inventive music like few others could. But especially for so early in their career,this being their second album,it's still surprising how emotionaly...shocking this music actually is.    Strictly in terms of energy level,this album is just about the polar oposit of their debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weather-Report/dp/B0026RLM8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weather Report</a>.  That album cam directly from the 'In A Silent Way' period Miles,following a path light fingered musical touches and a breezy sound. Breezy and light don't fit anything on here. On ""Unknown Soldier"" alone Wayne's sax and Joe's unusually phased electric pianos (he didn't yet have a synthesizer) cry,scream and shout in and around this rhythmic tangle that can evoke an emotionally intimidated reaction. ""The Moors"",which produces a multi tracked harpsicord type effect is very much a Peter & The Wolf type melody that's both very beautiful yet very frightening. ""Crystal"" and ""Second Sunday In August"" continue the unusual melodic and rhythmic frenzy of the opener. After that there's three live numbers,a meldy of ""Vertical Invader/TH/Dr. Honoris Causa"",""Surucucu"" and ""Directions"". These three songs are have more of a flow and are jazzier. Not to mention the melodies being easier to penetrate.    Over time Weather Report definitely had their own type of sound. But it's important to note that the sound only occured after years of developed,trial and error. And this album is a perfect example. Obviously because Joe's unique synthesizer sounds and the bass of Jaco Pastorious were around the bend a little,this era of Weather Report tended to rely on it's source material a lot. And being made so early in the game for the fusion genre I suppose the only real source at that particular time would've been Miles Davis.  So his more abstract approch to electric jazz is all over most of this music. Than again Zawinul and Shorter were all over it too. Where this album did make a difference was the bigness of it's sound and the sometimes unsettling emotions it's melodic and rhythmic awkwardness produced for some people. It's kind of awe inspiring to hear. But off putting in a strange way. It's not common that musicians come together to produce sounds with such a frenzied emotional level. And since every musician tells a story,I can only guess what story Weather Report were trying to tell here.",5,"03 20, 2012","Whatever They're Singing,I Like What Their Playing",1332201600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,"joe story,i davis second member cease approch breezy produce abstract directly occur much unusually album&nbsp;<a genre sunday way wayne's touch sing emotionally like career honoris fusion awe level harpsicord vitous could songs frenzied know need come tended musician actually talent perfect rhythmic think emotion others guess important many evoke tell seem flow definitely unique musical phase invader/th/dr real bass path suppose obviously source surprising music hard reaction bend really debut strictly that's career,this miroslav joe's track term rhythmically lot back august shout tell original silent make sax unknown jazzier would've electric inventive tangle beautiful developed,trial try jaco live comprehend material emotionaly...shocking numbers,a easy sound kind unsettling strange synthesizer type crystal probably together scream fit moors"",which zawinul energy effect big meldy polar want light album,it's alone early melodic time sort cam bigness especially album produced common particular melody mile alive sometimes unusual deeply hear level,this produce also game vertical rely pastorious kind still short period data-hook=""product-link-linked band error report class=""a-link-normal year musicians deliver communicates pianos sens sound multi oposit report</a finger make causa"",""surucucu miles,following put never wolf frenzy begin continue penetrate around melody since set cry,scream two yet story opener peter davis,your intimidate life frighten weather mention emotional inspiring end make association there's direction people fill go jazz example zawinul,wayne three note little,this soldier difference anything every dance era awkwardness pretty"

Later in 2000 she signed with Capitol. The song ""Scream"" was leaked, the first single, long before the album came out. The song didn't catch on with radio unfortunately, it's a monster ballad that she sings with conviction and passion. The album was slated to have 11 songs, with two that did not make the cut. ""Why We Love"" and ""Sacrifice"", two great ballads that should have been on. Instead they worked on the album again and before it was released, she recorded two new songs, one which was the next single. ""Maybe, Maybe Not"" was a song written by fellow country singer Mila Mason (who also has her own version out now) which is a fun bubbly song that had a great video too. Once again failed to capture anyone's attention at CMT or country radio. A last ditch attempt was when they released the uptempo, tongue in cheek song ""Lips Like Yours"" which is a great song, but went nowhere. It's too bad the album didn't receive more attention, because it's some of the best music she's made. The other new song she recorded was ""Be With Me"", which should have been a single, a nice midtempo song about devotion. She covered Chely Wright's ""The Fire"", and gave it her own style. ""Tremble"" is the best ballad on the album, it should have been a single, it's just a great song that would have exploded at country radio. The ballad ""Lovin Your Man"" is a really great country song about being the other woman, the one the man cheats on his wife with. It's a great song. Other favorites include ""If I Feel Your Hand"".

601,370338,A1FFPPPIOSI36M,B00000JBEE,Scott B. Saul,False,"I love this album but let me honestly say that I'm not a big fan of Ted Nugent. When you have such a cartoonish, buffoonish persona, it's hard to seperate the goofy personality from the artist.  Setting that aside, this is an awesome hard rock album from the mid 70's era that is right up there with the other bluesy Deep Purple, Montrose, Aeromsith, etc. (Notice, legendary rock Gods Led Zeppelin are not included since you could not honestly put Nugent and Zep in the same sentence. I love this album but I'n not that enamored).  I remember buying this when I was in 12 years old...before Ted did the whole ""wang dang sweet poontang"" stuff. I believe this was his first album coming off the Amboy Dukes. This was a work representative of  a strong Midwest ethic, of which me being a ""Chicago boy"", I was in that fraternity. This was an album listened to by the serious music purveyor at a time when Nugent was considered a pretty obscure artist on the hard rock fringe. You had to [initially] stay up pretty late to catch a whiff of this on album rock, FM radio.  I pretty much bought this because a friend's cool older brother was listening to it. I obtained the album, glared at the slightly out of focus (couldn't really see his face), close up image of Nugent playing his trusty Gibson Birdland and then put on side one. ""Stranglehold"" starts it out and boy was I hooked!.  The song starts out with that classic simple riff, the vocals rip into those ""tough guy"" (well... it sounded like that at the time) lyrics and then the long spacey interlude takes place (you know, with the flanging effects that jump from speaker to speaker while Nugent shreds away on the guitar). Building up into a cresendo the song then comes back to the initial riff and lyrics. Obviously, as you are reading this you can tell I'm no journalist but this is 8:24 of a great song.  Although this is, most definitely, an in your face hard rock work, there are a wide variety of tunes and tempos.  ""Hey Baby"" has an electric, Chicago blues, familiar groove. All though there is some minimum lead playing, the objective for this one is more the melody and groove.  ""Just what the Doctor ordered"" has a decending, blues scale riff that carries the tune as vocalist Derek Saint-Holmes wails with his acrobatic yet very honest voice being the shining point.  My favorite song is ""Snakeskin Cowboys"" a testosterone-driven song that first casts a riff, with no accompaying instrumentation, and then gears towards a cliched (yet enjoyable) rock and roll progression.  Although there is a boatload of lead guitar playing here, there really is no self-indulgent noodling. Every note that is played counts!  The songs are great yet Ted Nugent is not the only active ingredient on this. Singer Derek Saint Holmes acts as a perfect foil to the guitar...tough singing being matched with tough guitar playing.  I started this review out by stressing that I do not worship this artist. After ""Free for All"" Ted Nugent became a ridiculous caricature of himself. But this album, with it's measley 10 songs, is one of the best, driving-with-top-down, guzzling beer, taking-a-deep- hit albums ever.

So when I saw this on Amazon, without any song titles listed, I assumed this was the 1980s album. Instead I found two discs with mostly popular music from the 1960s to 1980s, with only three of the titles of the previous album. This was NOT James Last's Seduction that was on my LP. It was a different album. The error that James Last made here was to give this album the same name as the older one. You can't do that. You will cause confusion.

My favorite songs include, Silver and Cold, Dancing through Sunday, Girls not Grey, and The Leaving Song/pt. 2. I don't get why there are so many negative reviews for this amazing album. There is nothing wrong with the way it sounds. Personally, I don't like the first few AFI albums (yes I HAVE listened to them and they make my teeth cringe). I don't like nor can I stand the sound of pure screaming when it comes to music. AFI's later albums, you can actually understand what Davey is singing as opposed to the early albums where you can't understand a single word he sings.  Silver and Cold is my absolute favorite song on the album. I feel I can relate in the sense I've been where the concept of the song is. I've had my low points where I felt unwanted like everything in my life is just a big failure and have had so many people in my life betray me to the point where I just wished I didn't want to live anymore.

I love the house mixes a lot and you get two incredible mixes here. The Thunderpuss Mix (7:42) just is really well done.  It moves from their aggessive style to then an almost Giorgio Moroder Type of music near the middle. Incredible. The Full Intention Club Mix(7:02) is more suited vocally to Whitney's Vocal on the song. Very Retro  in style and feel with heavy bass through out. Excellent. The P. Diddy Mix is why it gets 1 star off. It features a sample of KRS-One's ""Step Into A World(Rapture's Delight)"" which sampled Blondie's superior ""Rapture"" and this mix is sort of like Michael Jackson's ""They Don't Care About Us"" and that is not good at all.

It introduced a new beat for the Bee Gees, Barry's falsetto and moved them away from the ballads which had been their trademark.

622,1111581,A3KE0ZRXSDUIC0,B0000024QM,spaceneedleboy,True,"""More Johnny's Greatest Hits"" was released in 1959 and sold very well during the vinyl era.  Part of why I know this album so well is that ""More Johnny's Greatest Hits"", sometime  in 1960 or 1961,was a ""Selection of the Month"" for the Columbia Record Club.  My Dad was a club member and we ended up listening to this album a lot on his high-end component stereo system which included a Garrard Type A changer, Shure M99 cartridge, Harman/Kardon tube AM/FM stereo receiver and custom speakers in a custom console cabinet.  Johnny's singing is first-rate, the musical arrangements and scoring are exquisite, and the backup orchestra plays wonderfully.  Songs on the album include hauntingly beautiful renditions of ""A Certain Smile"", ""Stairway to the Sea"" and ""Small World"".  Other songs demonstrate Johnny's versatility, such as ""You Are Beautiful"" from the musical ""Flower Drum Song"".  The song ""Teacher, Teacher"" is notable for an amazingly jazzy orchestral backup.  This CD exactly follows the track sequence of the 1959 LP release, and there are no bonus tracks.  The album is just over 30 minutes which was common in the day.  The album features a bright, resonant sound because it was recorded in the famous Columbia Records 30th Street Studios, a converted church sanctuary with phenomenal acoustics for recording.  Hundreds of Columbia LP albums were recorded at 30th Street, and they bear that uniquely expansive and bold acoustic signature.  One curious note:  Although the title suggests that the tracks had already been released and had been major hits, these songs were all brand-new and had not been released prior to this album's appearance.  It's a mystery why Columbia titled this album ""Greatest Hits"".  Nonetheless, this is one of my very favorite pop-music albums of middle-of-the-road ""torch singing"" - it's the aural equivalent of familiar comfort food, and I cherish this CD release.  If you grew up listening to this album, consider buying this particular release since it includes each and every song from the original album and in the exact play sequence as the ""six-eye"" Stereo Fidelity LP or the ""Guaranteed High Fidelity"" monaural release.

624,802965,A35HCGU46XXV98,B00008G10M,Terrence Rusch,False,"Faith No More's most well known album, The Real Thing, is one of those records that just doesn't come off too well during the first listen.  Sounding like it was written for serious rock fans by a bunch of surfer dudes, it gives the impression of a serious lack of mentality (at first).  The melodies seem a bit askewed and thought up at the last minute, along with overly simplified lyrics and vocals that sound like overkill.  The  blugoening, take no prisioners speed metal riffs that are tied to delicate keyboards might sound like a contrived attempt at 70's style album rock. But that should just be your first impression.  By the second or third listen it will start to glue itself together as it draws you into its own distinctive hybrid of funk, thrash metal, punk rock, with a little r&b stuck in between.  You'll suddenly realize that these surfer dudes are really quite adept songwritters and are an extremely tight band.  They aren't feigning any prog rock tendancies, they're just interperuting them through a clever disguise of vapid, empty-headed, metal for simpletons.  But with its extended length compositions and hidden grandueristic motives, this album may provide more for arty rock types than metal-heads or fans of funky rock (a la red hot chili peppers). Enjoying this album just requires careful listing through the cretinous, moronic frat party rock- to find the true songcraft and insightfulness to the music.  But what does keep this album from being truely great is the somewhat less impressive second half.  After hearing the first five or six songs, the cover of Black Sabbath's War Pigs seems unneccesary and out of place.  The band just barely misses fleshing out the entire album with great music as it ends feeling incompleted.

626,481000,A38U3JIQWUON8P,B0000633JW,Frank Cohen,False,"""Flamotte"" (reviewer below)is clearly applying an ideological filter to the music on this very tasteful, comtemplative and, yes, coherent  updating of Shorter compositions. I mean ""updating"" in a good way, in that the group successfully resists the temptation to play these tunes  as they were played in the 1960s. A 21st century context infuses the delivery of this sublime music. If you are a Shorter fan and not a moldy fig like ""Flamotte,"" then you absolutely must have this in your collection. This group truly invites the listener to share in its contemporary explorations of classic Shorter compositions. I saw this group in Boston and it swept me away into an aural wonderland. As an anecdote in response to flamotte's complaint of lack-of-connection-with-the-audience, I invited my neighbor to come with me. He is more of a 70s-80s arena-rock music fan who did not recognize Wayne Shorter's name at all when I asked him to go with me.  He absolutely loved the show and could not stop talking about Brian Blade's sticks on the way home. Anyway, back to the recording. What I find startling is the incredible cohesion of the group without Shorter playing as if he is the leader. This group creates a unifying sense of space and time among the pieces without having to rely on Shorter's lead on stage. Shorter gets the best from all the parts by using his leadership to establish the group as a cooperative as opposed to a quartet under his lead. No one really comes across as a sideman in this recording and the recording is strengthened (not weakened at all) and made more coherent by this quality. In lesser hands, this approach could be a disaster. However, Pattituci, Blade and Perez more than live up to the challenge of being equal partners. They are not merely a rhythm section but co-creators. The group definitely takes a collective approach to improvisation and interpretaion and uses Shorter's pieces as a theme that serves to accentuate the compelling unity and coherence of this effort. The introspection of the group is, at a minimum, of equal intensity to Shorter's Blue Note efforts. The introspection may even be more intense since Shorter, unlike his Blue Note efforts, plays more like a partner (in the best possible sense) as opposed to a leader. By playing that role, he compels these very capable musical artists to immerse themselves in a contemplative mode that makes for a captivating listening experience. I wouldn't call this recording a classic like Shorter's Blue Note recordings because it is not as shockingly seminal but you must have this if you love those recordings as I do. This is a successful re-working of Shorter compositions. This is great jazz.

629,1214072,A2FPSBIEJ4NPZ7,B000025QUT,Hinch,True,"These 20 tracks, which are not in chronological order, were recorded for the MGM label from 1964 through the early 70s, before his 440 foot near death fall off a mountain in August of 1975. His voice sounds not a lot different than it does now, but the music is different. Some of the tracks, such as ""Make The World Go Away"" by Hank Cochran, are overproduced, with strings and background vocals, as many Nashville recordings were in those days. The background vocal group, on the Don Gibson song ""Sweet Dreams"", sometimes hides the sound of Hank's voice.  There's also plenty to like about this album. Six of the tracks are songs made famous by Johnny Cash, including four written by Johnny. They come from Hank Jr's album SINGING MY SONGS(JOHNNY CASH), released in 1970. On these songs, Hank is backed by some especially good players. The album starts out with a great version of ""Ring of Fire"", written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore, but my favorite of these is ""Understand Your Man"", with some hot licks from a steel guitar and someone doing some chicken pickin' on electric guitar. ""Folsom Prison Blues"" and ""Give My Love To Rose"", also have some of those good guitar licks as well. The other Cash songs include ""I Guess Things Happen That Way"" written by Jack Clement, and ""I Walk The Line"".  There are two songs from Hank's duets with Lois Johnson. The best of which is the Buck Owens song ""Together Again"". The other is ""So Sad"", written by Don Everly, which isn't a bad song either. There are three nice duets with Connie Francis. They are, The Everly Brothers hit, ""Bye, Bye Love"", ""Singing The Blues"" made famous by Marty Robbins, and the Hank Locklin hit, ""Please Help Me I'm Falling"", which is my least favorite of the three.  Another of my favorites is the Johnny Horton hit ""North To Alaska"". It has some strings and background vocals, but they don't overpower the song. The sound of a banjo adds a nice effect, and Hank puts in a strong vocal. He also does a good version of the George Jones song ""Window Up Above"". The last track on the cd is ""Your Cheatin' Heart"", the title song from Hank Jr's second album, the soundtrack of the 1964 movie, starring George Hamilton, based on the life of Hank Williams Sr.  My personal favorite, is the western ballad ""The Blizzard"", written by Harlan Howard. This track comes from Hank Jr's third album BALLADS OF HILLS AND PLAINS, released in 1965. I own a copy of the original vinyl album, which has been a favorite of mine for many years.

The opener, I Robot, is an outstanding instrumental, perhaps his second best (Lucifer destroys all competition).  I Wouldn't Want to be Like You is an excellent song, my second most played of all the Parsons songs I own.  If listened to through headphones, the beginning of I Wouldn't Want to be Like You is very cool.  The sound switches between earpieces, and the effect sounds amazing.  Breakdown has excellent potential, and would be a five star song up with the first two and next two if it weren't for the ""Freedom Freedom"" garbage.  At this point, the song just breaks down completely.  Some Other Time is a great song for the album and a great song on its own.  Don't Let it Show is another excellent song, one of my favorite Parsons songs.  The Voice is the track that best fits the concept, and is a good song on its own.  However, the clapping doesn't work.  I have heard the suggestion that the clapping represents a monotonous Orwellian society (think 1984), but I don't see it.  Nucleus is a good instrumental that sets the mood of the album, but is not particularly interesting on its own.  Day After Day is a very good song, followed by the eerie Total Eclipse.  Finally, Genesis Ch. 1 V. 32 closes the album with an instrumental that better than the previous two.  Listening to the album carefully reveals that each song, especially on the second half of the CD, flows into the next.  This is an excellent experience, full of great songs.

I was too young to catch Mazzy Star back when ""Fade Into You"" was in heavy rotation back in the nineties. In fact, I'd never heard the song until just a few years ago, but as soon as I did, I knew this band was something special. Only recently did I manage to pick up ""So Tonight..."" and listen to it. Geez, what an experience.  I really don't know why this band has been so marginalized for so many years. Their albums seem generally well-received but treated as dalliances rather than serious art, like, ""Oh, that sounds pretty. All right, onto something more serious, like Bob Dylan's new record..."" But Mazzy Star are more than just dainty-sounding fluff. One listen to this album was enough to prove to me, at least, that Hope Sandoval and David Roback are brilliant and talented people. A haunting voice, a skilled guitarist, deft songwriting, and lush production come together here to create something unforgettable.  Stand-outs include the aforementioned love-sick ""Fade Into You,"" the sparse and chilling ""Into Dust,"" the cryptic ""Blue Light,"" and the title track, a 7-minute psychedelic trip studded with squealing guitar distortion that still manages to sound lovely. I'm so glad that Mazzy Star have recently reunited and released a new album, ""Seasons of Your Day,"" this year. Otherwise, I might have forgotten about them like so many others.  I haven't yet fully listened to their other albums, but based on samples I heard on iTunes and the strength of ""So Tonight..."", I'm sure the rest of their work will be equally stellar.

But no sooner had he recognised the dilemma, than the solution offered itself. I'll just run over to the Philharmonie, he said to his wife, and make a record of Schubert's C major Symphony. She protested: ""But Herbert, you've always said you don't understand the music, that it's a mystery to you what he's on about!"" ""That's exactly right, Eliette,"" he replied, ""and that's why it's a good idea. I conduct and the orchestra play. They know how to do it!"" I don't remember where I read this story, and it's probably apocryphal. Maybe it's the kind of story that should be true, however, because it reflects a particular state of affairs relevant to this recording. In one of its many issues by DG, the sleeve note quotes Karajan as saying just the words that I put into Eliette's mouth. Karajan, on his own confession, never understood Schubert's 9th.

Laying there amidst autumnal leaves, a likened-hued packette awaits possession, House of Nightmares has found its way from one to another this fine Dractober evening, in the wake of Theater of Illusion. Contemplating this latest opus by the combined talents of Joseph Vargo & Jeff Hartz at Satan's Hollow, a breeze actually blew upwards from the black earth, like the breath of The Dragon upon the flesh.  The sun goes down...  This splendid combination yields another haunted opus for the Halloween season, and celebrations the year through. The storm arrives as the sun sets, creating  the mood on the way up the shadowed path, environments transgressed, sensations felt, then reveals the secret horrors which dwell within. What is it about this dark house that is so compelling? That certain glow, the strange shadows, the sounds...  Opening The Gates...  There is much one can relate to. In many ways, this release is a theme for that mysterious archetypal structure present upon the land and within the mind. Sound effects accentuate the permutations, the veritable dark force in nature orchestrated by daemonic hands. The Cover art features one such depiction*, the trapezoidal Black House, gray stone and iron spires, mansard roof, greeting with gargoyles and all those things that go 'bump' in the night, come and go, and live here...  Echoes From The Pit...  Vargo's classical compositions are thusly complimented by Jeff Hartz's occasional serrated contributions {perhaps best exemplified in 'Bridge Between Worlds'}. Of particular note, the title track 'House of Nightmares' {establishing the proper ambiance by rolling thunder, echoes from The Pit, and emerging fog, asserting the presence of the Hellementals}, 'The Summoning' {poetic incantation narrative to those we know so well}, The Black Abyss {churning, especially the sudden sounds of an impressive helltrain, no less}, 'Devil's Night' {featuring fiery tribal reverberations upon decorated skins}, and the absolutely magical 'Hallow's Eve', capturing the enchanting essence of the Belial season {spectral organ and harpsichord with the subtle strains of the 'Halloween' & 'Phantasm' themes}. These key selections are connected by a string of complementary orchestrations enhancing one another in kind.  Like those before it, House of Nightmares tells a musical story projected by the imagination, where the darkness itself serves as a canvas for dreams, for fears, & diabolical gratification, conjoined with the nefarious legends accompanying them, illustrating that dark side dimension within and throughout.  _____________ * It was also a delightful surprise to see a familiar face upon the CD, since Born of The Night.",5,"10 2, 2010",The tempest stirs...,1285977600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},2.0,,know shadow fear nightmares track glow vargo daemonic house even spectral hollow black go feature celebration much devil's serrate hartz's mysterious breath world create way capture like theme jeff skin selection serf enhance roof blow hartz arrives complementary earth way enchant accompany upwards come environment fine actually talent composition subtle connect thunder lay night title amidst emerge abyss likened-hued nature dark orchestration many theater treat within open accentuate permutation decorate secret tell effect force yield musical hand illustrate structure fog iron vargo's path surprise storm less find echo strain season exemplify thing dimension set contemplate dragon upon one combined face shadow tribal bump impressive possession transgress illusion string leaf live belial kind sound depiction strange splendid horror opus summon greet roll pit establish phantasm hellementals certain awaits mind perhaps mood theme spires especially imagination particular present dream diabolical familiar trapezoidal sensation felt sun key also dractober incantation cd trick late archetypal proper assert eve essence see gate organ stone art legends release gargoyle sound contribution occasional reverberation project fiery harpsichord flesh churn gray autumnal bridge side poetic delightful narrative bear compliment orchestrated classical presence darkness conjoin mansard since combination best story magical cover haunt satan's breeze throughout reveals relate hallow's nefarious wake gratification sudden packette go well year another compelling note canvas joseph dwell land thusly ambiance helltrain halloween absolutely veritable feature

I know it was the late 70's and all, so it's about what you'd expect, but that doesn't make it any heavier.  The guitar tone is a bit weak, and the drums just sound kinda flat most of the time.  Too bad they don't have a guitar sound like Sab had on 'Symptom of the Universe' or 'Sabotage' in general.  However, the production has it's benefits, and the whole album has a surprisingly sinister feel to it, particularly considering the era.  Simply put this is good stuff, and extremely metal for the time, and a definite extension of the Black Sabbath sound into more modern territory.  The whole band is extremely tight.  Tipton and Downing provided the basic template for metal lead guitar, and were thus so influential that they don't seem as striking and original as they likely were at the time.  Still, they're great soloists, particularly on 'Beyond the Realms of Death', which has some of the best lead work ever on a metal song, no question about it.  The rhythm section is very solid, though nowhere near as flashy would eventually become typical for a metal band.  Still, they more than get the job done, and the bass is very prominent, with some particularly nice work on 'Saints in Hell'.  Halford's vocals are just great.  He's one of the few singers who can shriek all the time w/o getting on my nerves, and he has got a very nice straight singing voice as well.  'Exciter' is a great opener, a definite standout, and a very nice piece of proto-speed metal.  Solid riffing, unrelenting drumming a catchy chorus and lots of great leadwork.  The infamous 'Better By You, Better Than Me' is a cover, and thus one of the more 'rock-ish' tracks on the  album, but it's a real standout anyway.  It's got a very solid groove, and some of Halford's best, most memorable vox, and is surprisingly atmospheric.  'Saints in Hell' is probably the most sinister sounding song on the album, with a fine, rolling rhythm section and a startlingly thrashy middle break, which is years ahead of it's time.  'Beyond the Realms of Death' is perhaps the prototypical 'true metal ballad' and is definitely the  best song on the album.  The basic framework is more than solid, with Halford's best vox on the album, and some fine, sorrowful acoustic guitars.  The chorus is sufficiently explosive, and the middle solo is simply astounding.  It's as moving and sorrowful as any solo you'll likely here, and the second solo later in the song is quite good too.  All the other tracks are at least pretty good, if not remarkable.  The title track is probably the best of the remaining tracks.  They've all got fairly catchy choruses, at the very least, even if the whole structure and tone of these other tracks isn't as satisfying as on some of the particular standouts.

Mullen's, 25 year old Anjulie's music is as rich as her heritage. Of Indian, Canadian and Guyanese descent, her music runs the musical gamut from the Jazzy Latin-tinged ""Columbia"", the acoustic/Ska-tinged ""Same damn thing"" to the bouncy contemporary R&B sound of ""Addicted2me"".  Opening is the single, the retro Nancy Sinatra-style ""Boom"" with creepy Morricone-sounding guitars and intermittent bursts of Brass. ""Rain"" is a stunning lilting summery ballad (""He got a knife in my back, stop turning please""), while raising the tempo a wee bit is the horn-peppered retro Soul ""Some dumb girl"" (with a groovy bassline, in which she commands her lover to ""Keep your clothes off, I'm not rushing out like some dumb girl).  A sweeping overture (""Crazy that way intro"") leads to the stripped piano ballad ""Crazy that way"" (with dramatic strings and multi-layered vocals coming in). Other standouts are the Ragga/Hip Hop-tinged ""The heat"", the corny yet sweet ballad ""Love songs"", the litling Soulful ""Day will soon come"" (like something Ms Bailey Rae would sing, with lyrics declaring her impending stardom) and closing Bollywood-tinged ""Jamba"" (think M.I.A and you get the picture).

Moving from innocent hope, love, wonder, to frustration, sadness, fear and then defiant triumph back to despair and calm acceptance, it forces the listener through the dark canyons and crevices as well as taking flight over the peaks and wide open spaces of the psyche.

They continue to buoy me up, take up the slack, and watch my back while cheering and bootin' me in the butt. Picturing that is hard to do, but they do it and it's priceless. Thank you dear Susan and Ryan. ~ Al Jarreau ~  This is one of the greatest and best-ever jazz albums of all-time and it's to-die-for every time I listen to it especially tracks two, four and five. Al Jarreau has been one of the exceptional jazz artists in my list of favorites. My stunning sister who's in her forties (but looks half her age) with a model-like figure who was once a piano teacher and has an exquisite taste not only in music, but everything else, introduced me to Al Jarreau's music in the eighties through one of his earliest recordings, ""Breakin' Away"" and from that point on, I was hooked with Mr. Jarreau's kind of music and his extraordinary vocal artistry. My top favorites from among his many hits are ""Wait For The Magic,"" ""Try A Little Tenderness,"" ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" ""After All,"" ""Mornin',"" ""Since I Fell For You,"" ""My Favorite Things"" and ""Teach Me Tonight.""  I can't wait to be at his concert with another great jazz artist, George Benson, at the Hollywood Bowl this August.  The charmer on this CD is Victor Young and Ned Washington's ""My Foolish Heart."" I have always loved this song and his interpretation is so sublime, his vocals soft and mellow and its Bossa Nova arrangement is so pleasing to my ears! Listen to it and you'll definitely agree with me that it's the best track of all. It starts off with a beautiful piano intro by Larry Williams who is also the arranger on this gem of a song and most of the tracks as well. It also features Anthony Wilson on guitar, David Carpenter on bass, Peter Erkstine on drums and Luis Conte on percussion.  The rest of my top favorites are Johnny Mercer, Sonny Burke and Lionel Hampton's ""Midnight Sun,"" which highlights the hauntingly beautiful harmonica playing of Tollak Ollestad, Hoagy Carmichael and Ned Washington's ""The Nearness of You,"" Duke Ellington/Don George/Johnny Hodges/Harry James' ""I'm Beginning To See The Light,"" Dizzy Gillespie and Al Jarreau's ""Groovin' High"" and last but not least, the song that I dedicate to my sister, Bill Evans and Gene Lees ""Waltz For Debby."" Thanks so kindly my beautiful sister! You really got an ear for good music.  Listen to this CD and enjoy the magic of Al Jarreau's extraordinary vocal artistry and the exceptional musicianship of his band: Larry Williams (keyboards/arranger), Christian McBride & David Carpenter (bass), Anthony Wilson (guitar), Mark Simmons & Peter Erkstine (drums), Luis Conte (percussion), Keith Anderson (sax), Russel Ferrante (piano), Tollak Ollestad (harmonica) and Larry Goldings (organ).

No women made it big in surf music, but the Honeys certainly deserved to. Some people think the Honeys only got as far as they did because one of them was married to Brian Wilson, but that's not how it happened. Brian was introduced to them when they were an unknown group. The relationship between Brian and Marilyn blossomed as a result of them working together. The Honeys had great voices and harmonies, ideally suited to the surf music they recorded. They didn't cover any Beach Boys songs (or indeed anybody else's songs, unless you count their adaptation of Swanee river, titled Surfin' down Swanee river) but relied on their own material, and other songs written by others, including some by Brian. This collection includes five tracks in which the Honeys provide backing for others, something they did a lot. One of these is Guess I'm dumb, in which Glen Campbell is the lead singer. Although he had been a studio musician with Phil Spector, he hadn't yet made it as a singer. This track has appeared on Glen Campbell compilations, but not often.

677,1229283,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B00004XSSS,W.T.Hoffman,True,"If Jimi Hendrix played Jazz fusion, this album is what you would have heard from him.  BAREFOOT BOY was recorded in 1971, and it rocks.  Throughout the album Coryell's guitar screams, sings, and explodes in a shower of shimmering audio fireworks. Leads are shared with Steve Marcus on sax, who stayed with Coryell on into the Eleventh House band.  Together they float over a soundscape of thick percussion, congas and drums.  Mervin Bronson locks down the bass, with a driving groove, that doesn't wander far from the home plate. The piano work for HIGHER CONSCOUSNESS is provided by Mike Mandel, who also joined the ELEVENTH HOUSE band. (This album is an ELEVENTH HOUSE album in all but name.)  The album opens with Szabo's GYPSY QUEEN, recorded not long after SANTANA recorded the same song on ABRAXAS. Marcus' sax takes the head, all hypnotic repetitions over a thick bed of Latin percussion.  Coryell plays his ax with fire and air coursing thru his fingers, at times erupting into psychedelic abandon very reminiscent of Hendrix on his BEST nights.  After that modal workout, you land into THE GREAT ESCAPE, which is again a riff oriented, boogie song. Coryell holds back a bit more, or rather remains a bit more melodic, hammering on the three chords which form the backbone of the jam tune. Which brings us to the epic CALL TO THE HIGHER CONSCOUSNESS.  Whoa, boy! The yearning, almost bluesy vibe you get from the circular four chords, would be boring in the hands of lesser musicians. However, the sax, guitar and piano weave in and out of each other, as the song opens up Coryell's inner universe, to merge with the higher conscousness of their group mind. With the heavy percussion, the excellent piano reiterating the harmonic colors, and the driving bass part, Coryell creates for himself a 20 minute canvas, to stretch out his melodic lines, and to exchange ideas with the sax and piano. The only flaw on HIGHER CONSCOUSNESS was Coryell's decision to allow the drummer Roy Haynes to take an extended solo.  Not that he plays poorly--I just cant stand drum solos.  Overall, I wouldn't say this album was quite as psychedelic as LADY CORYELL, where the guitar lines were often overdubbed up to six layers deep.  However, due to the extended, improvisational, LIVE feel of most of this album, it does sound like it could have been recorded at the Filmore.  I rarely buy any jazz or rock album, and listen to it front to back. However, not only did I listen to this album FRONT TO BACK the first time I played it, I played it straight thru the second night. The album is fascinating. Unlike the more experimental, atonal vibes you get with some early fusion (EMERGENCY, WEATHER REPORT), or the eastern raga rock influences of other fusion bands (MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA, EMBRYO), Larry Coryell balances his influences of Jimi Hendrix, and Santana, with more traditional jazz guitarists such as Gabor Szabo, or Jim Hall.  He sounds as far out as 1972 Jerry Garcia, without the noodling, or lost trains of thought. He's as fluid as Jeff Beck, without the breakneck speed for speed's sake. He's as intense as jazz-period Zappa, but without the Dadaist, avant guarde guitar lines. If you think this sort of music sounds appealing, I URGE you to get this album, before it goes back out of print. For what its worth, ALL MUSIC GUIDE awarded this title five stars, and also recommended it as a first pick for CORYELL newbies. However, the BEST OF CORYELL CDs that are floating around by Vanguard records don't include any of these songs.

I regret the omission of another wonderful song, Pictures Of You, but I suppose it wasn't ever released as a single. This might be considered heresy, but I enjoy their Mixed Up album of extended remixes even more with its spacious and elegant versions of these songs, plus Pictures Of You.  In fact, when I compare those magnificent long versions of Inbetween Days and Close To Me to these originals, they sound almost flat and one-dimensional.

The point  being, of course, that I'm just too damned relaxed to really enjoy this  record. Opiate is not a particularly bad extended player. Certain things  can be said in its favour, viz.: i. The rhythm section churns out a  particularly violent, plangent undertow upon which Adam Jones wreaks his  edgy guitar havoc and the aforementioned Keenan wails and yowls in his  heavy-duty tones. ii. The songs that were recorded live, namely Cold  And Ugly And Jerk-Off, apart from being downright scary in their thunderous  venting of spleen, resonate with uncommon clarity and cohesion. iii.  The record is free from the overproduced bombast of Aenima and the  too-lengthy psych-outs on Undertow. These things said, however, for me  this record is, well, too angry.

685,825584,A3RQZ1J5F5G104,B002JIBC80,jomojomo,False,"the Metropolis Symphony captures perfectly the mood and feeling of classic superman comics.  Big bold themes painted in vivid primary colors suck you and leave you wanting more.  Sometimes classical music takes itself so seriously, it is a nice change to have a work that doesn't.  The score is very evocative, kind of like good soundtrack music.  But whereas soundtrack music is hamstrung by the fact that it is totally subordinate to the visuals it is trying to enhance, this work gets to play through without any of that.  Just for fun, I pulled out my copy of John Williams 1978 score to the rather dated Christopher Reeve Superman movie.  I think Daugherty's work does a better job at, as the composer wrote, ""expressing the energies, ambiguities, paradoxes, and wit"" of the pop icon that is Superman.  There is no super sticky melody, like Williams' classic Superman phrase.  But the Superman soundtrack suffers from an inability to create, explore, and play with themes and ideas because its main purpose is to help tell the story of the movie.  So one feels the heavy hand of forced emotional manipulation and artificiality; all in all I was unsatisfied at the end of that disc.  Don't get me wrong, as far as soundtracks go, Superman is in the top tier, and it's not a fair fight pitting a symphony against a soundtrack.  Deus ex Machina has it's own vibe, quite different from Metropolis.  Its inspiration was trains.  In the very early part of last century, trains were the most vital and important agents of change and modernization.  They symbolized the future.  The first movement makes use of this potent symbolism and transmutes it through the lens of the composer's manifesto: abstract musical lines, mechanical velocities, contrary vectors, polyrhythmic vibrations, and fragmented reverberations.  The second movement uses the 'Train of Tears' as its inspiration.  The Train of Tears was the train that carried the body of Lincoln to various parts of the country so people could mourn and pay their respects.  It is a slow moving dirge incorporating Taps.  The final movement uses the end of the steam locomotive era as its inspiration.  By the 1950's, most trains were diesel or electric.  There were a few of the old steam engines still in service and photographer O. Winston chronicled the last days of the steam era.  Using these images as a guide, Daugherty attempts to create the feeling of these beasts of burden as they hurtle to their end.  The Deus half of the album isn't as successful as the Metropolis part.  I wasn't as engaged and it may have more to do with my mood that day then the music itself, nonetheless I'm deducting 1 star (not that it matters, LOL).  Oh and the sound quality is excellent.

Admittedly, the Scherzo threatens to bog down at Klemperer's brooding pace -- an anomaly in this performance. The rendition is a paradox: on the fast side (just under 80 minutes) but never losing the impression of monumentality and cragginess. The Bavarian Radio Symphony gives Klemperer its dark-hued best, and he enjoys the luxuries of violins (properly) split left and right, doing justice to Mahler's counterpoint, and the pipe organ of Munich's Herkulessaal at the grand climax. Janet Baker sings an expressive ""Urlicht,"" as you might expect, although she is arguably better with Bernstein and the London Symphony (Sony), but she is teamed ideally with limpid Heather Harper in the finale.

695,733236,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B0013LL0E0,Hype Currie,False,"New Jack Swing: Gold  New Jack Swing is one of the latest in Universal Music Group's `Gold' series of dual-disc themed anthologies.  New jack swing, as it was dubbed circa 1987, was essentially contemporary soul music, largely from performers then in their teens and twenties.  These were artists eager to put their stamp on soul but who didn't consider hip-hop an `enemy' genre (unlike many funk outfits of the 70s who absolutely loathed the disco trend).  Guy, Bobby Brown and others were also contemporaries of hip-hop's prominent artists; both genres influenced each other to effects seen here.  The creative aesthetic was heavily dependent on synthesized instrumentation and electronic drumbeats (inadvertently pushing session musicians out of the creative loop and making vocalist-centric acts preferred).  1980s club-music developments of house & techno informed new jack as well.  New jack swing's up-tempo tracks were sometimes interchangeable with the hip-hop/rap of the moment (sampling could be found in both), thanks in no small part to the most prolific single figure in the genre, producer/performer Teddy Riley.  Pulling recordings largely from Universal's vast library of historical labels and imprints (MCA, Uptown, Geffen, Motown), New Jack Swing: Gold covers recordings from the late 1980s up until the early 1990s.  The scene birthed new artists like Keith Sweat, Boyz II Men and Jodeci.  Members of iconic 80s boy band New Edition (Brown, Ralph Tresvant, Bell Biv Devoe) found greater solo success by adapting to the genre.  Rappers like Heavy D made lasting inroads with urban radio.  Even veteran soul man Al Green made a comeback of sorts with ""As Long as We're Together"".  Highlights on disc one include Sweat's ""I Want Her"", Debarge's ""A Real Love"", and Johnny Gill's ""Rub You the Right Way"".  Highlights on disc two include Wreckx N Effect's ""Rump Shaker"", En Vogue's ""Hold On"", and Tony Toni Tone's ""Feels Good"".  As for any downsides, there are a few:  Like most singles-driven genres, there ended up being a handful of one-or-two-hit wonders (Johnny Kemp, Tony Terry).  Next, while the singles here are mostly alternate, 12-inch mixes never released on CD, even on a two-disc set this means that some artists have been left out (Al B. Sure! only shows up to sing the chorus on Heavy D's ""Somebody for Me""; Mary J. Blige is completely missing; the new jack remix of Rod Stewart's ""Crazy About Her"" would have been a cute nod).  Also, no genre ballads are to be found here- New Edition's ""Can You Stand the Rain"" comes to mind--it's strictly a dance party on this set (perhaps a separate volume will be compiled for new jack slow jams).  Lastly, any kind of new jack swing collection tends to resemble a Teddy Riley compilation by default.  That Riley's hand is on nearly a third of the songs here can seem like overcompensation, but it shows how ubiquitous his influence was in black pop music of the time.  Contemporary hip-hop and soul began blending more frequently (rappers using soul singers on their hooks; soul singers bringing in rappers for a guest verse at the bridge of their songs).  New jack as a distinct youth movement in contemporary soul faded away, but the influence continues.",4,"01 4, 2013",Gen-X Gems Shine on on Nostalgic R&B Anthology,1357257600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,performer rub sweat jack resemble wonder club-music effect's influence imprint slow cover disc electronic figure d's vocalist-centric eager inform biv many tony sure riley making fade we're anthology singer verse bell enemy universal's interchangeable inroad part success guest right youth kind bobby end continue influence ralph mary would track late band include rapper nod keith release volume show instrumentation stewart's set two devoe boy synthesize push one-or-two-hit dance hook small guy drumbeats away house soul black radio sample act recording default like hip-hop/rap could handful hold cute effect disco alternate brown long wreckx teen see one love new make two-disc hip-hop johnny vogue's stamp tresvant time dub cd also ubiquitous theme universal solo riley's compile en downside scene loathe moment swing's up-tempo heavy label use library gold mind--it's contemporary crazy edition hand genre sing blige toni song mca others shaker terry next prominent remix al largely third mean veteran genre find debarge's music leave nearly frequently movement tone's series prefer pull mix highlight separate good consider single come early outfit perhaps swing mostly boyz sometimes begin motown hip-hop's artist distinct heavily man kemp great bridge geffen session dual-disc well loop birth compilation stand funk member inadvertently jam pop comeback aesthetic way teddy gill's edition's men uptown thanks completely trend sweat's vast overcompensation tend producer/performer creative prolific somebody feels single group's real rump development unlike urban put lastly rain strictly twenty dependent miss green historical bringing ballad ii contemporary together collection adapt want techno circa sort last singles-driven even rod iconic jodeci musician never chorus blend seem party essentially late absolutely

I'm so sick of these single releases with 20 minutes of music on them and just a couple of 'radio' edits of CLUB mixes.  while most of GaGa's songs still sound best in their original form since they are already slamming dance trax, Alejandro is a slower groove, and therefore, a couple of pumping mixes are welcome. It's really no surprise that two of the strongest mixes on here are the Dave Aude and Bimbo Jones mixes. These two remixers have turned pretty much everything they've touched in the past decade into gold. Many of the other remixes offer a variety of styles, including a lot of slow jams and some club friendly mixes that are more like dubs than vocal remixes.  So the ONLY thing I think is wrong with this release? The version I want MOST of all of this song is the EXTENDED mix of the original track as used in the Alejandro video. That version is like a classic old school extended 12"" version where they don't remix the song to sound totally different, they simply enhance the track by bringing out various moments of the song in more isolated, 'solo' moments.

My sisters were making fun of me and decided to tell me what kind of music I would/would not like, so I listened to this out of spite. Did I like it? Yes Will I listen again? Yes Her songs have poppy beats but I wouldn't quite call her pop. She's one of those that are kind of hard to categorize. Its an electronic sound that Im a little wary of, but only because Im not used to it. I like this album (and her) because she takes herself and her music seriously. So, even songs that are on the surface, pretty stupid, (Swine) have some magic in them and offer something to like. Gaga has taught me that fun in music doesn't have to be stupid. A lot of pop just does that on its own, and assumes it has to be. The only songs to break that trend recently are:  Bruno Mars- Treasure Ariana Grande- Popular Song  It can be done with a little effort, but who wants to try?

This is big news because the band seemingly could no little wrong for their first three efforts. It's not that this album is bad, it's not, it's very good. The band set the bar awful high, however. ""The world around me"" is one of the best songs ever written, pounding rythm with incredible guitar phrasing all layered with signature King's X vocal harmonies, big, fat discordant harmonies. The song is amazing to hear. ""Prisoner"" is a dynamic song with busy music underneath a slow moving vocal melody heavily layered with more harmony. ""Lost in Germany"" has a meandering guitar riff that takes a while to soak in before it starts making sense to the brain, and speaks of what seems to happen from non-stop touring through Europe. ""Black Flag"" was tapped to be the first single from the effort and a poor choice by the record company. A more straight forward rocker, it must have clicked with the record company as a possible hit as this was what King's X really needed to move to the next level. ""the world around me"" should have been the first choice as it was the truley smokin' song here. Other songs hit their mark, sort of, and others miss their mark, an unusual occurance as the band really made three solid albums with no filler to date.

You've heard one song, you've heard...well at least two-thirds of them.  The good news is that there's no chance that they'll be completely crippled by a grossly uncharacteristic hit like Butterfly or Who Let The Dogs Out.  The bad news is that the Nickelback comparisons start to creep in.  * The big hits are pretty much the big hits.  There are thre of them here (Semi-Charmed Life, Jumper, How's It Going to Be), more than the one or two that most albums have.  Unfortunately, nothing else really jumps out and grabs you.  * What's really holding this band back is the singing.  I know that I've harped on singers in the past, but the fact is that a voice that isn't crisp or doesn't have a lot of range really limits what the band can do artistically.  * On the positive side, these are good performances.  You can see some creative effort here (that you'd never see from Nickelback), and there's a nice mix of hard and soft, fast and slow, even if it all sounds roughly the same.  * And of course, the relatively daring subject matter, including suicide (always a touchy subject).  Put it all together, and unfortunately, I just cannot *quite* give this a thumbs-up (although 3 stars is hardly a thumbs down...yo, Amazon, the MIDDLE is not negative!).

741,531521,AAHXKHWO53M9E,B000091NKT,CaptainJack,False,"In 1987, the small LA club band Guns N' Roses, released their debut, titled Appetite For Destruction. Rock N' Roll wasn't at its best in that time; poppy-comercial crap ruled all around the world. Until the day AFD was released. To put it simply, Axl and company kicked a** of all those who said rock is dead - and proved it is not. This is what changed the world in the late 80s.  So what's so great about this music and that band? Isn't it just another rock n' roll stuff we had through the years? Well, the fact is - that Guns N' Roses were the last true Rock N' Roll band - You may argue, but this is unfortunately true. Rock N' Roll best years, the 70s were gone, the 90s were full of cheap commercial pop and alternative bands, and nowadays... let's not even talk about it. It was Guns N' Roses who played true, inspiring, Rock N' Roll at their time. There wasn't anyone like Them when They disappeared.  Back to the record - It is piece of raw, trash, wild, rough, raunch hard rock - and You can't help but love it. The opening riffs of Welcome To The Jungle set You right in there; It's So Easy make You even hotter - Slash kicks off with his dire guitar licks on Nighttrain; etc, etc... The others are great, too - like the major GN'R hit Sweet Child O' Mine with awesome riff at the beginning - just a really sweet, power ballad tune that always make You dreamy - and tear Your soul apart on Slash incredible solo. Anything Goes is another favourite - really cool one, very catchy - this song has got sexual innuendo and bluesy rawness that will surely please You. And the closing Rocket Queen, a masterpiece - Strong beat starts, and Duff comes in with bass riff... this song GOT THE POWER. Some stellar jammin' in the middle and the closing part, it's just excellent. Flawless.  Not to mention the others - Paradise City, another big hit, or dark rock-riffer My Michelle - This album is a joy from start to finish.

Fagen's envelope-filter-ish synth parts on ""green book"" and ""lunch w/Gina"" are perhaps the most inventive parts of the whole disc.  Also good is Weiskopf's Coltrane-inspired tenor horn on the title cut.  Becker's guitar does keep getting and better, making that slightly distorted Stratocaster sound better than Clapton ever did and with far more precision and expression.   Lyrics aside, the listener cries out for some melodic or rhythmic innovation SOMEWHERE on this disc.  Becker and Fagen are one of the best songwriting teams in all of music, but somehow Dan has become so generic.

It's a matter of detail, sometimes when you start losing detail, whether it's in music or in life, something as small as not sending a thank-you note, of failing to be polite to someone, you start to lose substance."" ~ Benny Goodman (1909-1986) ~  The above quote was part of Benny Goodman's responses to Glenn Miller's questions to him before he had his own band: ""How do you do it? How do you get started?"" His initial advice was ""I don't know but whatever you do, don't stop. Just keep on going. Because one way or the other, if you want to find reasons why you shouldn't keep on, you'll find them. The obstacles are all there; there are a million of them. But if you want to do something, you do it anyway, and handle the obstacles as they come. Even to this day, I don't like people walking on stage not looking good. You have to look good. If you feel special about yourself then you're going to play special."" That was a totally brilliant advice from a talented jazz artist to another one-in-the-making back then. Definitely Glenn Miller paid attention to his advice and became one of the most successful recording artists in his time.  A very fine clarinetist, a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Awardee and the King of Swing, Benny Goodman was one the greatest jazz artists along with Glenn Miller in the Big Band Era.  This CD features a collection of fifteen Benny Goodman's greatest hits recorded between 1935 and 1937. My personal choices from this compilation include Irving Berlin's ""Always,"" Kurtz/Mills/Ellington's ""In A Sentimental Mood"" and Gordon Jenkins' ""Goodbye."" These tunes were recorded by Benny Goodman and his Orchestra.  ""Body and Soul"" and ""After You've Gone"" are two tracks from The Benny Goodman Trio (Benny Goodman on clarinet, Teddy Wilson on piano and Gene Krupa on drums). It was Gene Krupa who bestowed upon him the title of undisputed ""King of Swing.""  Two of the best tracks are ""Tea For Two"" and ""Moonglow,"" which were recorded by The Benny Goodman Quartet (the Trio plus Lionel Hampton on vibes).

Their music also is inventive, given the limitations of loud punk and hardcore.  The reason why you can actually listen to them and Bad Religion and bands like them is that they produce variety in their music, even with just one guitar, one bass, one voice and one set of drums.

Demographics tells Sony/Epic that people between the ages of 13 and 21 buy more CD's than any other age market, and that they are more prone to anger and alienation than previously.

A pop-prog song that is just great to listen to. It's got a strange clash of emotions; there's an overall dramatic, dark tone to the song, but there's a fairly lighthearted drum machine beat going on in the background. Strange.  Land of Confusion - 10/10 - Great riff, just an overall great pop-rock song. It's catchy and everything you'd expect from an Abacab-era Genesis. The only thing that makes you remember it's on Invisible Touch is the ""Oh-oh-oh""'s.  In Too Deep - -3/10- YUCK. I can't even make it through 30 seconds of this sugar-coated trash.  Anything She Does - 4/10 - Starts off like a fun, catchy song, but gets on your nerves quickly. It's Mozart compared to the previous song, though.  Domino - 11/10 - The genious in Genesis is back here. It's got the theme of Supper's Ready, but not quite the same songwise. Great song, though, the live version is even better!

Peppers album is upside down (just like the vinyl LP), the cutouts are all there, the MMT booklet looks exactly the same as the vinyl LP version, each CD has a small duplicate of the vinyl slip cover that can be used to hold the CD, and the CD's themselves look like the original vinyl pressings.  2) Overall sound quality.  Since this is the first time that all the mono versions have been released on CD, it's obviously hard to compare them to anything else but bootlegged needledrops.  I think that hard-core fans will not be disappointed, going on what I've heard so far.  Using the mono 1987 CD's as a baseline, the new remasters are superior - it is subtle, but definitely noticeable (like some ""sonic grime"" has been removed from the master tapes).  3) Differences between the mono and stereos versions.  For the uninitiated, the mono mixes are not fold-downs from the stereo mixes (in other words, that the mono mixes are not just the stereo mixes converted to mono).  These mixes are completely different - the majority of them were created before the stereo mixes (with MMT and The White Album being the turning point where the Beatles started looking more deeply at stereo).  In some cases, the differences are subtle  - but, in other cases (like ""Helter Skelter"", ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" or ""She's Leaving Home"") the differences are very noticeable.  Whether or not these versions are ""better"" than their stereo counterparts has been an endless argument for Beatles fans, for decades.  4) The price.  Unfortunately, EMI has treated the mono set as a ""limited"" edition and the price reflects that.  You get fewer CD's, but the excellent packaging more than makes up for the difference.  I only wish that they had added packaging for Abbey Road / Let It Be / Yellow Submarine CD's, even if they didn't include the actual stereo-only CD's with them.  That would have been the icing on the cake.  Overall, this set is a real treat and I think that Beatles fans will definitely enjoy them.",5,"09 9, 2009",Hard-core Beatles fans will be pleased.

Closer in style to Jennifer than Paulina -which is probably a good thing seeing as Paulina's attempt to break the English-speaking market sunk without a second hit, ""Thalia"" is a seriously well-made disc but would we expect anything less from MRS Tommy Mottola?! Supported by a force of invincible songwriters and producers, every track has been made to be a radio hit and actually could be! Moving forward from the cheesy latin dance hits that have made her a star, Thalia has chosen to go ""Urban Pop"" for her long-awaited, English-language debut. Some of the cheeky sparkle has gone but it's true that this is a more mature, sophisticated sound that the US and the world will lap up. This is Thalia's ""Forever Your Girl"" and it will propel her to the dizzy heights of the pop world that Urban Pop queen Paula Abdul reached with her debut disc way back when. First single, the Cory Rooney worked ""I want you"", is outrageously catchy and has hit radio at the right time; just as Jennifer takes a break! Second single is going to be the Ric Wake produced ""Baby, I'm in love""(with the one I'm with); a heady combination of sexy, mid-tempo beats and another infectious, rock-guitar driven chorus. Other highlights include the Cathy Dennis enhanced ""Misbehavin'"" -which would been just as good had it gone to Kylie, that other multi-platinum sex kitten, ""Save the day"" -which recalls Whitney at the height of her pop-dance days, and the English version of party favourite ""Tu Y Yo"". Of course, no Latin Diva is a real success without her Spanish-speaking fanbase and her Gay contingent, so of course this album is complete with Spanish-sung re-takes and a full-length (yes: 9 minutes!) dance remix of recent club hit ""Dance Dance (The Mexican)"" by hotter-than-hot remix king Hex Hector.

779,435378,ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000058BF8,Lord Chimp,False,"_A Predator's Portrait_ further establishes Soilwork as the leader of the Swedish metal scene (as long as you take Opeth out of the equation -- Opeth is beyond any description as pedestrian as ""metal""). If you examine their individual qualities in a critical vacuum, they are easily compared to a number of other Swedish metal artists, such as In Flames, At the Gates, or Dark Tranquillity. However, when you observe their perfected interlacing of familiar elements, you see the reasons that this band is simply my favorite in the genre, bar none. Soilwork busts out of the gates with the force of a derailed train, evident from the get-go with the pummeling opener ""Bastard Chain"". It eviscerates with bloodthirsty riffing and an aggressive disregard for melody that makes the chorus nearly indecipherable from the rest of it all. The guitar leads are uniformly stunning and set a high standard that each song easily meets. Soilwork eases up a bit after the opener, but not by too much. The music remains heavy but with some guitar harmonies and a bit of clean vocals, there's a bit of melody to go along with it. ""Needlefeast""'s glistening guitar harmonies and its forlorn-but-infectious chorus is good contrast, although it really loses none of its aggression for its melodic factor. The whole albums is heavy +++. Even ""The Analyst"", which is perhaps the catchiest song here, is still combative metal and loses practically none of its aggressive bite. But there's a drama to the music to go along with the intensity. ""Grand Failure Anthem"" has a tragic weight thrown upon the shoulders of its listener, contributed equally by Speed's desperate vocals and also the grave tenor of the mammoth riffing. ""Structure Divine"" is coarse and fast, but eerie and dark. ""A Predator's Portrait"" is punishing yet enchantingly surreal. ""Shadowchild"", possibly my favorite Soilwork song of them all, is thrashy but balances with a certain pleading emotion with riffs that sound like a theme for the apocalypse. The keyboards have little presence, but you _would_ notice a significant change if they were somehow taken out. They accentuate the color of the music, oh so subtly, juxtaposing a somewhat surreal quality against the brutal guitar framework. More so on _Natural Born Chaos_ Svennson's keyboards _add_ to the music, but _A Predator's Portrait_ still wouldn't be the same without them, if that makes sense. And by the way, the guitar solos are awesome. And to further establish this band's good taste, the title track features the demon god himself, Mikael Akerfeldt. Akerfeldt sings cleanly for chorus with a poignancy that only his distinct voice can provide. The contrast of Akerfeldt's chilling croon with Speed's abrasive voice is weird and sick but good. A quick note: The tracklisting Amazon has for this CD is different than my own. I have a Nuclear Blast pressing out of Europe somewhere, and it doesn't have the song ""Asylum Dance"". That's a drag, because more Soilwork is always good! The song order is different on my CD too. Be educated! Don't end up with the one I have! You'll miss out! And then you'll be mad!

One of the songs on that collection was an updated acid jazz version of the title song of this album,and along with other songs there it featured Roy Ayers. Had absolutely no idea who the man was until hearing that. And this began a voracious time of crate digging searching for music by the man that,during the mid/late 90's wasn't particularly easy to come by in my neck of the woods. It was actually earlier this year that I got a CD copy of this album-featuring the tune that started it all for me with this artist.    ""Hey Uh-What You Say Come On"",""The Golden Rod"",""People And The World"" and ""It' Ain't Your Sign,It's Your Mind"" are all intensely percussive Afro-Cuban jazz-funk jams full of beautiful harmonic passages,exciting compositional changes and otherworldly electronic melodies. ""Keep On Walking"",the mid tempo Salsa kjazzof ""The Third Eye"" and of course the dynamic title song are superb examples of funkiness taken it's slowest possible ballad tempos. ""You And Me My Love"",""Tongue Power"" and the comically romantic  closer ""Lonesome Cowboy"",dealing with the ""urban cowboy gets married"" theme are all thick,bassy hard funk-filled with horns and stomping drum breaks that  keep down the strongest groove possible.    Something about the mid 70's during which this was recorded just seemed to allow funkiness to be it's own lovely reward. Hearing this particular album now helps me understand the acid jazz/funk movement really pumping out of Europe during my teen years. The songs here have the funk and Afro Cuban rhythmic underpinnings that were always central to Roy Ayers sound. Yet he also bought in both lead and orchestral string synthesizers to add great melodic/harmonic color to the music. The way he uses them on this album?

When I  listen to HOTMK along with RFO, Crimson Glory, and King Diamond from that  era, HOTMK has not aged well and sounds the most dated.  With the exception  of ""Beyond the Doors of the Dark"" and ""Hall of the Mountain  King"", I'm not very fond of the rest of the songs.  Regarding these  two songs, they are awesome.  Especially ""Beyond..."" which may be  one of my ten favorite of alltime.  The line ""Screaming, thrash your  head, turn around now you're dead"" never fails to get my heart  pumping.  These two songs perfectly fit Jon Oliva's evil raspy voice.  I  rarely ever listen to this CD anymore since I prefer Savatage's more  symphonic sound.

I always loved Pat O'Briens riffs when he was in Nevermore, so it is cool to hear new CC albums with him in mind, he was made for this band.  He really loves this type of music and it shows in the riffs.  I am not discounting Owen and Barret because they truly are the sound that this band was known for, but truth is stagnation in lineups sometimes hurts, and death metal bands tend to love the revolving door to keep their music fresh.  The riffs are sick, the music is as tight as you would expect, the production is as thick and inviting as possible to stand out in this modern market where everything tends to be crystal clear to entice new listeners.  Think about it, Cannibal Corpse have been making brutal metal for around 20 years, and the metal genre is completely over saturated with dime-a-dozen ""brutal this"" and ""brutal that"" bands, mostly owing their souls to this band.  This one is kinda an example of ""been there done that"", but ""still doing it as good if not better then all these new kids wearing their sisters pants.""

It's a shame, because this band has an upper hand over  about any other metal band in terms of lyrics, arrangements, imagery, and  elegance.  But in this case, a death-metal vocal doesn't work at  all. That aside, the music has a grandness and majesty that transcends  the limiting confines of metal.  My Dying Bride does have a tendency to  meander -- instead of constructing disciplined songs, many wander into a  pattern and lapse into studio effects and weird noises (think Led  Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love"").

On further reflection perhaps this is not so surprising.  Both Dylan and Daniels are iconoclasts in their own way, and both have stayed true throughout their careers to their musical roots and not sold out.  Furthermore - a little known fact - Charlie Daniels was a session man for some of Dylan's early albums so his understanding and appreciation of Dylan's music is, no doubt, deep.  This is a really nice album!  Every thing about this album is done well.  The production and arrangements are outstanding, the Charlie Daniels band are exceptional musicians, and Daniels delivers spirited and energetic renditions of Dylan's songs.  My only reservation (and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars) is that on some songs Daniel's voice is a little too rough hewn, even for Dylan, and doesn't match well.

811,860549,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004K4AUZW,E. A. Solinas,False,"Heard of Lady Gaga? She's this loopy pop singer with weird hair and clothes, and most people either love her or hate her. Well, my personal opinion of Lady Gaga's persona won't come into this -- it's all about her new album, ""Born This Way."" Well, brace yourself: It's a bloated mess that rambles on far too long, with too many songs, too much noise, and no unifying style.  ""Born This Way"" presents itself as a gay anthem, and it does this by thumping you over the head with obvious shout-outs like ""Don't be a drag/just be a queen"" and ""No matter gay, straight or bi/Lesbian, transgendered life."" But all Madonna comparisons aside, this song is a mess -- the producers heaped so many layers of sound that it sometimes sounds like Gaga is being smothered.  Then there's ""Judas,"" the second single of this album. This suffers from the same choking overproduction as ""Born This Way,"" with Gaga's voice being smushed down under a thick fog of synthpop. Then again, she spends half the song squawking, ""Juda-JUDA-AW!"" like an epileptic goose, so that might be a good thing.  But what of the other songs? Well, the album actually starts quite strong with the dark, glittering ""Marry the Night,"" and the bleakly desperate sex-with-presidents thumper ""Government Hooker."" But things start going off the rails with the goopy romanticism of the Spanish-flavored ""Americano,"" the vaguely Germanic club melody ""Scheibe,"" and the cheesy ""Hair.""  After that, Gaga just... seems to stop trying, and lets the following songs decay into a soggy mess of mediocre club pop. Some of the songs barely have melodies (""Black Jesus - Amen Fashion,"" ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)""), and some are just so bland that it's hard to remember them (""The Queen""). I like ""Electric Chapel,"" but most of these songs could have been cut without anyone noticing.  She does rouse herself enough to give distinctive sounds to the last couple songs... but they're AWFUL sounds: ""You And I"" sounds like a country singer wandered into a dance club and just started singing, and ""The Edge of Glory"" is a horrendously cheesy power ballad, complete with SAXOPHONES.  In a nutshell, ""Born This Way"" is a huge bloated mess, bogged down with excess and collapsing under its own weight. It feels like Lady Gaga is trying to do EVERYTHING in this album. More sound! More musical genres! More random references to fashion, nightclubs, sex and gay people! More dance songs that nobody can remember when they're over!  As for Gaga's lyrics, they have some interesting elements, like the strong undercurrent of Catholic/religious symbolism and the idea that ""bad kids"" are just fine because they were ""born that way."" But her writing also tends to be insanely clumsy (""You're black, white, beige, chola descent/You're Lebanese, you're Orient""), and her symbolism is so obvious that it leaves bruises between your eyes.  And her voice? It's the strongest part of any song where she tries, but too often it falls by the wayside in this album. In some songs, it's swamped by all those electronic layers, and in some songs she just sort of croons without putting any effort into it.  If they had trimmed off the B-sides and the extra production, ""Born This Way"" could have been a pretty decent pop album. But instead, it feels like a collapsing monument to pop excess.",2,"05 23, 2011",Born that way,1306108800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},10.0,,give collapse fall ballad second hooker sex-with-presidents bloat rail weird transgendered hard power black lyric pop much spanish-flavored effort quite head orient country b-sides way heap like horrendously clothes mess extra start straight glitter choking could songs start edge come heard half electronic nobody fine actually might write bruise croons lebanese goopy cheesy bleakly night last madonna romanticism dark gaga's many gay spends thing germanic barely anyone enough tend seem desperate feel element club swamp eye musical loopy song fog stop long nutshell genres interesting thump drag/just huge thick soggy anthem thing suffers obvious smushed sex love persona brace part new gaga comparison aside vaguely descent/you're layer electric cut hair undercurrent americano try wayside far try leaf unicorn juda-juda-aw go sounds ramble good single singing overproduction random bogged couple marry juda goose thumper amen singer weight smother remember monument government hate sort let bland reference album melody white sometimes glory jesus everything bad symbolism also highway decent production complete clumsy voice start matter fashion opinion excess epileptic road nightclub sound noticing kid idea put catholic/religious either producer chapel strong born trim insanely style melody distinctive present often mediocre instead without queen life shout-outs unifying chola saxophone noise there's people rouse beige well they're strong squawk decay awful scheibe synthpop personal bi/lesbian lady dance pretty follow wander

I know, it's kind of a shame to call myself a rock and roll fan and not own at least ""Let it Bleed"" but I did get around to buying the classic albums from the late 60's, early 70's.  The first disc does a great job of collecting singles and album tracks from their bluesy, superior 60's era when they competed with the Beatles.  All the great albums ""Beggars Banquet,"" ""Let it Bleed,"" ""Aftermath,"" etc etc have material here.  But their should be more a la ""Hot Rocks"" (which is better than this collection, i must say). The second disc is a mess.  It becomes obvious while listening here that they are still in competition with the Beatles; they needed something to contend with the Beatles ""1.""  80's, 90's, and 2000's material sitting next to tracks from ""Exile on Main Street"" just seems wrong...

Much to my dismay, I have only been a fan for a little over a year. I heard TD&A on a sampler which came with The Spill Canvas's CD One Fell Swoop, and I was hooked. The next pay day I went out and bought this CD. It's simply brilliant. They are all intelligent boys and one can easily tell from their lyrics and music that this is not your average indie rock band. More akin to Mae then they are to The Spill Canvas, TD&A is more mellow than they are rockers. Though they can rock with the best in their genre, and for the most part, better (""Hourglass"" ""A New Focus""). Not to be clich&eacute;, but the word that comes to mind when I think of This Day and Age is ""lush."" It's been described as piano-driven pop rock (""Second Place Victory"" ""Long Walk Home""), but don't confuse them for Jack's Mannequin. And if by chance you are a fan of their second album The Bell and The Hammer, and wondering if this CD is just as good, I will be honest: no. It is more on the edge of the pop-punk spectrum at this point in their careers (""Seven-Eighty"" ""The Day We Started""), and it lacks some of the beauty and brilliance of their second full-length, but it is a solid album and would/should be enjoyed by any lovers of smart, emotional indie rock.

The total experience (perfect sound, enthralling videos, Steven's masterful command of the band and crowd, superior musicianship) was unlike any concert I've ever been to, and I'm pushing 60.  A minute into ""Three Years Older"", I was enraptured, literally wondering how any earthly experience could be so perfect, so moving, so unparalleled.  I couldn't (and still can't) adequately explain how overwhelmed I was.  I attended the show with a friend, and we noticed the next tour leg was in Dallas, where my friend (a pilot) would be the night of the show.  Had next day airfare not been ridiculously expensive, I would have gladly taken a sick day or two to see this masterpiece again.

You would think that after Joe had attained a certain level of success, his song-writing style would mature. After the enormous success of his previous CD ""My Name Is Joe"", he should be writing songs about Swiss bank accounts and making love in limos, mansions, private jets and yatchs instead of Jeeps, rims and the like. I like Joe's previous CD's much better because most of the songs, while sexually suggestive in nature, at least had substance and contained some element of romance & sophistication. However, the songs on this disc are just plain lacking in substance & originality. ""More & More"" is off the hook, that's why I purchased the CD in the first place. The other songs are kinda catchy in their own way, e.g. ""And Then..."" and ""Priceless"", but everything else is pretty much repeating the same old ghetto-minded materialistic/sex themes ad nauseam. I give this CD 2 stars because, while it's not a total waste, it's just not something you'd want to listen to everyday, especially if you're trying to get your lady in the mood.

847,365035,A1WQNQAK4XJZL4,B00000IO83,seb,False,"... Orbital has changed from the mysterious, deeply solemn ""In Sides"" into a more plastic-coated sound, with alot of bright synth and breaks that are seeming to emulate the early-style found on their debut album. In comparison to their older work, Orbital finds themselves on a different wavelength on The Middle Of Nowhere. Some songs may have the bright, sonic progression of ""Chime"" but when it really comes down to the base, it is alot different than Orbital's other albums. Very uplifting and intoxicating, this album takes you far far away. The range of influence on this album is incredible; one song you have strings, a lead synth, and brass and on another you have a hardcore drum beat. The album works very well as a whole though, and the songs flow along like few artist albums can. Pop the disc in your stereo and you will find it hard to press the stop button. It launches right on off with ""Way Out,"" an exotic, far-eastern sounding synthetic exploration. A definent highlight. It leads right on into ""Spare Parts Express,"" a 10 minute song full of different breaks and textures. The rhythm previals throughout though and the songs ends triumphantly. ""Know Where To Run"" is a disappointing track without much build or character. Probably worst track on the album, but nothing crippling. ""I Don't Know You People"" brings forth paranoid vocal samples with some crazy electric guitar and synth to bring you a really good song. One of Orbital's more edgey. Que ""Otono"" (for those of you not educated in spanish, Otono means Autumn). Spacey, lustral vocals and a wicked lo-fi drum beat for a mind-shifting experience. It's only 5 minutes in length, one of Orbital's shortest songs, but it accomplishes what it needs to in it's time (like the following LP The Alotgether). The two-part ""Nothing Left"" is next. The first part is a bit deeper and sinister than Orbital is known for, but the second part is shimmering and wonderful, changing up the vocal sample and sticking in a hard synth line.

848,145967,A1KYHC3ZXAJICU,B000002GNC,Grateful Jerry,False,"The Best of The Moody Blues was first released in January 1997 and tied in with the start of Universal's then remaster campaign with the band's core 7 albums. The disc runs a full 77 minutes but unfortunately, it omits any songs by Ray Thomas who was still in the band at the time and former member Michael Pinder. Both Ray and Mike contributed equally to the band's albums. Mike left in '78 and Ray was still contributing a fair amount to albums all the way through The Present in 1983. The Other Side of Life (1986) and Sur la Mer (1988) are the only albums here that he really didn't contribute to due to health reasons so his omission here is quite bad. The album does include Go Now which was recorded by the pre Hayward/Lodge line up with Denny Laine/Clint Warwick.  The disc also includes a couple of songs from a couple of Justin's side projects. Blue Guitar was a song Justin recorded before Blue Jays with 10cc but ended up as a single credited to the Blue Jays. Neither John Lodge or any of the other Blue Jays actually play on it. Forever Autumn was a song for Jeff Wayne's musical adaption of War of the Worlds with Justin making a guest appearance on guitar and vocal. In fact, Justin originally turned it down but was talked into it by someone who worked for the band's Threshold Records (not the label but the chain of record stores the band used to own).

It doesn't need to scream loudly to be heard, because the beauty in the music projects itself naturally. I was first introduced to the work of Badly Drawn Boy (who is really the one-man act of Manchester native Damon Gough) through his song ""The Shining."" At first, the track seemed a bit bland and nondescript, but this slice of folk pop perfection quickly grew on me more after each listen, as I was also drawn by Gough's spoken vocals. Completely intrigued, I had to run out and buy this disc, and I'm so glad I did. Much of ""Have You Fed the Fish"" is just as good--if not better--than that song, as it offers mellowed guitar pop with smart, self-examining lyrics and occaisonal Beatlesque touches. Definite key tracks are the sweet confections of ""You Were Right,"" ""Tickets to What You Need,"" and the excellent closer ""Bedside Story.""

858,1179602,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B0000073K4,Armando M. Mesa,False,"Unlike some other listeners who discovered or knew Sandra's material first and then her affiliation with the new age,ambient band Enigma, it was the reverse for me;First Enigma, then Sandra...She was never given any American promo or exposure from Virgin Records and remained only popular in the 80's elsewhere around the globe.  This release appeared the same year(1990) as Enigma's MCMXC a. D. album;Actually, months before the Enigma project had launched. There are obvious trace sound and musical elements and themes (the track ""The Journey"" being the strongest) to resemble what Sandra's husband Cretu would utilize or morph into the Enigma project. By this time, Sandra  had already moved from Germany and was living in Spain for two years while recording music on the island of Ibiza through the use of her husband's state-of-the-art A.R.T. Studios set up. Producer-husband Michael Cretu spared no expense and used the most polished and sophisticated synthesizer and electronic recording equipment and techniques (at the time); It shows! The results on this album display the more introspective and mature signature sound that Sandra was undergoing; Gone were the outdated harsh electronic synth machinations,pop-dance and teen subject matters from the 80's that had catapulted her into international stardom (from her days with the female Euro group Arabesque to her solo debut in 1985 to 1988 period).Paintings in Yellow illustrates a more warm approach to the music. A few themes centered on the Hiroshima bomb victims (Hiroshima re-make originally recorded in the 70's by Wishful Thinking) as well as animal cruelty and animal rights activist global issues with the track Johnny Wanna Live; A track that I had originally misinterpreted and thought it was about some teen age angst issue a la Rebel Without A Cause---maybe a teen involved with drugs or alcohol issues. Johnny Wanna Live would later be covered by British pop-opera vocalist Sarah Brightman(though, Sarah's version is approached in a more minimalist and slower tempoed nature---I prefer the original version by Sandra). Other highlights include the smooth blend of R&B,dance pop elements on Lovelight In Your Eyes. This track almost has an early Janet Jackson vibe or feel---it is comprised of catchy hooks ,toe tappin' material with a sweet bass line. It remains one of my more favorite tracks on the album as well as a non-record charting hit by Sandra;It's a hidden gem or sleeper hit that got away!""One More Night"" is pure romantic balladry which also demonstrates the pre-Enigma sound;It's fantastic. The album climaxes to the five part song suite entitled ""The Journey""---this one is a sure and sheer segue into the band project Enigma that Sandra would join with,then hubby, Michael Cretu and Frank Peterson. The Journey is moody,stark,serious,somber---very much in contrast with the previous songs on the album!  Paintings In Yellow marks a whole new and different artistic direction and thought provoking territory for this French-German pop singer. Her voice to many will have that distinctive 80's almost-nasal pop sound---but it is a charming voice nevertheless (think Paula Abdul or any other pop singer of that era). However, Sandra's vocal ability lies in her seductive and I'll even say sexy, fawning,breathy European quality! Once you hear her voice, then,and only then, will you recognize that it's the nature and character that captivates and not whether she can hit those notes like an opera singer (she can't). The music style is creatively produced to fit and suit her vocal ability---even enhances it!",5,"04 8, 1999",Various Shades of Yellow,923529600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},3.0,,"enigma think resemble romantic lovelight project lie sandra's approach mcmxc electronic feel---it favorite sandra...she many sure different later note song direction janet ability paula entitle peterson polish warm comprise part original state-of-the-art hiroshima suit charm slow ability---even singer a.r.t almost version jackson theme la would hear track blend demonstrate hit band include release sound victim hide show nevertheless spar set two record without nature---i undergoing stardom british hook captivates with,then virgin female opera much think husband's record like sheer trace character abdul matter tempoed group studio can't brightman(though element covered musical misinterpret chart teen involve approach obvious one introspective remain new suite whole r&b,dance material sweet arabesque appear johnny germany hubby day almost-nasal first island catapult time reverse live affiliation issue bomb also mature voice ibiza moody,stark,serious,somber---very solo five year catchy enigma's style distinctive enhances wishful album;actually creatively segue originally harsh right provoke give elsewhere record climax vocal sound---but i'll use listener then,and territory expense yellow however prefer tappin song think night sarah journey michael contrast bass european artistic morph music outdated debut go quality discover american highlight vibe animal synthesizer use cause---maybe drug fit promo whether early sandra;it's produce center get globe vocalist angst age,ambient sleeper global wanna gem equipment previous balladry alcohol know well say spain age track seductive join pop minimalist remain smooth non-record move result launch re-make me;first cruelty nature already eye activist unlike line international fawning,breathy cretu pure issue pop-opera technique subject sarah's machinations,pop-dance popular utilize sexy live rebel recognize journey""---this month display away!""one album fantastic mark period).paintings synth euro producer-husband painting even husband sound;it's never around signature french-german illustrates frank sophisticated toe pre-enigma strongest exposure sandra era"

Is that two much? well, maybe but the are good tracks.  As a whole, this album works-really well.  Natalies vocal ability is a lot more evident on here.

It seems these guys have come out of nowhere considering I've had trouble finding some informative reading material about the group. Their website isn't that great. I did, however, see Erol Alkan produced the album, supposedly a notable DJ out of London. I suppose that has to be some kind of representation for promise.  Exploring other reviews, I've seen many comparisons to Gary Numan and Frank Zappa, but I can neither agree nor disagree since I've never listened to either of those two much. Fantasy Black Channel is very quirky, poppy, electronic, and full of synth. Simply put, it's party music. Immediately there are similarities to Franz Ferdinand and The Killers, two groups who've successfully hit the pop scene. I'm not sure Late of the Pier will reach that status, though.

No, Late of the Pier can't do that, but a few of their songs are fairly akin - ""Space & The Woods"" and ""Focker."" The beats and guitar (or bass, whatever it is) are awesome. Going back to the producer, Erol Alkan, it may be worth knowing in the past he remixed music from both Death From Above 1979 and Franz Ferdinand. It's just an interesting tidbit. Also, at times I think of David Bowie and subsequently Flight of the Conchords mocking him.  Fantasy Black Channel isn't that bad despite all the rehashing, even if the flow of the album is all over the place.

His work on albums like The Velvet Undergound and Nico and Loaded is amazing, but when he was left to his own devices, he sometimes made albums like Metal Machine Music that are more or less unlistenable.  Solo projects from members of amazing bands are often a spotty affair, of course; The Beatles are the greatest band of all time, but when you listen to most of their solo albums, youll agree that they needed each other (and George Martin) to really shine. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards gave the world masterpieces like Let It Bleed and Exile on Main St, but I probably wouldnt listen to any of their solo albums again. For every musician who leaves a great group and records masterpieces on their own (like Paul Simon), theres plenty of artists who really do benefit from collaborating with others.  Thats whats so remarkable about Transformer; its not a masterpiece like The Velvet Undergound and Nico, but it is an excellent record that fans of the group will surely love. Tracks like Walk on the Wild Side, Satellite of Love, and the heartbreaking Perfect Day showcase Lou Reed as an amazing songwriterand the production by David Bowie is really strong.

I've had the good fortune of seeing him live at the quaint little Blue Door Club here in Okla. City. A place where he plays often and always puts on a fantastic show. The critics haven't always been kind to him in the past with their reviews (whatta they know anyway) but the one thing Lafave has always had going for him is that great voice. His vocals can be silky smooth, as on Bob Dylan's ""Emotionally Yours"", or the reworking of the John Phillips classic ""San Francisco"". A song I always thought was a little wimpy, that is until Lafave got a hold of it and added better vocals and arrangements to it. He also has a roadhouse rockin' side, and displays it on this album more so than any of his past efforts. I like the Tulsa style rockers of ""Poor Man's Dream"" and ""Patient Man"", a song that was written by Greg Jacobs, the owner of the Blue Door Club. But he gets his rowdiest on the songs ""On The Road To Rock And Roll"" and the old Ten Years After rock classic ""Rock And Roll Music To The World"", where he changes the lyrics around and uses a lot of references to Texas and his native Oklahoma.

But it is a discredit to his musical talent. Don't know what I mean? Read on.   SIGN 'O' THE TIMES is the best Prince album ever. It is also the most underated album of the '80's. It surpasses all of his sucess before and also shows his ability to make use of the synthesizer without making the songs sound dated.   Sign 'O' The Times is a bleak but effective opener, showing Prince's awareness of events around the world and was a top ten in in the UK and US. What follows is pure celebration and funk. 'Housequake' shows Prince at his funkiest. The perfect blend of James Brown and George Clinton. 'It' is typical Prince, willing to do 'it' anytime and anywhere and is best described through the drum machine and synths that carry it to it's superb climax. 'Hot Thing' and 'Forever In My Life' show that he is capable of making sparse tracks sound very effective. 'U Got The Look' is the most kinkiest song on the album featuring the sassy Sheena Easton. 'If I Was Your Girlfriend' is, in my view, Prince's most adventurous track and best shows his ability to experiment, whatever the subject he is talking about. 'The Cross' is 'Purple Rain' part 2 but is much harder and the lyrics are more intelligent and the drumming is even better. 'It's Gonna Be A Beautiful Night' is a great live band performance and also points in the direction of James Brown. 'Adore' closes the album on a high and also takes a leaf out the Marvin Gaye seduction manual. But the song that deserves the biggest mention is 'I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man', a simple but top-drawer pop-rock track which is his most underated single. Although it made the US top 10, it only made the top 30 in the UK and for me, this shows the narrow-mindedness of the public. This song starts off with some of his best vocal works and a simple and effective keyboard riff and moves into screaching guitar solos. This is his best guitar playing by a mile, even overtaking 'Let's Go Crazy'. The key change which sees him playing blues guitar sound like pre Eric Clapton. Six and a half minutes of pure genius and the definitve Prince song.

The band toured extensively, and then sorta disappeared from the scene. One of the reasons was that they were working hand in hand with director Derek Clanfrance to provide a soundtrack for the movie ""Blue Valentine"". That movie was released in December, 2010, and scored Michelle Williams a ""Best Actress"" Oscar nomination, and deservedly so. Some months after the movie came out, this soundtrack was released on CD.  ""Blue Valentine"" (15 tracks; 61 min.) brings a smorgasbord of Grizzly Bear music, some new music (such as the dreamy opening track ""Granny Diner""), but mostly older tracks brought in a new mix or as an instrumental. We get ""Easier"", ""Lullabye"" and ""Foreground"" in a new instrumental version, and later in the soundtrack in their original version. The key section of the soundtrack is found in tracks 3 through 7, all of them instrumental tracks from Grizzly Bear, and hauntingly beautiful, check out ""Easier"", originally from the ""Yellow House"" album, and also the new track ""I Live With You"" (which reminds me for some reason of Genesis era-Wind & Wuthering). As for the non-Grizzly Bear music on here: ""In Ear Park"" (from Department of Eagles) sounds just like Grizzly Bear (because it is a side project from one of the Grizzly guys). Ryan Gosling's heartbraking rendering of ""You Always Hurt the One You Love"" is also included. and then there is this little nugget, ""You and Me"", from Penny & the Quarters, just fantastic.  In all, it is bewildering to me why this soundtrack was released under the radar, so to speak, with hardly any promotion or support from the label. I think of ""Blue Valentine"" as Grizzly Bear's sadly 'forgotten' album, as it certainly stands on its own within Grizzly Bear's catalog. The band just released a new album ""Shields"", to great acclaim. I saw Grizzly Bear in concert again just last month at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, in support of the new album. Great show.

902,605523,AY678Q6IMJ5OX,B00096J1X2,Lane R. Miller,True,"I got into Progressive Metal about two years ago with Dream Theater's Train of Thought.  Ever since, I have been trying to find bands that provide the same thrill.  With determination, I found two: Symphony X and Vanden Plas.  Now, I have found the fourth band to entering this lofty distinction in my CD collection:  Pagan's Mind.  With Enigmatic: Calling, Pagan's Mind blends almost non-stop energy with excellent musicianship.  The CD starts off strong with The Celestine Prophecy with a repeated sequence of seven crunching cords.  The CD then transcends to the stratosphere with Enigmatic Mission, Supremacy Our Kind and Entrance to Infinity, a three-song back-to-back tour de force.  Enigmatic Mission has a roaring riff with very unique vocals soaring over the top from Nils Rue, who a times reminds me of Ian Gillan and at other times sounds like Graham Bonnet.  The song includes a very flashy guitar solo from Jorn Viggo Lofstad, who for me is the star of this star studded CD.  In style, Jorn reminds me of the best of a hybrid Petrucci/Van Halen.  Supremacy Our Kind may be the most progressive song with several changes in tempo and heaviness.  Entrance to Infinity probably has the most addictive vocal melody.  The lyrics are interesting throughout, all based on alien and cosmic imagery.  Stian Kristoffersen is a maniac drummer - listen to the end of Taken.  Steinar Krokmo lays down an exellent foundation with the six string bass, and Ronny Tegner provides plenty of texture with the keyboards, not to mention several exceptional solos.  With heavy sophisticated riffs, complex arrangements, stunning solos and inhuman vocals, Enigmatic: Calling is a feast for Progressive Metal fans and is in my opinion the best release of the year!",5,"08 27, 2005",Knocks Me Out!,1125100800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},4.0,,halen texture seven lyric vocal entrance find thought star complex soar riff plas like inhuman ever vocal foundation hybrid mission transcends start determination arrangement supremacy six time stud listen crunch musicianship symphony several three-song distinction force take unique kristoffersen fourth song bass non-stop fan train call thrill find provide interesting tour gillan krokmo nil vanden steinar cosmic change viggo ian petrucci/van exellent solo string addictive try exceptional drummer kind feast sound graham probably stun collection energy alien flashy jorn bonnet almost cord stratosphere remind stian band infinity repeat mind get riff rue dream sequence imagery metal melody top blend ronny lay lofty cd ago provide plenty band solo year opinion progressive release theater's guitar de enter back-to-back roaring style tempo since best two keyboard lofstad tegner mention excellent include celestine throughout end sophisticated heavy maniac year prophecy base strong heaviness may enigmatic pagan's

905,409670,A2SU6CA6HSK85I,B00004T9AF,mathew,False,"I've got nothing against remasterings, or even re-recordings. The re-recording of Philip Glass's ""Einstein On The Beach"", for example, is far more powerful than the original. If only the same were true of Tubular Bells.  It's a common truism amongst artists that if you work and re-work a piece of art too much, you work all the life and spontaneity out of it. That seems to have happaned here. Yes, the recordings of the instruments are all cleaner and sharper, but there's a processed homogeneity to the whole thing, with every sequenced beat being just a little too perfect, every guitar note just a bit too smooth and consistent.  There are some specific flaws too. Piltdown man with vocoders? Please. The original was murky, primitive and threatening; this new version is just silly. Similarly, John Cleese should have been discouraged from camping it up, rather than having ""Mandolin!"" sampled like a Max Headroom quip. It's symptomatic of the fact that where the original was earnest and a touch angry in places, this new version sounds jokey and artificial. Maybe the Mike Oldfield of 2003 views it as a joke album, or perhaps it's all about the money.  As a final note, I still think the original intended ending of ""Tubular Bells"" is far better than the cheesy synth Sailor's Hornpipe used on the first release, and inexplicably kept for this re-recording. You'll only hear the real ending on the version of TB included in ""Boxed"".

""It Moves Me"" collects just about all of Eddie Holland's recorded output at Motown, before he decided to stop recording and concentrate on song-writing with his brother and Lamont Dozier. This cd begins with the earliest recordings and progresses chronologically. You can hear Eddie's fine voice from the earliest cuts, and the songs reflect the increasing quality of material that Motown was putting out. Yes, there are a few clunkers, as Mr. Holland admits in the excellent liner notes, but the majority of songs represent the era well, with some standing out exceptionally well. ""Jamie"" is here, as well as the UK-loved ""Leaving Here"". There are many songs here that will most likely be heard by many people (myself included) for the first time, but maybe not for the hard-core Motown collector, or for those fortunate enough to have Eddie Holland's only album on vinyl. There are some great early H-D-H penned songs, as well as some by Eddie solo and with others (like Norman Whitfield). Some stand-outs include the aforementioned ""Jamie"" and ""Leaving Here"", ""Magic Mirror"", ""Just A Few More Days"", and ""I'm On The Outside Looking In"" (not the Little Anthony and the Imperials one, either!).

Where others try for cosmic climaxes and rich chocolate sonority, Tintner is content to give us less. His Royal Scottish orchestra doesn't pretend to be the Berlin Phil, and their modesty suits Tintner's own.  As you keep listening, this reading sounds more and more genuine. It really helps t love a composer without smothering him with reverence. Tintner's Seventh is affectionate, and it's allowed to breathe. Be prepared for sosme clunky rhythms and four-square phrases. Each cadence definitely starts and stops. But within those limits, it's gratifying to hear Bruckner in a gentler, more humanized mode.

For music listeners who appreciate their artists aging and their musical output growing in kind, then this just might be a very good album. I truly adore the ballads while dislike most of the harder rocking tunes (which is not unlike my views of his works throughout his solo repertoire.)  To me, the song selection is a nice representation of Robert's blues background and certainly reflects his growing heart toward spirituality and humanity. Sadly, his voice falters mightily on this album. But, his renditions of such classics as DARKNESS DARKNESS and MORNING DEW are heartfelt and truly beautiful. His version of HEY JOE seems trite and even a bit out of place, considering the lack of humanity within the songs subject when compared to so many others recorded from PRINCIPLES OF MOMENTS, FATE OF NATIONS and even NOW AND ZEN.  After listening to this set... it is easy to understand Robert's later admonition of no longer being a fan of ""heavy metal"" (of which thousands of arrested adolescent fans of Led Zeppeling irrationally screached and squalled.)

939,927352,A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B009B91VD6,Kingcrimsonprog,False,"Parkway Drive are an Australian Metalcore band (who call themselves a Hardcore Band) from the beautiful Byron Bay area, notable for their unconventionally interesting travelogue-esque documentary releases. 2012's Atlas is their fourth full-length studio album. It was produced by Matt Hyde and released on Epitah Records.  If you aren't familiar with the band they may initially appear to lack a clear identifying hook or quirk to differentiate themselves from all the other Metalcore bands out there. If you only heard six seconds of music for example you may not be instantly able to tell that its specifically Parkway Drive and not someone else. If you hear an entire song or album however it will probably become clear that Parkway Drive's real selling point however is that they simply do it so very, very well.  Besides a signature standard of quality, the band have always had a signature sound that they largely stick within (much like AC/DC, Slayer, Hatebreed or Killswitch Engange do) and like all of their albums before, the majority of the music on Atlas is no grand departure from the type of music that you would expect the band to play.  The band evolve slowly from album to album, as opposed to suddenly being a Jazz band on one album and then playing a mixture of Country Music and Black Metal on the next. The good thing about this is that if you like what they do, you get more of it. The bad thing is that if you are sick of it, you get more of it, and it'll take a few albums until the sound has evolved enough to be considered notably different.  Whether you view it as staying true to their core ideals or a lack of variety will ultimately depend on you. Personally, I'm happy with the band's ratio of evolution and stylistic-stability. On this album, tracks like `Swing,' `Dark Days' and `Sleight Of Hand' are all examples of exactly what Parkway Drive do best and any one of them would serve as a fine introduction to the band for a newcomer or reaffirmation for an existing fan.  The same syncopated double-kicks are there, the same breaks of effects-laden clean guitar are there, the same mix of shouts and death vocals (and notable absence of commercial sounding radio-friendly clean choruses) from frontman Winston McCall are there and the same crunchy, low-pitched rhythmic breakdowns are there as always. There are also some sections of gang-chanting backing vocals here and there and intermittent touches of lead guitar and a small amount of blast beats as usual.  Within that familiar sound however; Atlas can still provide a few surprises, most notably on the Title Track which features a string section, on `The River' which has female vocals briefly and on `The Slow Surrender' which is uncharacteristically structured, comparatively slow and features turntable scratching.  Some fans may reject the additions or cry sell out, but at the end of the day as long as you are a Parkway Drive fan to begin with, all that should matter is whether or not the songs are any good, and luckily they are good. Very good indeed.  There are some seriously great riffs, memorable vocal patterns, fun tom-rolls and catchy breakdowns on this album and practically no song is devoid of something to make you grin, filled as they are with little touches like hitting the bell on the ride at a certain point or ending a riff with a vibrato. The sort of thing that you pick up on with repeat listens and grow to love.  Overall; As long as you like the band to begin with and haven't got tired their formula yet then you'll probably love Atlas. It is a well constructed, excellently produced collection of yet more Parkway Drive songs to enjoy. There may be some debate within the fanbase as to exactly where this ranks against other Parkway Drive albums but regardless of the outcome of that debate, it is still undoubtedly a very good album that you should absolutely consider adding to your collection.",5,"10 30, 2012",Parkway Drive - Atlas,1351555200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,vibrato reaffirmation sell fanbase slow hardcore heard fine mccall rhythmic pattern matt metalcore breakdowns get thing expect briefly different rank song outcome happy fun bell evolution hook surrender tell ratio river point release notable type documentary cry variety besides would structure metal hear travelogue-esque familiar track bad practically full-length band listen sound crunchy ultimately release excellently stick overall construct example engange may departure small female black much view amount drive luckily record enjoy riff like vocal section usual reject ac/dc title australian dark suddenly within winston sell long oppose consider one instantly personally death love beat byron string exist double-kicks day become bay certain band call also still newcomer memorable atlas album catchy play initially appear serve surprise yet back introduction epitah fill always devoid exactly clear formula tom-rolls mixture vocal hand country end however true song simply regardless slayer differentiate core area next identify hatebreed enough uncharacteristically take tired scratching largely fan interesting music little killswitch entire blast quality radio-friendly beautiful ideal able seriously good consider intermittent add whether evolve produce get swing stay standard indeed provide turntable gang-chanting parkway majority chorus make debate i'm best break quirk sleight sound well undoubtedly track depend hyde examples touch effects-laden someone ride six specifically sick absence stylistic-stability pick something great fourth real clean begin notably addition grow play slowly probably grin collection lack commercial studio low-pitched sort frontman album riff comparatively fan matter else lead day mix it'll guitar second syncopate unconventionally grand shout signature band's section drive's evolved end repeat jazz hit absolutely feature

943,177511,A2F8A91OCBP4BM,B000002J1U,Amazon Customer,False,"Book-ended by the powerful Led Zeppelin II and the classic Led Zeppelin IV, Zep's third album is traditionally overlooked by casual listeners.  While III certainly doesn't have the immediate or lasting impact of its preceding or following releases, there is still a lot of great material to be found on the 45 minute transitional album.  Always renowned as the originators of heavy metal, Led Zeppelin were traditionally a hard rock, blues based band that specialized in solid rhythms and bone crunching riffs.  III however, showcased a different side of the band, discarding the commercially accessible hard rock persona in favor of the group's lesser noted low key, acoustic blues side that fans had always known was there, but most critics had been skeptical of.  Displaying a drastic change in Zeppelin's sound in comparison to the uniformly fuzzed out monolithic II, Led Zeppelin III has songs ranging from traditional acoustic blues to tight pants metal.  The frequent acoustic numbers and melodic overtones give III a much more textured and mood oriented feel than the band's earlier work and while the heavy songs still have an edge to them, they are scaled back significantly from the band's previous ""loud"" repertoire.  However, although it's overall much quieter, Zeppelin III by no means lacks the band's trademark spirited energy.  Instead of channeling the band's impressive energies directly into creating volume though, the immense passion of each song is used to generate added depth and emotion that's both complex and simple, lending itself well to the melancholy, reflective album.  Whether the laid back more lo-fi sound of III is an evolution or a step backwards for the band is up to the listener, but regardless of personal opinions, one still has to respect Led Zeppelin for trying something completely different that vastly exceeded the traditional range of most metal bands.  III is certainly not the definitive Led Zeppelin album, but it does represent a very important and normally enjoyable side of the band that failed to find a home on many other Zeppelin recordings.",5,"01 1, 2003",One of Zeppelin's most unqiue and different albums,1041379200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,give preceding noted hard significantly directly much find listener rock work spirit complex recording create lack overtone riff monolithic emotion however commercially powerful display song edge scale know traditional regardless lending completely vastly generate normally crunch tight enjoyable important passion iii immense many impact certainly change critic textured something great solid quieter traditionally transitional simple third different group's zep's feel mean song fan acoustic iv immediate although range find earlier melancholy that's evolution favor channel one depth persona lot back less number add release impressive definitive try low ii material specialize loud home use reflective energy lo-fi step minute whether lead frequent band pant melodic mood fail album metal energy originator uniformly accessible bone key orient still last casual fuzzed band drastic showcased blue repertoire sound listener overlook side volume discard opinion rhythms represent overall band's classic ranging lay trademark instead previous exceed though zeppelin's comparison book-ended respect heavy well zeppelin always base backwards renowned skeptical personal following

My husband feels the same way and we've both discussed why this is. The answer is the music. It actually pulls us both along through the movie. Just as one great song ends, another begins, and we can't pull ourselves away until the movie - and thus the music - ends. There actually isn't a tedious, boring, or even mediocre piece in the whole musical. Every song has a style different from all of the others and each is quite powerful. The music is not the meat on the bones in this movie version of the Broadway musical, it is actually the very bones under the meat. My favorite is ""I'll Cover You"". Remarkably, this song works both as an upbeat love song for Angel and Collins and also as a funeral dirge. It is very amazing that Jonathan Larson, on his first outing, could come up with even one of these amazing songs, much less all of them.

If you are in my camp on this, let me  assure you that John Hiatt is the real thing.  This compilation is of  course a mere sampler of the work Hiatt has done but again they are songs  with sound and substance.  Hiatt writes your wonderful ballad about ache  and loss, those ridiculous decisions we make(Lipstick Sunset),and these are  certainly heart on the sleeve renderings of the human condition.  What puts  John Hiatt in a class by himself is probably what takes him away from the  amazingly popular gold record realm, and that is that he writes about love  gone right, not just love but marital love, with kids.  Hiatt puts down a  welcome mat to a world of babies, wives, former ghosts and abuses, and is  never afraid to expose himself on his journey flavored with folk, country,  blues, and stadium rock.  Finally, I would suggest if you have never  heard John Hiatt, pull up a chair and listen to the lyrics, full of  humor(rhyming ameoba and queen of sheba) and lovely images (the  aforementioned Lpstick Sunset).  A warning to you, these are songs that  appeal to the humanity in our journeys.

You're getting a lot of music for the money!  This collection reissues five titles never before available in digital format: Brahms' Symphony No. 4 (van Beinum), Lizst Organ Works (Chorzempa), Italian Opera Arias (Deutekom), Mozart's Oboe Concerto in C (Holliger), and Wieniawski & Szymanowski Violin Concertos (Szeryng). The anthology serves as a perfect companion to the 55-CD set ""Philips Original Jackets Collection: Obsessed With Sound."" Both boxes contain thick booklets with complete details and essays about the history of the label, and both feature similarly low prices.  Below is a full listing of the great performances and performers contained in ""The Stereo Years,"" arranged by composer. The many soloists include Alfred Brendel, Claudio Arrau, Sviatoslav Richter, Gidon Kremer, Jos Carreras, Jessye Norman, and Dame Janet Evans; ensembles include I Musici, the Beaux Arts Trio, and Quartetto Italiano; and orchestras include Bernard Haitink's Concertgebouw Orchestra, Wolfgang Sawallisch's Wiener Symphoniker, Colin Davis' London Symphony Orchestra, Raymond Leppard's English Chamber Orchestra, and Sir Neville Marriner's Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.

965,166255,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000002I99,KaseyG,False,"For years I avoided this album and wanted to hate it because I refused to accept solo Alice and harbored great resentment because he parted ways with the original band. I couldn't stay mad at Alice forever though and once I gave this album a chance I found the songwriting and production are so good it makes you forget that Michael, Dennis, Glenn and Neal are no longer there. The songs are catchy and well-written and many have that horror-vibe that made songs like ""Dwight Frye"", ""Dead Babies"" and ""I Love the Dead"" so memorable.  A great opener, ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" is basically setting the stage for the album just as ""Hello, Hooray"" had done for ""Billion Dollar Babies"". With Alice's vocals very much at the forefront of the mix, horns in the middle section, this is comically macabe though not as menacing as the Alice of 1971.  ""Devil's Food"" has a great ripple effect on the guitar, and is harder-edged like the Alice of old. The production on this song is excellent. Who better to guest-star on an Alice Cooper album than Vincent Price, who delivers a monologue in the middle section. When two masters of the macabre collaborate, how the results be anything but amazing? Price's spoken passage leads right into ""The Black Widow"", whereupon Alice himself picks up the narration. With basic but infectious guitar work, the song is irressistible. In parts, it sounds like Neal Smith himself on drums.  ""Some Folks"" is more Broadway-style that would have fit right in on ""School's Out"". It's not one of my favorites, but I never feel the need to skip over it either.  ""Only Women Bleed"" was a huge hit single in 1975 (#1 in Canada) and a surprising change-of-pace for those who only thought of Alice as the King of Shock Rock. Of course its title caused somewhat of a stir for obvious reasons (with lyrics like ""Man got his woman to take his seed"") and was shortened to ""Only Women"". I love the middle section that gets bolder before softening again for the finale.  ""Department of Youth"" starts off reminding me of ""Unfinished Sweet"" or ""Raped n Freezin"", and has good background vocals featuring a kids chorus as well as those terrific tribal drums.  Alice continues his obsession with necrophilia on the rocking ""Cold Ethyl"", a concert staple to this day, though not one of my favorites.  Alice sounds like he's singing from a rocking chair in the attic on the creepy, harpsichord-heavy ""Years Ago"", which leads into the Halloween-like piano intro of ""Steven"", another show-tune number.  ""The Awakening"" quiets things down before ""Escape"" starts things rocking again. The bells are unique and I'd rarely use the term ""charming"" to describe an Alice song, but this one is despite the fact it doesn't really fit in with the whole ""nightmare"" concept, unless it's meant to signify his waking.  Make sure you get the remastered version with the three bonus tracks:  The alternate extended version of ""Devil's Food"" has more echo on it but seems clearer and is better because the album version was mostly Vincent Price's monologue. This one doesn't feature Price but has an extended creepy instrumental section like ""Dwight Frye"". Probably my favorite song of the album.  The alternate version of ""Cold Ethyl"" is also clearer than the album version.  The alternate version of ""The Awakening"" is most interesting, creepier with Alice's whispers and a demented music box, plus the reappearance of Vincent Price. Also much better than the album version.  Alice's debut solo album is still his best work post-ACG and remains a great listen 35+ years later and the 2011 follow-up ""Welcome 2 My Nightmare"" doesn't even come close.",5,"09 21, 2011",The Original and Still The Best Solo Album from Alice,1316563200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,whereupon term cold speak start part steven bleed price's change-of-pace passage get favorite many reason sure later song harder-edged finale stage really seed despite signify original right reappearance obsession monologue cooper charm youth shock whisper well-written creepy irressistible continue version would master stir track necrophilia ago quiet welcome hit band lead shorten forefront songwriting either plus extended forget two baby mean opener resentment stay do refuse lyric black staple much devil's think rock dwight like vocal woman way alice section wake come concept ripple demented listen title follow-up macabre alternate nightmare unique unfinished well obvious intro one love make whole bonus hooray forever sweet horror-vibe effect bolder hate accept freezin also still solo show-tune year memorable catchy smith old though creepier basic three he's comically narration give harpsichord-heavy guest-star collaborate feature frye use work longer glenn skip piano song need billion canada folk i'd dennis seem take michael want rarely middle find rock box interesting music huge thing debut course dead ethyl tribal reminding favorite hello good setting single awaken fit mad neal get terrific harbor mostly background part close rap man escape kid make best widow macabe concert department halloween-like bell well alice's another get post-acg remastered unless broadway-style drum school's infectious attic woman chance chair somewhat remain feature result delivers cause echo great amazing feel surprising food fact clearer sound sing probably price number album pick vincent instrumental production even horn day basically mix guitar avoid never menace soften describe chorus excellent make dollar king anything

974,236454,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000002QZI,Alfred Johnson,False,"Jesse Colin Young  If I were to ask someone, in the year 2008, to name a male folk singer from the 1960's I would assume that if I were to get an answer to that question that the name would be Bob Dylan. And that would be a good and appropriate choice. One can endlessly dispute whether or not Dylan was (or wanted to be) the voice of the Generation of '68 but in terms of longevity and productivity he fits the bill as a known quality. However, there were a slew of other male folk singers who tried to find their niche in the folk milieu and who, like Dylan, today continue to produce work and to perform. The artist under review Jesse Colin Young is one such singer/songwriter.  The following is a question that I have been posing in reviewing the work of a number of male folk singers from the 1960's and it is certainly an appropriate question to ask of Jesse as well. I do not know if Jesse Colin Young, like his contemporary Bob Dylan whom he followed in moving from acoustic folk to folk rock, started out wanting to be the king of the hill among male folk singers but he certainly had some things going for him. A fair to middling acoustic guitar but a very interesting and mournful voice in the early acoustic days.  Moreover, Jesse set himself, more than others of the time, to speak to urban concerns and longings. I can remember being mesmerized by the effect of Four In The Morning (usually listening to it at that time, as well). Or the longing behind Suzanne and Black Eyed Susan. Or the late night whiff of whiskey in the air (Yes, I know we were underage at the time but let us let that pass) with the forgetfulness of Rye Whiskey. Yes, there were some tools and talent there.

981,204746,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B000002KOO,Mr. Mambo,True,"This album is in my all-time top ten. Vintage Mac, flying at its highest. With this recording, they moved away from the somewhat confining and very derivative straight blues vein, and into some very new and adventurous territory. Peter Green--Peter the Great--demonstrated that he was ready to expand his horizons, and we are lucky for it. Absolutely magnificent singing and songwriting by Pete and Danny Kirwan, and superbly creative and powerful rhythm, as usual, from Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. And the guitar playing? Words cannot do it justice. Green confirms his reputation as one of the most expressive, tasteful, and technically great players of all time. I'm the same age as Peter Green, and I bought this LP when it first came out back in the late sixties. I loved it then, and I love it now. The tunes all hold up extremely well. The full-length version of Oh Well is a song for the ages, a masterpiece of the highest order.  The photo of the band gives me a wistful, bittersweet feeling. On the original LP of course, the photo was reproduced inside the cover at full size, and so you could see more detail. I think I once did a drawing of that photo, mainly because I was so enamored of the music and the band. We were all in our late teens or early twenties, so young, so fit, so strong, full of possibilities, and it was a different world. The guys in the group looked happy and carefree, oblivious to what was to come. I hate drugs, and what they did to Peter Green, how they ravaged him mentally and physically, and robbed him of the stupendous skills he once possessed, which were never higher than on this record. But then again, Peter is still with us, still playing, still touring, and so, even though he is a shadow of what he once was, we can be thankful, and raise a glass to him.

985,138808,A3KGYTO6CF8MGF,B000002G18,Clarissa,False,"This, much like La Luna, is a concept album. But instead of the moon it's the sea. She talks about being friends with a whale and even touches on animal cruelty. But worry not if this sounds absurd. Sarah can do and sing just about anything and still make it beautiful and chilling... There's sadly no operatic pieces here, as it's a departure into pop, just as Fly was to rock, but instead of today's bubblegum pop it leans moreso towards light dance, ethereal, and even some new age. It opens up with whale sounds in the background as Sarah reads from the book ""Whale Nation"" by Heathcote Williams on the intro to ""Dive"" which glides into one of my favorite tracks here, ""Captain Nemo"" with her voice in the ending chorus erupting powerfully thanks inpart to the help of The London Community Gospel Choir. Then comes The Second Element. There's actually two versions of this song with different lyrics, but The Second Element II has more of an acoustic sound. They're both wonderful, though... I really don't understand why everyone seems to think that ""A Salty Dog"" is tiresomely simple and corny. It's probably one of the deepest and most emotional songs on here; the feeling just building as it progresses... Other favorites include her Kate Bush impression on Johnny Wanna Live, the sexy dance tune ""Once In A Lifetime"", the new agey ""Island"", the stormy dance track, ""When It Rains In America"", ""By Now"" (which my absolute favorite!), and ""La Mer"" with the panting backdrop of Enigma's Sadness and her spoken somewhat breathy words on the verses, such as: ancient unknown mammals, on a stormy sea, like Buddha in the water, a velvet energy... I recommend this album full-heartidly. Next to La Luna this is my favorite CD by her. But be warned. It takes several listen to really appreciate, just because it's so different. P.S. - I've seen some wild pictures by Sarah Brightman before but nothing prepared me for this.

990,484686,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B0000649OY,Brett Corkins,False,"12 Stones' debut, way back in 2002, is one of the masses that was forgotten in a sea of carbon-copy radio bands. Did they deserve to be looked over? Neh. But I'm not surprised they were since the only reason they found any amount of fame was because Paul McCoy sang with Amy Lee in the insanely overplayed Evanescence breakout smash Bring Me To Life. But, as time has shown, you cannot kill 12 Stones because they're still at it, putting out above average rock tunes.  As for the self-titled debut, this is easily their best to date. Yes, it has an all too familiar ring throughout the duration, but God help me, I have a huge soft spot for rock like this. Paul's voice is crisp and clear, the band puts some very catchy riffs to good use, and the lyrics, while religious, can be taken in any number of different ways (a plus). The big downside to this CD is that, by the final few songs, the lack of real variety runs thin and you find yourself wanting something more. Not to mention that most of the ridiculously good songs are lumped into the first half of the disc.  12 Stones isn't for everyone. They wear their religious background on thier sleeves, they really don't experiment with their sound at all, every song follows the same path as the one before it, and yes, Paul's vocal delivery can be frustrating at times. If you can look past all those pitfalls, then this CD is full of good hard rock fodder. Crash is an exceptional, powerful opener, The Way I Feel is more of a down trodden song, Fade Away has a pulse pounding chorus, I beg you not to sing along to the emotional In My Head, and even despite the uninventiveness of Soulfire, it's still a fun song to listen to.  All in all, given the period of time 12 Stones' debut came out, it's aged very well. It offers nothing new to the genre but it also doesn't try to be anything it isn't. While it would've been nice to have a bit more variety thrown into the mix, this is a nice trip down memory lane.

My friend got me into her music & this is the 1st Janet album that i've purchased.  My opinion of her singing still hasn't changed because there are so many more of the new divas that sing better than she does.  Besides that point made, there are a few songs that I like.  ""Damita Jo"" has a very nice dancefloor beat for a hip-hop club, but it could've used some different lyrics instead of just copying from Jennifer Lopez's ""Jenny From The Block"" by trying to insist that she's just like any 'ol neighborhood girl with fame and a lot of money.  ""Strawberry Bounce"" is a nice song.  My favorite part is really just the beginning of that song.  I love ""R&B Junkie"" because it revives the entire 1970s Motown sound.  ""My Baby"" featuring Kanye West is a favorite of mine only because of Kanye's rap.  Another female singer could replace Jackson on that song and can clearly make it sound better.  Her voice doesn't bring anything to that song at all in my opinion.  But my favorite tracks on the entire album have to be ""Thinkin 'Bout My Ex"" & ""Like You Don't Love Me"".  I personally think that those 2 songs should've been released as the 1st two singles, but seeing how long this album is (just as her past 4 albums), she can release a few more singles.  Since she's not particularly known for her cds and just for her videos & songs, those 2 tracks should've been released a long time ago.  I wouldn't exactly call Janet the best singer in the world.  Her voice is like a whisper and I don't classify that as singing but some of her songs are listenable.  Although Janet has longevity, the new millenium divas like Jessica Simpson, Beyonce, Alicia Keys, & Christina Aguilera clearly sing better than Janet Jackson ever has, and I would definitely recommend their music over Janet's anyday.  Her albums come out way to long and those stupid interludes could be cut, especially the ""Country"" interlude.  Also, some of the talkin during the songs can be cut out, like in the ending of ""Damita Jo"", she goes on to say, ""Ooh, I'm gon tell yo daddy, I'm gon tell yo mama"".  That seems to be very useless.

They were a popular London-based group when I was a teenager coming into adulthood and pop culture in London. The PSB have always been more popular outside of America; they still have a dedicated core of fans in America, but a much more extensive base of fans in Europe, Asia, and South America. Whenever they have a new album or collection come out, I get it, automatically. I don't regret having bought this CD, as, without it, the collection would be incomplete. But I think it is mistitled. Every track on this Essential album is already on another piece I have, and all are less popular remixes of some of their more popular song (unless it is an obscure remix of an obscure song, which makes the title Essential even less applicable). I must confess, I was disappointed. While it is a plus sometimes to have these tracks on one CD (for instance, when driving), it is nothing more than I might have made myself with a CD-R drive and little bit of time. I was a bit irritated, actually, to find that collection I'd purchased is in fact a compilation of tracks I already had, at an inflated price, made so by the fact that it was 'limited' (although, even given its 'limited' status, I notice each time I look that there are still copies available, and thus I ask myself -- limited to what?).

1003,218349,A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1,B000002LED,Erik Bateson,False,"""Like Appetite for Destruction, this is an album I want to enjoy far more than I actually do. Jane Says is a great song (the steel drum and the back and forth chord changes between G major and A majorlike Led Zeppelin did on 'Over the Hills and Far Away'really, really works), but overall this album has a kind of dated feel and the biggest problem here, I think, is that Perry Farrell's just not a very interesting lyricist or frontman. Many singers (Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Joanna Newsom, etc.) have done a lot with limited vocal abilities, but Farrell never seems to be able to transcend his technical imperfections. If his voice is weak, though, his lyrics may be worse. Take, for instance, Standing in the ShowerThinking, a dopey song about the deep thoughts a man has while urinating on himself in the shower. The premise is dumb; the execution is terrible:   I'm thinking about power The ways a man could use it Or be destroyed by it The water hits my neck And I'm pissing on myself   'Ted, Just Admit It' and 'Had a Dad' are pretty good, and I will revisit this album in due time. At the moment, though, I think it's only fine. It's not bad, but I just don't see it as a defining album of 1988 (which saw the release of It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back and Daydream Nation), let alone the 80s as a decade.""  ^ That was my original three-star review of this album. Listening to it again recently, I now see that my response was too harsh: this is a flawed album, but it's also an excellent one. Like Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti or My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, this is an album that has taken me some time to fully appreciate and while I don't think it's quite on the level of those efforts, its deserving of its classic and iconic status (unlike Appetite for Destruction). I still am not convinced that Farrell is able to mask his vocal limitations all that well, but ""Jane Says,"" ""Had a Dad,"" and ""Ted, Just Admit It"" are great, and while I think I was right that ""Standing in the Shower...Thinking"" is a weak track, it's the exception here, not the rule.",4,"05 24, 2015","A classic, revisited",1432425600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,review track newsom date lyric think power lyricist vocal limitation admit premise hit use quite decade enjoy joanna like thought stand hill shower way level could fine actually think rule hold destruction deserve chord cohen dumb perry many bad three-star due dad valentine's urinating seem take problem instance majorlike great drum flaw take steel feel song shower...thinking deep singer interesting imperfection unlike really technical one lot change back jane original showerthinking ability right daydream let far bob dopey kind able exception good bloody limit farrell loveless leonard terrible major define want effort lead alone listen neck ted fully time farrell's frontman album transcend revisit bad etc also response still mask weak works voice see nation iconic water convince physical forth recently release man big execution never say appreciate moment i'm status saw overall classic though destroyed dylan take excellent away'really zeppelin's piss harsh well zeppelin graffiti do may appetite pretty million

Like John Barry's score for Dances with Wolves, there is just something about this modern score that sounds so old fashion and yet we hear something new in it when we listen. This score has several layers. On one track you have quiet tones that are sad and reflective. Then there are the giant sweeping tracks that bring the feeling of danger and dread and of adventures about to be had. At times, these tracks are combined into on track that may start off with a huge sound of the old west, but then will end with the more quieter music. It is very well done, and I recommend it highly.

They are a band I heard of forever, been aware of forever that Carl Palmer was in this band before ELP (he only appeared on Rooster's debut album before jumping ship to ELP), and I even remembered a local Eugene, Oregon radio station (KRVM) playing ""Black Snake"" and ""Head in the Sky"" back in 1994 on a prog rock-oriented program called Deep Water Melodies.  OK, so In Hearing Of was their third album with just as many lineup changes. Now the band included vocalist ex-Cactus vocalist Pete French alongside guitarist John Cann, organist Vincent Crane, and drummer Paul Hammond. Many people call Death Walks Behind You as their high point, and while I have yet to try that album if In Hearing Of is anything to go by, I'm going to be in for a real treat for that album.  Anyway, this is a truly wonderful combination of hard rock and prog, certain to please fans of both, as the opening cut ""Breakthrough"" demonstrates, with some great piano and organ work, and some nice bluesy vocals. ""Break the Ice"" features some truly guitar guitar riff from Cann himself, and more great organ work from Crane. ""Decision / Indecision"" is a piano-oriented ballad which is not typical for the album, but works fine. ""A Spoonful of Bromide Helps the Pulse Rate Go Down"" (luckily not a parody of ""A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down"" from Mary Poppins) is an instrumental piece and by far the most traditionally prog-oriented piece. ""Black Snake"" is a truly nice mellow number, dominated by Crane's organ work, while the band rocks once again with ""Head in the Sky"". ""The Rock"" is the album's other instrumental piece, with some Chicaco or Blood, Sweat & Tears-like horns (arranged by yours truly, Vincent Crane), imagine if those two bands sounded more like Atomic Rooster, this is what you get. The CD reissue also includes their hit single, ""Devil's Answer"", still an excellent song, even if includes Chicago or BS&T-like horns. Oddly, the American LP on Elektra has this on In Hearing Of, but not the British vinyl, so basically if you own the CD reissue with ""Devil's Answer"", you got the complete American LP. I guess Elektra wisely knew the American audience was not as likely to buy singles so that's why they tagged ""Devil's Answer"" to the end of side one of the LP (right after ""A Spoonful of Bromide"").  What's also interesting is the cover is by Roger Dean, perhaps one of his most down-to-earth covers, it bears so little resemblance to the Yes album covers he's best known for, but then Roger Dean had done covers that looked little like Yes album covers like Babe Ruth's First Base (1972) and Gracious' This Is...

1024,713299,A2JTZI7Y58X9W5,B000VEA38E,Istvan Regos,True,"I was so much looking forward to this brand new edition of the spectacular Star Wars music. I was picturing images that looked similar to the Lord of the Rings Complete recordings. But then my dissapointment was complete, when I got the item. The artwork is nice indeed, all of the 2 Disc-CDs covers have the original LP recordings coverarts, but the music has not been further remastered or enhanced non whatsoever. I begin to think, that the best available editions of John Williams's classic are the 1997 RCA Victor editions, which have been digitally remastered and brought to life chronologically, as they are in the films. Since then, the 2004 Sony Classical edition, and then the 2007 edition is the exact same music in the exact same sound quality, which could be better. Maybe the digital technology has it's limits too, and the original 77-80-83 master tapes cannot allow any more enhancing, but I don't think, that the Throne Room and End Title from A New Hope has to sound so scratchy as it does in all of the editions.

And yes, I am starting my review from that angle since the singer is tone for tone a very well formed copy of Jim James. I'm not knocking the singing because of it, but the ""originality"" tag I keep hearing about this band loses its shine because of the similarity. That and the abundant use of reverb, which is a staple of the MMJ sound.  Yes, this is more folk than country and that is where the MMJ comparison ends. The songs bring me back to growing up in the Appalachian foothills, which is refreshing to hear from a band stationed in the Pacific northwest. The songs are fairly masterful in creating a wonderfully haunting tone, but I believe I've heard this before . . . on an album called ""At Dawn."" It appears I can't get away from the MMJ comparison and while that may be a flaw in me personally, I still enjoy this album in spite of it, though I'm not inclined to sit my friends down to hear it. Well, except for ""White Winter Hymnal"" which haunts my dreams.  I really feel it is unfair to not mention MMJ when talking about this album.

1037,327656,A103KNDW8GN92L,B000007UCR,David Hugaert,True,"After departing from Genesis almost seven years earlier in 1970, Anthony Phillips released his first solo record, ""The Geese and the Ghost, in 1977, although Phillips wasn't the first member of the band to release a solo album (that honor goes to Steve Hackett, who beat Phillips to the punch, by releasing ""Voyage of the Acolyte"", in 1975). Upon the initial listening of ""TG&TG"", it would appear the lengthy ""sabbatical"" Phillips took would cause his musical skills to suffer from a case of ""rustitis"", but that's far from the truth. On the contrary, the lengthy absence helped him mature his craft, making ""Geese..."" perhaps one of the most underrated works in all of progressive rock. In practical hindsight, this is a work rich in progressive undertones, with classical influences dominating most of the selections. One listen to the title suites: ""The Geese and the Ghost, Parts 1 & 2"", will confirm this fact. Joining Phillips on this breathtaking journey, are Genesis mates Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, whose vocal performances on ""Which Way The Wind Blows?"" and on ""God If I Saw Her Now"" are among the best of his career. Speaking of another above-mentioned (ex)-Genesis member, Steve Hackett, whose brother John makes an important contribution to ""TG&TG"" on flute. Another breathtaking contribution worthy of mention, is Anthony Phillips' vocal performance on another of the few vocal tracks, that being the melancholic ""Collections"", including the bonus track that closes the CD, the acoustic-driven ""Master of Time (Demo Version)"". Including the Genesis and solo albums ""Wind & Wuthering"" and Mike Rutherford's 1980 release ""Smallcreep's Day"" (on which Phillips guests), ""The Geese and the Ghost"" is the last true progressive masterwork on which both Collins and Rutherford would have the pleasure of recording before they (along with Tony Banks) would take Genesis in a different musical direction, and not 100% for the better on future releases - 1978's ""...And Then There Were Three..."" notwithstanding. Since ""Geese..."" is such a lush and complex work of art, it may take a few listens to grasp all its eccentricities. Catch this ""Geese"" (or ""Goose"") soon, before it migrates south, permanently!

When I first got this CD, I listened to it on an Emerson stereo product. It sounded just fine...brilliant and lively, like Vivaldi should sound. Then I looked it up on Amazon to read the reviews...and about died laughing. Oh, boy. Sniffing?...you gotta be kidding. Okay, so I listened to it again, and still didn't notice any sniffing. So then I put it in the disc drive of my computer, plugged in my headphones, and turned it up as loud as I could stand it to be. You would need hearing like the Bionic Man to notice that the guy playing the violin is yes, indeedy breathing through his nose whilest he's playing. I could only hear it in the quietest passages, with the volume turned all the way up. Yes, possibly this was due to the microphone being placed a little too close to the violinist, but it doesn't ruin the recording. It's still very listenable and enjoyable.  While we're on the subject, here's a short list of people you can hear breathing on their recordings...Patsy Cline, bless her, when she inhales between lyrics of a song, she is absolutely right there in the room with you. Rosemary Clooney, in order to faciliate her incredible phrasing and singing talent, also was known to take a noticably deep breath before a loud note or an especially high one. Wayne Newton, in his classic soprano incarnation, often took a sharp whistling breath between lines of his songs, this was due to his childhood asthma but it sure didn't limit his volume or his pitch. Then there's Donovan Leitch who breathes and sighs all over the place...it adds to the atmospheric effect of his vocal style.  I'm sure that poor Gil Shaham didn't sniff on purpose, but it's probably very hard to breathe with one's mouth open while they've got a violin shoved under their chin.

What especially distinguishes this performance above all others is the steady pulse and the waltz swing/sway from start to finish. Thus, unlike in any other recording, this opera is fully engaging throughout. Bohm conducts with vivacious grace. All of the soloists are superb, and the Dresden Staatskapelle (an orchestra which Strauss and Bohm both loved) plays like a slightly brighter-sounding version of the Vienna Philharmonic.  There's nothing of the sentimentality of Solti's conducting, and little of the dark character of the Karajan-Vienna or of the Krauss-Munich performances. Bohm's great advantage over the Karajan-Philharmonia is a steadier tempo, and a more Viennese lilt.  Strauss's favorite conductors of his music were Bohm and Krauss; and I think that this Bohm recording would be the one that he would listen to the most-often.

I even had to listen again to my krautrock collection for a while. And after I was done I sat down to listen again to ""Isness"". What a great, modern, progressive rock album. What a great departure from what these guys have been doing in the past. The experimentation is there, the concept album is short of there, the long tracks, all the ingredients are there. And to make a long story short, I absolutely love this album. As I loved everything FSOL has released before. It is great music. I have been missing the kind of albums that is evident that their creators have spent long hours in the studio, thinking, ruminating, living, getting inspired, absorbing the drama of life and struggling to put it all together in an album that at the end they are proud of. I am so sick of this cut and paste music that is all around us today.

This  recording is one of my favourites along with ""Deer Head Inn""  (where Motian is the drummer).  I guess this critique is a form of feedback  to Jack to tone it down. This is not to say that he does not compliment the  trio, he does, but I find his playing a little ""one size fits  all"", when it fits (Live at the Blue Note and here) its brilliant, but  other times you would want him to play a little more melodic.

I prayed the Lord that at least the beautiful 'Eleanor Rigby' would be the original recording and thanks Heaven it was. Only a few other songs (there are 20 songs) like 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' are also the original recording.  You get the feeling that this CD is a mere potpourri of Beatles songs. The only positive thing is that the remix is very well done in so far that you have the feeling to stand between The Beatles while they are singing. So far for the quality of this recording. The philosophy of the producers (George Martin and Giles Martin.) seems to be that The Beatles are a symbol for the psychedelic late 60's and early 70's and they seem to ignore the fact that The Beatles had their greatest successes in the mid 60's like for instance the above mentioned 'I Want To Hold Your Hand.'

1069,865674,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B004SC8XEQ,Kaya Savas,True,"Marvel has had a shaky record when it comes to scores for their films, and when I say Marvel I mean Marvel Studios (which excludes Spider-Man and X-Men). Iron Man started off with a bang. They couldn't get Hans Zimmer but they got Ramin Djawadi to deliver an amazing score with a strong central theme. It strived in its simplicity and gave Tony Stark his rock star identity. Then with The Incredible Hulk Craig Armstrong while delivering a decent score didn't end up making a memorable stamp. The film didn't either. Then came Iron Man 2, and what does Marvel do? They toss out Ramin Djawadi and go with Jon Favreau's regular John Debney. While I respect Debney his score failed. At times it mimicked Djawadi, but Tony Stark lost his identity and lost everything that made the musical stamp memorable. So, with Kenneth Branagh on board for Thor he was able to bring Patrick Doyle to the project; his long time composer. Some may have questioned Doyle's ability to provide a thunderous score that needed to match Thor's thunderous personality. Thankfully Doyle rose to the occasion and delivered what is Marvel's best score to date. He also did something that till now only Djawadi did for a Marvel character and that was give him an identity.  There are two central themes at play here; what I call the 'heroic' theme and the 'danger' theme. One is a sweeping and emotional theme that represents Thor and the other a percussive action styling that makes up the basis of all the action tracks, or whenever danger is present. The soundscape works off of these two sounds and Doyle will usually clash the two to create momentous cues that not only are intense but emotionally gripping. A lot of this comes towards the end though. The beginning of the album is more dedicated to setting up the characters, setting and story. Now you may say ""well that's obvious."" But honestly I have listened to many scores that seem to forget that they too need to set up character, setting and story. Gladly Doyle's experience does not let that slip by him. Now that the score is firmly grounded he can create all the variations he wants and it will still feel like a growing continuation of where the journey started. Our first battle cue is ""Frost Giant Battle"" which has a slightly different feel than say ""The Compound"", and I love that you can differentiate that these two action scenes take place in different locations solely by the music. In the early cues that percussive intensity completely washes out the heroism factor for just a moment and we forget our main character is a God. As the album concludes the hero theme comes back into play and grows and grows. The full meshing of the percussive action with the sweeping heroism comes with ""Thor Kills The Destroyer"" and now we have our hero back.  The score is perfectly structured which really allowed me to get completely taken away by it. Patrick Doyle's themes are grand without ever being over the top and the simplicity in the melodies allows the music to reach amazing heights. I think Patrick Doyle has just proven himself to be quite a formidable talent in the realm of blockbuster score composers. The fact that the music is a symphonic score really gives it an organic weight that we don't hear too often. While I absolutely love synths and electronics in scores one can't deny that everyone is using them nowadays. It's really refreshing to have a big score such as this that doesn't rely solely on synths for an intense sound. Patrick Doyle's score pounds with thunderous success as he breaths life into Thor and gives us what is sure to be one of the most memorable scores of the year.",5,"09 19, 2011",Patrick Doyle Wows The Summer Crowds With Not Only A Great Summer Score But One Of The Best Of The Year,1316390400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},14.0,,star debney simplicity come theme ever project factor thunderous location time get tony many sure make till different ability date firmly electronics really doyle jon success stark marvel's let thor's symphonic organic theme structure hear composer everything track gladly rely zimmer rise work giant sound experience main han either film djawadi forget basis two set mean without board destroyer soundscape go year may composers spider-man mimicked give x-men wash away score rock character personality like continuation start character usually momentous everyone can't studio deliver musical pound long refreshing central slip obvious one love danger make give perfectly grip style first weight stamp time call top identity also heights decent match still memorable listen incredible armstrong reach heroism moment melody exclude mesh intensity story though emotional allows respect toss use film give synths concludes kenneth emotionally ramin intense john need hero grow differentiate think create grow want shaky whenever journey frost take big slightly doyle's bang music scene sweep formidable god lot back place regular able setting allow occasion come honestly early ground get clash present deny provide question talent score man hulk begin best often life compound deliver craig well say strong quite favreau's cue blockbuster realm represent completely action towards nowadays heroic something take amazing feel iron branagh record solely that's variation fact play need sound lose full strive kill fail album thor patrick proven dedicate battle deliver percussive marvel bring grand breath seem end make thankfully absolutely cue

1073,403883,A22KWPKD3IH391,B00004S5WO,The Aeolian,True,"Don McLean had the great good fortune and the nagging misfortune of having a thumping big hit early in his career.  Having one of his songs become a cultural phenomenon guaranteed him sellout concerts as it hung a big medallion around his neck that read ""American Pie Guy"".  McLean had more to offer than that epic pop music history  clef.  This handy compilation offers a listener a taste of McLean's more substantial work sprinkled among the obligatory love songs and covers.  Before American Pie made him famous, McLean wrote biting social commentary in songs such as Respectable.  His first single after American Pie -- Vincent -- showed him as moodily reflective.  Following that, Dreidel had a deceptively upbeat pop arrangement which made the lyrics seem more bland than they are:  No days you can borrow, no time you can buy. No trust in tomorrow. It's a lie. And I feel like I'm dippin' and divin'. My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels. I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin'. But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels. My world is a constant confusion. My mind is prepared to attack. My past a persuasive illusion. I'm watchin' the future it's black.  This is not Don't Worry, Be Happy time, but those are feelings most of us can identify with.  Another contrasting treatment is Wonderful Baby, which seems like an amusing cutesy-cuddly whimsy, until you listen:  Wonderful baby nothin' but new, the world has gone crazy, I'm glad I'm not you. At the beginning or is it the end? It goes in and comes out and starts over again.  Get that ""I'm glad I'm not you.""  Not even Bob Dylan could make a pop music career out of trenchant observations, so McLean served up his share of musings on romance, but even there things weren't always perky, as Castles in the Air ended up with Empty Chairs.  McLean had to do a cover of a song by his boyhood idol Buddy Holly (Everyday) to inject an optimistic note.  When he turned out isn't-love-a-delight efforts (La La I Love You, And I Love You So, If We Try, Going for the Gold) he sounded like John Denver at too high an altitude, or Gordon Lightfoot in one of his wince - inducing sensitive modes, and those are the weakest songs here.  As McLean released songs about the problematic prospects of life, his pop music chart performance kept drifting down, but he found a niche on Adult Contemporary playlists.  His albums performed similarly; by the early 80s, he was seen as a relic of the decade that started with Crosby, Stills and Nash and ended with disco, which tells us something about changes in popular taste.  McLean's last album to crack the Billboard Top 40, released as the 70s wound down, had less bite than his early efforts: there were four covers of conventional material, one of which, a gorgeous version of the Roy Orbison/Joe Melson song Crying, gave him his last Top Ten hit, almost ten years after American Pie.  And so he drifted into cult status.  There isn't any indication that the tracks on this release were remastered for this collection.  The sound is fine -- full and clear.  The order of the tracks on this compilation pays no attention to chronological order, and the booklet notes don't lay this out clearly, which gives this album a sense of being an organic work, rather than a compilation.  This not a bad idea, but it waves away the reality that an artist's works reflect the artist's interests and skills at various times in life.  (Imagine a Bob Dylan hits collection with Gotta Serve Somebody as the next track after Like a Rolling Stone.  Yep, that's two Dylan references.)

In addition, I shouldn't slight the other singers and chorus in the performance, especially Nicolai Ghiaurov, who are terrific.  Richard Bonynge's conducting of the London Symphony Orchestra is impeccable and everyone involved lets things rip.  The only drawback to the recording is the ridiculous price that some vendors are charging.

1076,354626,AO7SIUA0LHKGN,B00000FCD4,eurocrank,True,"To me, the first three Starcastle albums ('Starcastle,' 'Fountains of Light,' 'Citadel') are interchangeable and equally problematic. Throw a castle in the air, where it falls you pretty much know where . . . but they don't. Gravity is not their forte.  While the musicians are very capable, especially the bassist and the main guitarist, the lead singer's voice is, in my opinion, perhaps the most annoying on record. Vapid, without edge, depth, or resonance, it represents the major flaw of the band. Unlike any Yes album, every Starcastle album commits the one unpardonable sin for a progressive rock band: no drama. Compared to Terry Luttrell, Jon Anderson sounds like Lemmy.  The music has lots of texture, but no weight. It is filigree that turns fuzzy on close inspection; light and shade without the sun and moon behind them.  Busy bees--where's the queen? Spiders spinning--where are the flies? There's no earth in the Starcastle cosmos.  Try to imagine, if you can, a fantasy novel without a romantic plot or a heroic quest. The Starcastle knights and whatnots are engaged in a fashion show: ""What ho, my young squire, your flashing splendour brings me to my diaphanous knees. Such chartreuse! Why, my periwinkle does but blime the air around its deciduous charm. I crave your sartorial charity.""  Yes, ELP, Kansas, Genesis, King Crimson, Camel, Gentle Giant, UK, PFM, etc. wouldn't be caught dead playing this stuff.  But I do play Starcastle from time to time--because of its textures, its lack of drama. To me, Starcastle is the first New Age prog-rock band, and I wonder how many of the many bands currently on the runway (cf.

And why wasn't ""Eighteen"" or ""School's Out"" used in place of Alice Cooper's ""No More Mr. Nice Guy""?

LUCKY ONE is an album in the true concept of the traditional albums back in the day when 'records' were vinyl. There is a symmetry to the composition of the songs and the big band style on many of the offerings is music like many young fans have not heard before. The title song, Lucky One, is one of those songs you won't be able to get out of your head (in a nice way!!) and Moonlight Kiss is a swinging, smashing arrangement reminiscent of the old 1940's musicals/Copacabana type numbers. Even the sadder songs have a hopeful underpinning; Crying for You and One More Angel are sad and sweet simultaneously; Hello Again is an uptempo dig at the return of heartbreak; Ready for My Loving is a slightly suggestive, marvelous song, and So Beautiful an uplifting ballad which might well start showing up at weddings.  Malo's guitar playing is exceptional, as always; indeed the entire band is absolutely first rate. The brass, the bass, the horns, the keyboard, the percussion...All-in-all, what a real band used to sound like! The background vocals by the band are perfect--take a listen to Moonlight Kiss, in particular!  OK--I'd said nothing about the vocals. What's to say???? Raul Malo is undoubtedly one of the preeminent singers/vocalists of not only our time, but of all time. A man who could sing a menu and make it unforgettable. Who can sing a song in any style. A man whose vocal range is magnificent. A voice of such exceptional clarity and purity that reviewers run out of descriptive adjectives for his singing.  It must be hard always being compared to Roy Orbison, the other ultimate vocalist of all time, but Raul has to be used to that! Add to that an amazing versatility as a songwriter and musician, as well as judge of talent. Mavericks fans will be pleased as well. The style is reminiscent of the Mavericks in their prime and Raul was the force behind that legendary country/rock crossover band. It's hard to pigeon-hole an artist such as Raul Malo. Lucky One is a composite body of work of which Raul should be quite justifiably proud. Raul's best work yet.

However, just this Christmas day, I was with family, and the household happened to have a superb DVD/Dolby surround setup and the man of the house received the DVD-A of 'Hotel California' as a gift.  He put it on, and I was there to experience this already time-honored album in glorious multi-channel surround sound.  If you thought you've heard enough of the Eagles' best album, you ought to give this a chance -- the classic title track alone makes it worth the purchase.  You will hear cymbal swells, guitar parts separated and panned, vocals and all that is the musical brilliance of this album as you never have before.  ""Wasted Time"" sounds so good it will make you weep (this was always one of my favorite Eagles album tracks, as is ""The Last Resort"", also benefitting from the DVD-A treatment) ... highly recommended for Eagles, classic rock, and music fans in general needing to hear how good either the DVD-A or SACD format can be.",5,"12 26, 2004",DVD-A of 'Hotel California' worth getting,1104019200,{'Format:': ' DVD Audio'},87.0,,glorious give pan track house multi-channel pop chance radio waste thought rock brilliance need california treatment vocal however hear cymbal might swell time title last eagle sick favorite dark many earshot within enough pink happen floyd's mac's rumour dvd-a recommend today already till musical possibly dvd/dolby fan music put resort one format separate setup time-honored sound good sacd worth fleetwood lead hotel alone time highly purchase album part gift hear familiar track general also even surround receive day guitar man listen sound side make moon experience weep either ought christmas never superb around since best classic benefitting make zeppelin always late family household
1095,1166566,A1BPFV0N4C12AI,B00000584Z,Eugene Axe,True,"This compilation of rare and unreleased Carcass tracks is definitely worth the purchase if you are a fan of the band.  The disc begins with 5 songs from the Swansong era, of which 'Emotional Flatline' is the standout song.  The others are OK, but nondescript.  Then there are 4 BBC Radio One session songs.  Of these 4, the version of 'Buried Dreams' and 'Rot 'N' Roll' stand out.  These 4 BBC tracks are followed by the excellent 'This is Your Life' from the Heartwork album and one of my personal favorite Carcass tunes, 'Rot 'N' Roll'.  'Rot 'N' Roll' has fast, excellent riffs, good drumming, is catchy, and contains some of Jeff Walker's tightest vocals.  Love that song; C'mon, Rrrrot!!!!!  After this, the music gets older, including 3 tracks from the Necroticism period.  Of these, 'Pyosisified' [try saying that 3 times fast] and 'Hepatic Tissue Fermentation II' are worth mention.  Then we continue back to the late-80's grindcore era.  Not my favorite period of Carcass' brief career, but the instrumental 'Genital Grinder II', with its distorted riffs, is a good song.  There is also a noisy, poorly produced version of 'Exhume to Consume' which should please the band's original fans that consider everything after ""Symphonies of Sickness"" to be a sell-out.  Overall, an interesting retrospective (in reverse chronological order) of Carcass' rarer material.  Highly recommended.

In fact, this is the release just before ""Lawyers in Love"" and soon thereafter, JB went into full scale political mode.  And no wonder.  Some of these songs are a little cheesey.  Especially the rhyming/rap in the middle of the ""Hold On, Hold Out"" song.  ""Of Missing Persons"" is a song about someone famous, I think maybe Elvis, but I can't be sure.  It's quite possible that some JB fan could elaborate more detail on this.  It's kinda sad and ballad-like, but the chorus is nice, albeit confusing (""And you can sing this song on July the 4th; In the sunny south and the frozen north"" - Frozen on the 4th of July?  This ain't Saskachewan).  There are only 7 songs on the album, and the first four (which make up side 1 of the vinyl version) are pretty great.  In fact, it was those songs that haunted my memory so much that I finally broke in and got this CD.  ""Disco Apocalypse"" has JB telling you that everyone can rise above on the dance floor, which, coming from him, sounds kind of cheesy, but the tune is great.  The title track, ""Hold Out"" has some great piano and keyboard in it.  ""That Girl Could Sing"" was slighted on his double greatest hits CD in favor of some of his political tunes, which is a shame, because it's probably the 2nd best song on this album, and was played quite regularly on the radio when it first came out.  I really like the guitar sound on this song.  It's unlike any other sound I've heard from a guitar.  Then there's the classic ""Boulevard,"" which was the only tune to make it to his double greatest hits CD.  This song is great rocking JB fare.  Overall, not that great of an album.

1100,287879,A3075RVSKC27HU,B000003S1A,P. Nicholas Keppler,False,"King Crimson blasted onto the music scene in 1969, jumpstarting progressive rock. The band lead a legion of rockers who were more interested in engaging in wild experimentation than bopping along in the three-minute pop song format and whose nights were more likely spent in the library than the juke joint. Crimson's leader, guitarist, Robert Fripp, however, grew tired of the movement that had branched from his band and disbanded King Crimson in 1974, exclaiming his disdain for the pomposity and indulgence in clichs that had infiltrated much of progressive rock. Seven years later, Mr. Fripp presented a new King Crimson line-up, including long-time drummer, Bill Bruford and commended session musicians, guitarist/vocalist, Adrian Belew, and bass-player, Tony Levin, with 1981's Discipline. The LP stayed true to Mr. Fripp's verdict about progrock, even dodging many of the formulas that Crimson, itself, had pioneered. The band was restarted from scratch. Gone is the influence of classical music; gone is the epic sense of enormity and gone are the cosmic themed lyrics. Instead, the 80s-era King Crimson was defined by a wavy, self-possessed arrangements, Talking Heads-ish funkrock and Mr. Belew's slyly neurotic rants. On tracks like ""Elephant Talk,"" ""Frame by Frame"" and the simply gorgeous ""Matte Kudiasi,"" Mr. Fripp and Mr. Belew engage in beautiful, subtle, fluid guitar-interplay. On ""Indiscipline"" and ""Thela Hun Ginjeet,"" Belew employs a theatrical, distraught, hair-ripping persona. Both songs are exceptional. Two of the most memorable moments in Crimson's recording history are the rickety game of call and answer between the swirling arrangemebts and Mr. Belew's yowls on ""Indiscipline"" and the hilarious spoken word section of  ""Thela Hun Ginjeet."" The album closes with two instrumentals, the imminent, easy-flowing ""The Sheltering Sky"" and the all-out groove of the title track.

1107,18630,A3DDSAGWD0UN9H,B000000TI8,Discophage,False,"For a long time, Mahler by Boulez was only a tantalizing and frustrating plea by esteemed French critic (in the French magazine Diapason) and Mahler biographer Henry-Louis de La Grange. Invariably, whenever a new recording came out, he'd finish his review, or so it seems, by a comment to the effect that, ""yes, it is a fine version, but ah, compared to Boulez whom I heard conduct it live with the BBC or the London Symphony Orchestra in 197 and something, it is nothing"".  So of course, one waited for Boulez to record Mahler like the Jews await the Messiah or the muslims awaited for Muhammad to receive the revelation. Needless to say, when it finally happened, with his cycle for DG, it was slightly disappointing. Some of it was great, some of it was plain, and some of it was even downright wrong-headed (I'll substantiate that in my review of Boulez' 7th, whenever I write it). Also, by then, much Mahlerian water had flown under the listeners' bridges, a whole new generation of Mahler conductors had emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s, Levine, Abbado, Inbal, Tennstedt, Bertini, Rattle, Sinopoli, Chailly, and the older generation was revisiting Mahler, with Bernstein in particular embarking upon his second cycle for DG. So what Boulez had to say wasn't as novel, original and indispensable is it may have seemed to de La Grange when he heard it live two or three decades before.  But that is making the bold assumption that Boulez in the 1990s performed Mahler as he had in the late 1960s and 1970s. In fact, on the evidence of this live concert with the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1968, it is striking the extent to which he didn't (note that the Hunt CD for which a customer has uploaded cover photos is another performance, from 1970).  So the concert is interesting for giving us a chance to hear Boulez' Mahler as Henry-Louis de La Grange might have heard it, and pined for it. The sound is acceptable given that it is an aircheck, the brass and the tutti are clear and present, but there is a kind of soft rattle around the string tone. There are various sonic and execution glitches, but the audience is remarkably inaudible, except at the end of the movements. Clearly this is not to be taken as anything competitive with the studio recordings of then and now. But as a documentation of Boulez's Mahler in the late 1960s, it'll do.  Interpretively, it is indeed, for its vintage, a very personal and original approach. Boulez' funeral march opens in a deliberate manner and with a burdened gait that had no precedent in the studio (although Scherchen had conducted it in concert in Philadelphia in 1964 in a very similar way,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Symphony-5/dp/B00005QAZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Symphony 5</a>). To give an idea, Boulez reaches the fast section in 5:53. Walter, in the 1947 premiere recording, had taken 4:41 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5/dp/B0013AYUC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>), and Bernstein, in New York in 1963, 5:09 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5/dp/B0000029XH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>). And it is not just a question of tempo, but also the tolling weight that Boulez invests in the regular marching rhythm. Interestingly, a year later, in 1969, Barbirolli made a famous studio recording (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5-Barbirolli/dp/B00000GCAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5 ~ Barbirolli</a>) that was very similar in its opening pace (5:50), and Bernstein, in his 1987 remake with the Vienna Philharmonic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5/dp/B000001G9F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>) went even further - e.g. slower: 6:15. On the other hand, when he finally made it in the studio, in 1996 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5/dp/B000001GYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>), almost thirty years later, Boulez reverted to a more ""normal"" pace (5:16).  But bringing off the first movement is not just a matter of choosing an opening tempo: it is also about the tempo relationship with the ""fast"" section, and whether one favors stong contrast or a sense of organic unity. There Boulez remains unique by adopting a very, almost excruciatingly even, slow tempo, slower even than Walter's, one that doesn't allow for very much of Mahler's ""leidenschaftlich"" (passionately) and ""wild"" (no translation needed) to unfold, but that is at least very consistent with his opening one. Still, Boulez establishes strong contrast, but through dynamics (it really erupts fortissimo) rather than speed, and the passage is certainly vehement, if not passionate. Returns the opening tempo, and Boulez' final section, at 11:00, starts beautifully, with ghostly strings, although the downside is that the more passionate surge that follows remains very pedestrian, and the great ""klagend"" climax at 12:27 misfires entirely: no impact, wrong balances, flutes and no brass.  The second movement displays the same strong interpretive personality. There, Boulez plays the maximum contrast of tempo, launching in not only with the ""gr&ouml;sster Vehemenz"" (greatest vehemence) asked by Mahler, but even with a fury verging on frenzy, with brass biting like enraged pitbulls. But then comes the slow section with its reminiscence of the first movement, and there, in keeping with his first movement tempi, Boulez adopts a very held-back pace. It is in fact Scherchen that he comes closest to here (in his 1953 studio recording for Westminster,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5-in-C-Sharp-Minor/dp/B000063DSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5 in C Sharp Minor</a>). In these slow passages, as in the first movement, Boulez dangerously treads the line between deliberate and sluggish - and determinedly crosses it at the ""pi&ugrave; mosso subito"" at 7:47. I guess you can call it ""pi&ugrave; mosso"" (literally: more moving), in view of what preceded it, but still, more ""mosso"" than very slow still doesn't make it ""mosso"". Here it sounds like one of those deliberately clumsy L&auml;ndlers so typical of Mahler. Well at least it is original, if not altogether convincing.  In all these choices of tempo, and especially his taste for the strong contrasts, one can question Boulez' sense of architecture and organic development, but nowhere more than when returns the theme of the first movement's fast section, at 9:47 (measure 392), where Boulez is now (because of his adoption of a very fast opening tempo of the second movement, of which this section is a continuation) MUCH faster than in the first movement.  In keeping with furious approach to the second movement, Boulez plays the Scherzo's wild fury and sardonic grimace rather than its playful charm, an approach that I like very much although many, including the esteemed Mahler critic on Musicweb-international Tony Duggan, might find cause to object. Duggan contends, with some justification, that the Scherzo shouldn't be the continuation of the second movement, but a bridge between the ""negative"" of the first part and the ""positive"" of the third part. Still, as convincing as Duggan's argument may seem intellectually, emotionally there is great thrill in Boulez' approach, and sometimes, in music, emotion must take precedence over intellect.  Although the effect is more furious with Boulez, it is interesting that, timing-wise, his Scherzo should be so close to Bruno Walter's (B 15:22, W 15:10) - and Walter is to this day the fastest Scherzo ever recorded, among more than 170 versions -  because, in the Adagietto again, it is to Walter that Boulez comes closest (B 7:35, W 7:42). This means that it is one of those very flowing versions, true to Mahler's original conception (according to his early champion Willem Mengelberg) of the Adagietto as a tender and passionate declaration of love to Alma and not the (equally beautiful) ""Death in Venice"" meditation on the passing of things that it became under later conductors, starting (in the studio) with Bernstein in 1963 (11:00) and continuing... with Boulez himself in his studio recording (10:56).  Like his second and third movements, Boulez' finale is all thrill and excitement. It starts like Walter's, which is brisk but not as brisk as Bernstein in 1963. But very soon Boulez whips it up to even higher voltage and hardly ever lets go, to the point that it sounds a bit too inflexible at times, with little concern for Mahler's ""grazioso"" passages. In the end Boulez tosses it off in 13:22 (to Bernstein's 13:43 and Walter's 14:08), which makes it one of the fastest finales ever recorded. The impression is of joy (""Allegro giocoso"" is Mahler's indication, together with ""frisch"", lively) almost verging at times on a kind of breathless urgency and even grim fury - the mischievous joy of a Till Eulenspiegel, maybe.  I don't know if this is what Henry-Louis de la Grange heard in the late 1960s or 1970s, but if it is I can understand - embellishments of memory helping - why he would have raved about it. Nobody had conducted Mahler's 5th like that before - and I doubt that anybody did since; Boulez certainly didn't thirty years later. About everything is disputable in this performance: Boulez' choice of tempi, his tempi relationship and his sense of architectural coherence. But one thing can't be disputed: it is a strong interpretive personality that is at play here, one for which I can see only Hermann Scherchen as a precedent (even Mitropoulos was more disciplined), in the readiness to sacrifice architectural coherence to the thrill, excitement and heat of the music. Boulez has the reputation of being a technically precise, ""intellectual"" but ""cold"" and ""emotionally detached"" conductor.

1118,1109596,APPV1ZDETO7B,B000001Y9T,Beatlenik,False,"Having only recently picked this album up, after years of feeling loss at the wonder of classic Yes, I was happy to find out that this was a ""real"" Yes album.  From Tormato to today, I could count on two fingers the Yes albums I liked (90125 and Union), three if I included Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe.  And even then it was with accepting warts on each album.  I thought Keys was more of the disjointed ""Yes"" which carried the name for the better part of two decades, something classic yes fans called Buggle Yes very often.  Even 90125 and Union were not REALLY Yes albums by our standards.  The Symphonic Music Of Yes album was interesting and I enjoy playing it from time to time, but one must bear in mind that it was Anderson Bruford and Howe phoning it in to Alan Parsons and The London Philharmonic.  Keys To Ascension, for me, is the last ""true"" Yes album in a huge discography which spans 1969 to 2015 and it came out in '96 with a follow-up in '97.  Rather than my usual of total impressionist review for the album as a whole, I would like to introduce the inquisitive prospective listener to a digest of the tracks and hope they find this useful:  Siberian Khatru:  The Yes collective for this outing (original classic line-up of Anderson Howe Squire Wakeman and Bruford-replacement unit White from Tales and Relayer etc.) redouble their effort on rocking this classic from Close To The Edge.  It easily equates to a faithful rendition with all of the energy and aplomb of the original with the exception that you immediately notice the missing Bruford from the performance, even though Bill was the first to tire of the majestic fusion inferno into which Yes was headed in the mid-70's.  White was a solid jazz-rock fusion choice and his work on Relayer especially was good.  But the Khatru demands a subtle difference.  The Revealing Science Of God:  We finally get to hear the great Tales piece in a  live setting and the result is a walloping performance worthy of The Yes Cult following.  It swells and flows with all the wondrous textures found in the original and is a pure delight for fans of the extremities into which Yes ventured before they fell down on Tormato and Drama.  America:  Glad to have it!  I had the original recording on Yesterdays vinyl which I sold off with the rest of the collection years ago when replacing records with CD.  Missing this song for years, this live performance actually sounds better than I remember it.  Wakeman and Howe really gather their forces making a unique cover of Paul Simon's classic.  Simon's lyrics never quite fit in with the Yes mystique which relegated the song to the Yesterdays collection, but after all these years one finds a more picturesque view and this live rendition brings a new appreciation for what was actually a classic Yes tune worthy of praise.  Onward:  one of just two songs I liked on Tormato (the other being the Squire bass-laden motif song On Silent Wings Of Freedom), Steve Howe's flamenco classical guitar introduction raises a good song to greatness.  If you don't have Tormato, you need nothing more than this.  Anderson delivers a passionate vocal equal to, if not more endearing than, the studio version.  Howe has always been a great axe man, but his adept fingers are genius when weaving classical, jazz, and rock together.  This piece is simply a work of art!  Awaken:  Rick Wakeman's pipe organ and synthesizer solo is gloriously extended and delicate, the beautiful mix of synth ""voices"" and church pipes reaches new pinnacles in this live version which is not as forceful as the studio original yet has a whole new texture of amazing beauty.  A wonderful accompaniment to the original for fans of the song.  Play them back to back in your phone or pod on nice buds and experience a new thrill.  Every fragile instrumental chime is perfection and Steve's guitar work slices new territory.  Anderson's voice is in nice form as well.  Roundabout:  The first thing you will notice is the acoustic guitar plucks sans reverb intro that marked the original.  In some sense this rendition is almost a jazzy laidback entry with pretty synth fingering from Wakeman.  The choral singing from Howe and Squire with Jon feel a little weak on the high notes but when they settle back comfortably into the background it RoundsOut better.  Yes still perform as a high and tight unit with perfection in their musical interchanges and there is nothing like a wart in their playing.  After so many years these guys are classic performers of the highest caliber.  Wakeman's almost Amazonian pipes secretly beckon to you in the quavering lull before he takes off on full flight after the midsection.  This is the way the song was meant to be heard live.  Simply fantastic.  Starship Trooper:  This entry from The Yes Album (1970) when Yes were converting from psychedelic folk to progressive classic rock has been a fan favorite ever since.  All of their concerts sport this classic and like professionals they deliver it with all the passion and energy it would garner on every outing, like a beloved child.  Howes guitar coda (Wrm) extends even longer here with an endless beauty that demonstrates why he is one of the best lead guitarists in the known universe.  This performance is the highlight of the entire album and I was never that big of a fan of the pre-Fragile music as I was of the classic era which followed this.  When Wakeman chimes in his accompaniment to Howe in the coda the glory just shines down from heaven.  Their interchange to the exit is a nirvana to behold.  Here is where most reviewers fall down with trepidation, the two long studio cuts.  I could be maudlin and try to compare them to ABWH or Union but that would be a severe untruth.  In fact they are much much better than anything on those efforts.  First of all we have all five members of the unit which brought us Tales From Topographic Oceans.  So here goes.  Be The One:  An almost 10 minute product of the ideals which propped up The Yes Album.  Andersons lyrics are straight forward without the stream of consciousness existentialism found in his 70s compositions, his vocals are well delivered and passionate.  Wakeman surrounds the song structure with warm arms while Howe distends his strings into high powered and then gentle improvisations.  White and Squire keep the rhythm with perfect timing and a few interspersed signatures.  Andersons vocals with harmonies by Chris and Steve are melodious and pleasing, and one must always keep in mind that Yes (as a positive affirmation) have always been explorers of the Light and Beauty.  Be The One is one of those great adventures is musical positivity.  Never underestimate the power.  That, That Is:  This, This is the true gem of the two.  Howes presence is immaculate and gorgeous.  He sets up the 20+ minute epic and holds it together throughout just as he did The Remembering on Tales.  But this just may be his grand opus.  Spanish guitar influenced beauty, this song can be considered a member of the classic Yes catalogue.  Andersons initial vocal workout and composition will remind any of the savvy people out there of Mike Oldfields Ommadawn and some of his 80s work (Jon worked with Mike on one album).  Once he navigates into the ballad section of the song his delivery with Steves complex fingering enter a Mahavishnu realm of time signature changes and then Wakeman sets up an ethereal sea for the group to dip into.  Whites drumming is terrific here as well, holding a bottom with Chris that seems unnatural sometimes, how do they do that?  Finally, wait for it, after 10 to a dozen minutes, Master Wakeman is coming  Wakeman pianos with harps, what more could one ask for?  Anderson queries How did Heaven begin?  Well, I think part of the answer is with beautiful music reaching out into the void like this does.  The finale of That, That Is, is simply Yes at the pinnacle of their power.  ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, one must remember that this is the same unit which brought us Yessongs, their triple album live set in 1973 (Bruford did play on a couple songs before leaving the group) and the audio quality differences (read technological advances) are superb.  There is some, perhaps valid, criticism that some of the live recordings contain studio overdubbing, but to my ears (the entertainment value is the significant factor) Keys is a brilliant album.  Alan White, often maligned unnecessarily, had vastly credible qualifications to replace Bruford.  After all, he was a member of John Lennons Plastic Ono Band and then was a member of George Harrisons All Things Must Pass studio and tour entourage, all before becoming a full member of Yes.  This is the best Yes album you can find after Going For The One and it imparts all the majesty and glory that could be found on Tales and Relayer.  If you are a Yes devotee or a new slave to their classic sound, don't pass it up like I did for so many years, it is worth the experience and I will be laying hands on Keys volume two shortly.",5,"07 1, 2016",The Best Yes Since 1977,1467331200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},2.0,,garner performer harmony power reviewer go gather chime wondrous tormato paul force inquisitive performance shortly notice ear come ever influence glad factor edge heard ommadawn worthy actually composition delight try subtle lay last tight get favorite many thing stream topographic make quaver triple note impressionist trepidation song wakeman happy extremity read finale abwh drama jazzy really decades bill warm malign jon heaven part bass-laden prop unnecessarily original audio psychedelic accompaniment savvy yes impart symphonic professional child highlight couple energy introduce almost version flight would hear flow track ago surround rendition demonstrate finally arm forceful band easily sound entourage experience shine volume extend lull presence superb slice steves set two endless axe mean alan without powered entry positivity oldfields onward call converting george every pleasing may explorers harrison praise string review feel count texture criticism phone lyric plastic advance much view effort appreciation think rock bruford-replacement record recording enjoy sea like positive sell vocal value adept delicate interchange signature section could freedom america product usual useful vastly pip fell interspersed finger group weave follow-up anderson nothing passion reach name roundabout wait unnatural today sans unique musical acoustic good genius long tour mystique enter hope loss consider replace intro one new change silent dozen whole reverb compare hold demand worth gorgeous yesterday first line-up anderson's remember time gloriously rhythm difference white etc cd still bear weak voice brilliant remind organ solo five bottom choral year settle progressive piano listener motif universe spanish head picked span albums choice ethereal play pas since secretly classic yet coda though take wing introduction ask always three prospective consciousness lennon query rather pinnacle ballad record flamenco nice tune vocal amazonian philharmonic disjoint work brought longer become midsection raise territory true comfortably starship drum credible john song simply know need swell underestimate think carry unit concert qualification member voice seem greatness big wonder leave redouble phone initial hand structure must fan accept devotee laidback find rock steve's music interest huge howe roundsout little fragile thing wart god set folk like entire back quality london high sense beautiful ideal slave good caliber set inferno synthesizer rick endear buds fit adventure guitarist relayer equal result improvisation mind immaculate perhaps terrific tire background entertainment white sometimes glory faithful exit close buggle tale chime standard trooper find form art recently oceans wrm dip man out void nirvana yessongs reveal classical piece equate cult gem ascension best often beauty wakeman's come harp throughout wonderful majesty deliver remember well picturesque time difference melodious discography catalogue mark fall simon's squire majestic perform member sport master technological existentialism collective find quite complex way ono steve valid immediately science fusion venture straight significant realm guy untruth perfect composition passionate interchange wart pluck delivers high extends something solid great amazing minute feel real begin relegate thrill wallop texture gentle beloved bring include fact play miss replace pure distends delivery awaken digest pod answer maudlin epic behold overdubbing live follow reach go exception sound sing work opus together collection workout minute light studio full effort khatru navigates beckon especially album pinnacle fantastic bruford hold synth church instrumental howe fan pre-fragile even aplomb severe rest lead affirmation mix howe's deliver guitar siberian jazz-rock forward mahavishnu contain vinyl anderson perfection never key cut grand mike finger pipe signature chris total union cover people jazz parson anything keep era pretty follow

Not just on a few songs either but either that or he just sounds corny! The title song is just stupid along these same lines.  50 Ways To Say Goodbye also sounds so dumb the way he sings it. He should have just sang the songs and forgot all that!  In fact the songs I like are the ones he just sang like Sing Together which is a little like Hey Soul Sister (but slower, a ballad).  This one could be a hit!  I also like We Were Made For This, another nice ballad that builds up to a rocking guitar solo and than slows again at the end with some Scottish pipes thrown in for good measure!

1138,2316,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,6303422748,Todd7,False,"It's unfortunate that Cross Purposes (1994) was released when it was (after Dio's departure), thereby reverting us back to the Tony Martin style that became the norm starting with The Eternal Idol in 1987. Some people were elated when Dio rejoined the band to record Dehumanizer, but it turned out to be a disruption of continuity, and Tony Iommi admits that he should have never disrupted things. Consequently, this album suffered from lack of sales due to a disenchanted Dio fan base who were expecting more releases from the Dio lineup, coupled with the Tony Martin fans who perhaps lost track of things when Dehumanizer was going on. Despite all of this, the album shines on many fronts. I think that Tony Martin was his best on this one, and Geezer Butler adds his signature doom and gloom bass to the songs. I particularly like the songs IMMACULATE DECEPTION, VIRTUAL DEATH, PSYCHOPHOBIA, and DYING FOR LOVE, which is a rare ballad from these guys. Virtual Death has really grown on me through the years. This is a balanced effort that rocks, and the subject matter is vintage Martin all the way. I WITNESS is the perfect starter, and is a great jam.

They are not exactly the same but similar. I enjoyed the video then and am sure it looks/sounds much better on DVD. I will buy it if I ever have the spare cash (I usually prefer opera audio only so I can visualize in a theater of the mind).  For awhile I wasn't into Levine's Wagner, mainly because of slow tempi. But I've recently revisited and reevaluated his work, deciding that the sheer beauty of his interpretation and the sound of the Met orchestra outweighs any test of my patience. If I get restless in the presence of such sublimity, the fault is surely mine.  I really don't understand the harsh complaints in some reviews. Every Ring has its quirks, but this one holds up well in comparison to the more acclaimed recordings. I am very familiar with Solti, Bohm and Janowski. I've also heard Sawallisch, Furtwangler and Krauss. Behrens does not have the power of Nilsson, but she sings a very beautiful and more feminine Brunhilde. So it's a matter of preference:  a more powerful or more vulnerable beauty. I also found little to complain about in the Siegfried of Goldberg. Again he's not the most powerful on record, but still valid and very enjoyable. All other principals are great without any reservations!  Levine can be slow but never drags in my opinion. The Met orchestra and recording quality sound BETTER than any of the above famous recordings. While those certainly deserve their legendary status, the Met is easiest on the ears and Levine allows the music to breathe when appropriate, whereas Solti and Bohm feel rushed at times.

1149,40650,AL2VDE4LO4ESR,B000001ESL,Jack Fitzgerald,False,"""Hemispheres"", released in 1978, was the follow-up to ""A Farewell to Kings"".  Rush again tackled a side-long theme with ""Hemispheres"", plus two short songs, ""Circumstances"" and ""The Trees"" plus their first extended instrumental ""La Villa Strangiato"".  Again we have top-notch musicianship and Neal Peart's lyrics focusing on balance, the old ""work hard, play hard"" adage.  I've always found Alex Lifeson's guitar sound kind of boxy and not my favorite performance of his.  Initially, I don't find side one of this record as accessible as ""Farewell to Kings"". 1.  Cygnus X-1, Book II.  Hemispheres.  We begin with the continuation from the last song on ""Farewell"".  The prelude introduces the major musical themes.  Plenty of stop-start rhythms and challenging time signatures, perhaps Rush's most challenging yet.  ""Apollo"" introduces us to the god of wisdom and music.  There are some nice dynamics but the melody never entirely wins me over.  ""Dionysus"" features the same verse structure.  Next is ""Armageddon"", the first part is heavy and bombastic, but the part where our intrepid astronaut is reintroduced ""some who did not fight..."" settles into a nice groove.  This brings another problem with this entire song, which is that at times it seems strained and tight, not loose like some of the jams on ""Farewell"".  ""Cygnus"" brings some atmospherics, best listened to on headphones, before wrapping it up with the conclusion that he will be the god of balance.  Last is the largely acoustic ""The Sphere"" which seems kind of tacked on and preachy.  3 stars. 2.  Circumstances.  This features a nice crunchy guitar hook from Alex, interesting chord changes, and a bit of lyrical cliche in French and English ""plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose"" but the song is a challenge to the listener to search.  The middle has a nicely orchestrated bells, keyboards and guitar part.  3+ stars 3.  The Trees:  A great Rush song.  The struggle for equality in a thinly veiled anti-communist lyric.  The beginning with the classical guitar part is excellent work by Lifeson.  Geddy Lee's intro vocals are nicely subdued and then there is a guitar/bass duet that blends quite nicely.  Again, another great middle part with percussion, keys and guitar but much a looser jam. than ""Hemispheres"".  5 stars. 4.  La Villa Strangiato:  A long (9:34) but very cool instrumental in which all three players get to shine.  The self-mocking subtitle is ""An exercise in Self-Indulgence"" and the various part titles bring about a smile, with examples such as ""A Lerxst in Wonderland"", ""Monsters!"", and ""The Waltz of the Shreves"", with Rush poking fun at pretentious art-rock bands and themselves.  That being said, there's some great stuff here, from Lifeson's blistering classical guitar intro, Geddy Lee's bass solo, and Peart's drum work throughout.

This album was to coincide with the cartoon movie of the same name. This album is actually a 4-star album, since only the first half of it is fixed with Beatles songs. The other half is fixed with George Martin compositions for the cartoon movie.  YELLOW SUBMARINE    This song originally came off of the REVOLVER album three years earlier. It was put here to stand as the cartoon movie's theme song. This is a great song.  ONLY A NORTHEN SONG    Not bad.  ALL TOGETHER NOW    My father hates this song because he thinks it a silly song. Yes, it is silly, but that's what I like about it. The cartoon was to supposed to be fun for kids, and The Beatles put this on here for the kids to laugh about and have a good time.  HEY BULLDOG    Now I definitely could do without this song.  IT'S ALL TOO MUCH    Great song.  ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE    This song originally came off of the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album and it is amazing. I love this song.  PEPPERLAND    Here's where the George Martin compositions begin.

EC certainly revitalized his career (on the pop charts, anyway) with '90s hits ""Tears In Heaven"" and ""Change The World""--both mellow but beautiful songs.  And for sure there are some quality tracks along that vein here--from ""My Father's Eyes"" to ""River Of Tears"" to the title track.  My favorite track is ""She's Gone"", the only track that comes close to being a bit uptempo.  The problem here is that the songs don't vary much at all and on average don't grab the listener.  And for sure, if you were looking for something along the lines of the classic ""Journeyman"" album, EC's last album of new material before this one (a good nine years earlier), you may very well be disappointed. To me, artists that have ""classic rock"" roots but later have a lot of pop songs only succeed with new material if they still include at least a few tracks that are true to their ""roots"".  That is why I liked the Billy Joel efforts from the mid '80s to early '90s but had little use for many of Elton John's efforts over that same period.  Clearly, EC shows none of his roots on this effort. If I was looking for a Babyface album (I do like the ""Tender Lover"" CD that my wife has) this would get 4 stars.

1161,1031502,A2D8R9EU2W7J6O,B00MRHANNI,Amazon Customer,False,"Taylor Swift wanted to experiment with a ""new"" sound and due to her birth year being in 1989, she figured why not play around with the 80's sound as well. Swift's album is completely different from anything else she's ever put out. While I'm a huge fan of her old albums (especially RED), I think this album is the typical wonderful artwork of Ms. Taylor Swift.  1 Welcome to New York: This song is a ditzy pop song with a fun electric beat. She says ""Welcome to New York"" about 100x. Comparing this song to Alicia Key's or Frank Sinatra's New York would put this song to shame, however. It's cute but not her best.  2. Blanks Space: The Swifties will LOVE this song. My favorite line is ""OMG look at that face, that looks like my next mistake!"".  3. Style: This is the song on the Target Commercial! I absolutely love this song. I love the beat, the James Dean reference. It's a very 80's sound that makes you want to take on the town with your heart shaped glasses and high waisted leather shorts (assuming you own a pair). It's one of my favorite tracks.  4. Out Of The Woods: A lot of people like this song, but I can't say the same for me. It runs the same problem as Welcome To New York where it fails to demonstrate Swift's writing ability. Just the same thing over and over again.  5. All You Had To Do Was Stay: This is Stay Stay Stay part 2!  6. Shake It Off: I still love this quirky song. This song is a instant mood booster. I've played it on my saddest days and absolutely it works! It's a lot of fun.  7. I Wish You Would: This song is an unfinished song that was played via a voice recorder. Cute idea!  8. Bad Blood: This song sounds great. It's another one of my favorites. It has this ""bad girl vibe"" to it. It's about a really bad break up that causes you to absolutely hate your ex. We've all been there right?  9. Wildest Dreams: This song reminds me of Lana Del Rey's ""Young & Beautiful"". It's a fast paced song speaking of remember the love in the best form. It's adorable,  10. How You Get the Girl: I can see why this song would be a favorite among the album, especially if you love her old albums. If you listen really closely, you can hear a guitar! Wow! It sounds like it was a unreleased song from RED.  11. This Love: One of the slower songs (not a bad thing!) I tend to like her slower songs but this one is a little forgettable. Maybe this one will grow on me.  12: I Know Places: Another skit. It's a really dark piano song that was sent to Ryan Tedder. It sounds amazing. I wish it were a full song.  13. Clean: A light pop song with a eccentric beat. It's okay.  BONUS TRACKS:  14: Wonderland: A salute to Alice In Wonderland, it's a fun song filled with how fast love can happen and how dangerous that is.  15. You R in Love: This song attempts to capture what love feels like. You can ""see it with the lights out"" it's always there. It's a cute song that Lena Dunham plans to use at her wedding (someday).  16. New Romance: ""Heartbreak is the national anthem"".

In the 1970s when I was a teen he had a show on and I remember seeing it every now and then.  His music is still with us, and every now and then his picture is too.  However, I'd never realized how talented he was until I got this DVD and watched it.  Bobby Darin had a gift, not just for music or acting or handling business affairs, but for winning over audiences he played in front of.  I watched as he won over the television audiences performance after performance, but he won me over too.  I love live music.  There's nothing like it.  But with Bobby Darin gone, this is as close as it gets.  What I saw in his performances was a man in love with what he was doing.  He shines with the zest he has for being in front of those people.  I didn't get the impression he was all that aware of the camera, but he knew those people were in the room.  At 37, Bobby Darin succumbed to a diseased heart he'd dealt with all his life.  He'd been told since he was a child that he'd have a short life, and he did.  But it would have been fascinating to see what he would have been like if he'd had more time.  Kevin Spacey, an ardent admirer of Darin's, helped put together a biopic of Bobby Darin's life.  The movie, BEYOND THE SEA, is on DVD now.  I wish SEEING IS BELIEVING would have had some interviews, but it's okay because now this DVD has made me curious enough to seek out Spacey's movie.

Fatal Smile is another all-around terrific band that hails from Sweden, and these guys like most others grew up idolizing bands like Poison, Warrant and Bon Jovi. I've said it before, and i'll say it again, Sweden is simply at the forefront of making the worlds best hard rock music these days.  While drawing on their love of the 80's pop metal scene, Fatal Smile ratchet up the heavier end of the rock spectrum. These guys essentially take the sound of Iron Maiden and Priest, and infuse that heaviness with Poison and Winger type melodies and radio friendliness. It actually works out quite well on this record too. All songs are terrrifc throughout the record, however, if I had a ""MINOR"" gripe it's that in the middle of the record the songs start to blend together a little bit. Nothing awful, just minor. The songs I liked the most from the record are ""Take It To The Limit,"" ""Raising Hell In Heaven,"" ""Nailed to the Wall"" and ""Innocent.""  This album is dang good the whole way through.

1174,114297,AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B0000028MA,Daniel Ferguson-Maltzman,False,"1992, what a year. The early `90s was an exciting time in rock. Now I'll admit to having a soft-spot for hair-metal, but the late 80s, early 90s was getting pretty lame, i.e. ""Cherry Pie."" Although there were some good bands in the days before Nirvana (some genuinely good, some guilty pleasures) the alternative/grunge movement of the early 90s was a refreshing change.  The soundtrack to the romantic comedy ""Singles"" is the perfect soundtrack and snapshot of that era. With the exception of Nirvana, almost every major Seattle/grunge band from the early 90s is represented, as well as some other alternative artists from that era.  Even if you own the complete works of the bands on this disc, this album is still worth buying because many of these songs are not on studio albums or on compilations.  You know how it is sometimes when a band puts a song on a soundtrack...the song often sounds like filler or a b-side that wasn't good enough to put on a proper studio album. Not so with the ""Singles"" soundtrack. Each song on this disc represents the artists' best work.  Alice In Chain's start off the album with ""Would,"" from their sophomore classic ""Dirt."" This alternative/metal classic is one of the album's heavier, darker songs. ""Would"" remains a radio staple and the blueprint that other mediocre bands copied from (that means you Godsmack). Pearl Jam contributes two songs to this album, the mid-tempo ""Breath"" and the harder-rocking ""State of Love and Trust."" They sound most similar to ""Vs."" era PJ. These songs remain two of the finest, if not finest, songs that Pearl Jam has ever recorded.  Chris Cornel (Soundgarden/Audioslave) contributes the soulful contemplative ""Seasons."" Paul Westerberg (Replacements, solo artist) contributions include the incredibly catchy ""Dyslexic Heart"" and ""Waiting for Somebody."" These are also easily two of the best songs Westerberg has recorded. The Lovemongers (aka Heart) contribute a cool rendition of Led Zeppelin's ""Battle of Evermore."" Mother Love Bone (the prelude to Pearl Jam) includes their morose classic ""Crown of Thorns."" Soundgarden's hard hitting ""Birth Ritual"" sounds as though it could have easily have been included on their ""Badmoterfinger"" (1991) album, and it is easily just as good as any other song from that album. The underappreciated Mudhoney include their fuzzy grunge classic ""Overblown."" The CD goes back in time a bit for Jimi Hendrix's classic ""May This Be Love."" The inclusion of a classic rock song on a grunge album does not break the pace as its tone/style compliments the other songs nicely. The Screaming Trees awesome ""Nearly Lost You"" (from the ""Sweet Oblivion"" album) and Chicago's Smashing Pumpkins ""Drown"" round-up the CD. Again, those are two of the best songs that either band has recorded.  Every song on this soundtrack is excellent. There is simply no filler. It's a perfect time-capsule of the early 90s and a terrific introduction to the Seattle/grunge sound of the early 90s. It's a modern rock classic and well worth owning.",5,"04 14, 2005",A perfect time capsule of the early 90s,1113436800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},58.0,,know sophomore dyslexic heavy contribute hard staple go admit i'll radio paul rock breath work artist break remain lame b-side jam nicely romantic like hendrix's i.e ever evermore mudhoney soundtrack pace alice dirt disc thorns song cherry could smash simply lovemongers represent tree perfect contributes fuzzy grunge pj pumpkins put pearl modern many enough prelude change buying underappreciated single somebody mean song state westerberg alternative/metal although refresh aka put nearly birth round-up guilty one include compliment movement seattle/grunge godsmack harder-rocking love wait back hair-metal replacement similar blueprint mother crown jimi oblivion sweet exception sound good badmoterfinger fine lose soulful worth day album's inclusion pleasure major trust bit drown studio almost soundtrack...the remain early cool band lead time time-capsule owning excite album would heart overblown terrific sometimes pie soundgarden's also cd bone season still rendition complete artist work proper even contemplative start darker battle band filler solo include easily chicago's soundgarden/audioslave sound contribution ritual soft-spot nirvana either snapshot album chain's genuinely catchy morose mid-tempo alternative/grunge best comedy compilation two incredibly often classic mediocre record represent scream awesome tone/style include though excellent zeppelin's introduction alternative well year copy hit get late every cornel may era pretty chris

Although Dave's contributions beyond vocals to most of DM's music has been marginal (through Martin Gore's insistance) Dave really shines here as a songwriter as much as he does as a vocalist. This is a collection of well written songs that will go the distance. Not many singers can pull that off with their solo albums.

1200,677294,AR7422C5X7MUR,B000JJRXG6,P.S.,False,"Since the early days of their career, the Sloan boys have felt it is better to manage themselves and take control of their creativity rather than be subject to the desires of big-time record companies who want to impress by being hip with the latest sound trends. This means that each Sloan album is done as the band wishes and if that means a 30-track album blending tracks barely a minute long with longer tracks, combining a variety of sounds and styles from piano rock to feedback guitar rock to piano ballads to hard core punk well then so be it.  Because of the lengthy track list it is quite easy to pull a good selection of favourite songs. Had the album been only half as long with all my favourites I am sure I would have been in total Sloan heaven. But wait! The tracks in between are totally necessary. This album flows. Trying to reduce it to fewer songs is like removing certain colours of M&Ms from the pack. While I won't listen to every track every time there is a wonderful feeling of continuity from beginning to end.  Personal favouites of mine are Jay's piano rocker ""Who Taught You to Live Like That?"" and ""Can't You Figure It Out?""; Chris's mix-tempoed ""Fading Into Obscurity,"" the slow and heavy ""People Think They Know Me"" and the short but enjoyable ""Will I Belong"" with its catchy rock chorus; Patrick's  beautiful and sad-sounding ""Listen to the Radio,"" and his hard core number ""HFXNSHC""; and Andrew's too short but heavy distortion feedback numbers ""I Can't Sleep"" and ""Something's Wrong."" Looking at the track list I could easily name a few more.  One final thought that occured to me is that with each Sloan album reviewers try to name which band each track sounds like, as Sloan are known for having a very mixed bag of influences. My impression with ""Never Hear..."" is that Sloan have come out sounding very much like themselves. There are songs that remind me of ""Smeared"", songs that remind me of ""One Chord to Another,"" and songs that remind me of ""Pretty Together."" This album is in a way a retrospective of their career but with all knew material. Though the critics are sure to be divided over the album I personally find this album to be extremely enjoyable.

But.....Out of ALL of the tours they have done, WHY did they choose the weakest out of all of the JP albums to highlight?  WHY?

There is one very split second shot, in which the camera is panning the audience and you see this guy giving the finger to Rob.  It's as plain as day and Rob looks at the guy and smiles.  How could the editors miss this? Interesting.   BUT........this DVD is worth it just for the BBC-TV stuff.  Seeing Priest from '76 performing ""Rocka-Rolla"" and ""Dreamer Deceiver"" is well worth the price.  I wish JP would release a multi-DVD set focusing on the '70's (their most creative and best period).  It is also interesting to watch the leather and spike progression of Rob and the band.  Watching Rob move from satin to leather and the various hair and facial stylings is fun.  Rob was trying to find a look that appealed to him and the numerous changes he went through are astounding.  I got more fun out of this than the concert. But getting the BBC stuff is just awsome!  MORE 70's material!

As with too much music criticism, the person making the music is reviewed rather than the music itself.  Especially with this album, I've read reviews that have said the influences are too much on his sleeve, but it makes no sense, take the song ""So Alive"", I've heard it called karaoke U2 and Unknown Pleasures-era Joy Division.  Now I'd say those two bands are hardly alike, unless you want to group them under the same catch-all banner of Post-punk.

Another great song is ""Majestic"", a long dramatic track that with its range of emotions would point the direction of their next album, Magnolia.

""Fly"" was originally released in Germany in 1996 and still has not been released domestically in North America, but it was sold as a 2-CD set during Sarah Brightman's La Luna tour. It is well worth the import cost. ""Fly"" is much more techno than Brightman's previous solo effort ""Dive"" from 1993. Also, there is no common theme linking the songs together, which range from operatic (""Question of Honour,"" ""Con Te Partiro"") to Europop/rock (""I Love You,"" ""Ghost in the Machinery,"" to pseudo-Goth moments on ""Murder in Mairyland Park."" There is even a duet with Tom Jones on ""Something in the Air"" and a duet with UB40's Chris Thompson on ""How Can Heaven Love Me."" If I had to give this album a genre I would have to say dance, although there some are slower songs (""Heaven is Here,"" ""Con Te Partiro""). Some of the lyrics are truly strange and enigmatic: (""The Fly"": Across a harvest of stars and constellations/We'll drink a starjuice on Mars/Coz I don't know why I am a fly) (""I Loved You"": They were the living years of stainless steel/ Praying for a time in a fortune wheel/ Smooth operator was where it's at/ So welcome all of you to the pleasure dome/ Of taking the look from the homeless zone/With digital aids in your telephone) This is an energetic, playful album that showcases a completely different creative side of Sarah that she hadn't shown before. ""Fly"" is a Europop techno dance album. Fans of her classical works will definitely want to avoid this as there is only one classical song, ""Con Te Partiro"" which appears on Sarah's other classical collections (on ""Timeless"" (""Time To Say Goodbye"" in North America), and her new collection ""Classics""). If you are interested in her operatic/ classical crossover albums, sample ""Eden,"" ""La Luna,"" or ""Classics.""

1231,300651,AKRRL7358VJIS,B000005HLO,Ilker Yucel,False,"This album is cold, and I mean that in more ways than one. It retains the icy harshness of a cold Norwegian evening, and it's cold in its cruelty, like the delivery of evil's wrath upon the Earth. Emperor were certainly not the first Norwegian Black Metal band, but their debut certainly proves they were the best. Everything about this album is brilliant, sinister, and evil...everything a cold Norwegian night should feel like. While most black metal vocals, with all their high-pitched shrieks, is ultimately laughable (case-in-point: Dani Filth), Ihsahn's piercing voice is terrifying and pulls you into the depraved world Emperor has created. The ""wall-of-sound"" created by the interplay between the brutal guitars and the lush keyboard arrangements is nothing short of incredible. This was the album that caused many black metallers to pick up a keyboard. Songs like ""I Am the Black Wizards,"" ""Beyond the Great Vast Forest,"" and ""The Majesty of the Nightsky"" form a full-on frontal assault on the senses, producing music that has the epic grandeur of classical symphonies or operas, but also has the brute chill of the Nordic land. While ""I Am the Black Wizards"" is probably their best known song, the closer ""Inno a Satana"" is my favorite on this album. Everything about this song, from Ihsahn's eerie clean vocals to the keyboards, everything is perfect. ""In the Nightside Eclipse"" is the black metal album to end all black metal albums.

1235,921295,A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B00914JWSW,commorancy,False,"Barbra Streisand's 'Release Me' offers a wide array of mostly outtake songs from different eras of her career.  But, let me start by saying what this album isn't.  It isn't brand new material.  At least, most of it isn't.  There is one song listed from 2012, but was only enhanced recently.  Track Order  Let's start by saying that this album is tracked out of order.  In fact, because this is mostly a retrospective release, the album should have been tracked in order of year of release rather than by whatever order Barbra decided it should have been.  In fact, the songs flow a whole lot better when played in order of year of release.  So, here is the track order by 'year' of release.  Note, there is one track that was recorded early in Barbra's career but was embellished just recently.  The below is the track order in which I listen which flows much better.  Willow Weep For Me (1967) Lost in Wonderland (1968) * I Think It's Going To Rain Today (1970) * Didn't We (1970) Mother and Child (1973) Try To Win A Friend (1977) With One More Look At You (From A Star Is Born) (1977) Being Good Isn't Good Enough (From Hallelujah, Baby!) (1985) How Are Things In Glocca Morra? / Heather On The Hill (From Finian's Rainbow / Brigadoon) (1988) If It's Meant To Be (2011) Home (From The Wiz) (2012)  * = removed from my playliast  Songs and Quality  The songs are all over the map in quality.  Some are simply amazing (Willow Weep For Me) to downright cringe-inducing (Lost in Wonderland). There is also the problem that, for whatever reason, Barbra thought it would be a good idea to open many of the songs with recording studio banter. While it is interesting and historical, it does disrupt from the flow of the music.  The good thing with iTunes is that once you rip the album, you can clip out this unnecessary banter from the flow using 'Get Info->Options->Start Time'.  You can then start each track several seconds in skipping the studio banter. Once you also do this, it makes the album a whole lot more listen-worthy.  Performance  Barbra's performances on nearly every song here are practically letter perfect. The problem, however, isn't her performance, it's the weak song material combined with poor mastering.  The strongest composition on this album is by far and away 'Willow Weep For Me' followed by 'Didn't We', 'Being Good Isn't Good Enough' and 'Glocca Morra'.  Barbra's best performances on this album include 'Willow Weep for Me' followed by 'Didn't We', 'Being Good Isn't Good Enough' and then 'Glocca Morra'.  It's also fairly amazing that 'Willow' didn't end up on Simply Streisand.  I can somewhat understand why, though.  'Willow' wasn't nearly as strong as 'Stout Hearted Man', 'My Funny Valentine' or any of the other tracks on 'Simply Streisand'.  However, I'm glad we're able to hear it now as it is still an amazing track and I hope there are more 60s tracks in her archives on the way towards release.  With that said, there are a few tracks on there that I can full well understand why they didn't make any release. The tracks 'Lost in Wonderland', 'Mother and Child' and 'I Think It's Going To Rain Today' all have issues of one kind or another.  'Lost in Wonderland' is bluntly, bad... both in composition and in Barbra's performance. Her voice does not at all lend itself to running the scales that this track apparently requires. With the composition, the melody just doesn't work and this song is just too odd even for Barbra to pull off.  Also, the song requires Barbra to follow the instrumentation along with her voice hitting the same notes. Unfortunately, Barbra is not great at that and this song suffers greatly for it.  Barbra needs a much more loose song structure where she's singing a melody that does not require following the notes the instruments are playing.  To her credit, she put her best effort out on the track, but it simply doesn't work.  'Mother and Child' are basically an A, B, A+B combined into a duet song.  Story and compositionally, the song is somewhat dark and gloomy describing a child's view of darkness and scary dreams in opposition to the adult who thinks it's all sugar plum fairies and jelly beans.  So, Barbra sings A as the 'adult', then she sings B as a 'child' and then both are combined together in a duet at the end.  The problem with this track is that while Barbra pulls off the 'adult' part quite nicely, the 'child' part doesn't really work.  Her voice is too 'adult' sounding for the child's part.  The duet at the end where she's singing over the top of herself also doesn't work. I'm not entirely sure how she could have made this one work any better.  Perhaps rethinking the 'child' part and approaching it vocally in a different way or by having an actual child sing the part.  This isn't one of the worst tracks here, but it definitely isn't one of her best.  With 'I Think It's Going To Rain Today', Barbra performs an amazing rendition. The trouble is, the recording of the piano is plain awful. The piano part is boring, monotonous and uninspired combined with an extremely bad mic placement and poor recording job on piano.  So, while Barbra's voice recording is crystal clear, the piano is muddy, droning, the playing uninspired and unlistenable. I'll bet that this was recorded such that the piano and her voice are intermixed.  So, as an engineer, you can't exactly remove the horrible piano part from this mix and make it better.  If the piano part could be replaced by a new part or by adding some strings, this track might actually be salvageable.  With the rest of the tracks, they have their ups and downs, but are recorded professionally and sound reasonably good, barring the mastering issue.  The trouble is that beyond those described above, they are all B quality songwriting.  Meaning, these are tracks that would not and could not ever hit the charts in any substantial way.  They're good enough for filler material on an album, but by no means is the quality that Barbra has always been known for.  Remastering  This album needed one more level of mastering polish to complete the sound for each of these tracks. For example, 'Willow Weep For Me' sounds dull and lifeless on the release. Running it through iZotope Ozone on even the most basic dynamics enhancement setting reveals the shine (and her voice) on this track.  Each of these tracks here could have been shined and polished through better mastering.  With a little TLC, this album could have sounded far better than it does today.",4,"12 23, 2012",A few gems in this back catalog release.,1356220800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,rainbow horrible performance star banter retrospective ups understand wide ever say glad actually composition try rethink plum listen-worthy lend get follow many wonderland thing professionally flow sure we're different placement note song glocca really polish entirely part funny odd let pull far kind bluntly home child array bore pull monotonous bet would actual hear mic embellish flow track bad practically rendition hit include filler remove finian's release disrupt sound idea songwriting intermixed run gloomy instrumentation record streisand meant greatly credit year example note remove they're loose every string replace performance rip away brigadoon baby much view effort think willow adult scary level could drone shine describe a+b might approach open itunes streisand's listen can't clip sings several dark instrument definitely problem today jelly trouble fairy well unfortunately hope one track new whatever make whole heather material lifeless win crystal stout wiz dull let's cringe-inducing unnecessary time uninspired bean barbra's describe top friend issue also master still weak voice dynamic reasonably duet plain born need play map story enhancement though eras reveals basic use always exactly clear rather record bar played i'll work nicely extremely sing career order offer however piano say song simply know unlistenable think job least poor enough hill mean structure hallelujah chart interest music fairly worst brand nearly little thing combine lot quality mother hearted able good set add list early shin perhaps mostly info->options->start ozone start morra recently man make compositionally i'm barbra playliast best along look sound well sugar another strong awful tlc track apparently quite somewhat way require substantial child's perfect archive mean izotope outtake towards great amazing letter put vocally rain suffers fact issue need salvageable historical beyond opposition reason follow go sound lose sing together performs sound studio full muddy downright decide album melody dream skip enhance complete even think rest basically mix second down weep require darkness remastering end make scale engineer hit strong valentine polish follow

I compare Underoath with the band AFI (A Fire Inside) because both bands have made drastic changes to their style of music. AFI moving from their california punk roots into a more melodic sound, including the use of synths on their new release, while Underoath (if anyone has their first two albums knows how odd it is to hear Dallas Taylor screaming in a death metal scream about Jesus Christ) has changed from their black metal/hardcore to a more pop-sounding, radio-friendly post-hardcore/screamo style. With a new vocalist, Spencer Chamberlain joining the band after the release of The Changing Of Times where Dallas left the band due to creative differences, they released They're Only Chasing Safety. This album was very radio-friendly and Spencer i think was a great addition to the band. With the release of Define The Great Line, he has proven me right. He was able to be more creative now that he had spent more time with the band and they really did a great job on this. Every song is great, the single Writings On The Walls being one of my favorite.

1253,365021,AQ9T9A5WJXVA9,B00000IOPB,Michael Brad Richman,False,"Sonny Rollins made several albums for the RCA Victor label, but ""Sonny Meets Hawk"" is his best and is easily in his top 10  recordings of all-time.  This material, which boasts one of the best remastering jobs on CD in recent memory, was recorded over three sessions in 1963.  By this time Sonny was beginning to explore some new, outward  directions in his playing.  Because of this some fans might be worried that a partnership with Coleman Hawkins, defintely a previous generation's saxophone colossus, would squelch Rollins.  Well you needn't be!  Coleman  Hawkins came to this session with an open mind, and his playing has never been more free.  Think of Sonny, as the rebelious youth who is mature enough to respect the father figure, but it is Hawk who is a cool enough dad to get hip to what the son is saying.  Just listen to their simultaneous solos on ""Summertime,"" and the mutual understanding and cohesion are perfectly clear.  I could go on about Sonny and Hawk, but this album has too many other wonderful facets I don't want to overlook.  The band on the first six tracks (the original ""Sonny Meets Hawk"" recorded during two sessions in July '63) is stellar with Paul Bley joining on piano, longtime Rollins comrade Bob Cranshaw alternating with Henry Grimes on bass, and an outstanding drummer who I have never  heard of before, Roy McCurdy.  All four of these men makes invaluable contributions to this album, but I want to take a moment to discuss the merits of the seldom recognized Henry Grimes.  Grimes is one of the 60s and the New Jazz's greatest bass players.  His style is similar to that of Scott LaFaro's, as both simultaneously maintain the rhythm and meter, yet play seemingly outside of it.  Additionally, the sound of the bass on this recording is some of the best I have ever heard on CD -- rich and full in tone, every note stands out.  As if ""Sonny Meets Hawk"" didn't have enough going for it, this remastered CD also includes three tracks from a February '63 session with Don Cherry.  These three tunes are phenomenal, and you've never heard three standards probed so thoroughly and  then turned inside out.  For this session, Grimes again lends his considerable talent on bass, and Cherry is reunited with Ornette bandmate  Billy Higgins on drums.  This session is no mere bonus, as the style easily melds with the original ""Sonny Meets Hawk"" album.  In all, ""Sonny Meets Hawk"" is a classic meeting of jazz giants bridging the generation gap.  Even more importantly, it is a shining example of the creative musical mind challenging itself to reach new levels of achievement.",5,"09 2, 2000",Two Generations Come Together As One,967852800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},33.0,,simultaneously drum record achievement stellar bandmate boast thoroughly paul importantly recognize recording rebelious sonny hawkins come stand ever men hip lafaro's piano player say colossus could cherry heard four figure might think roy victor open six scott mere listen billy turned get lends several jazz's many enough dad take generation creative reunite february musical all-time defintely join bass fan simultaneous seldom additionally hawk rca ornette great bley alternate tune one play new saxophone challenge cohesion original memory make solos bonus similar recent bob youth material drummer go free session overlook probe explore shin merit outward perfectly discuss meet july outside higgins first considerable want full cool meeting time mind outstanding gap album rhythm would rollins longtime cranshaw mccurdy top level track cd partnership worried mature also meld generation's maintain standard even inside band easily meter talent contribution henry sound rich bridge reach never father albums grime summertime moment play begin seemingly style comrade giant best two remastering facet record yet classic previous include son wonderful invaluable session make direction squelch respect go tone jazz well job example label three note phenomenal every coleman mutual understanding remastered clear

1256,543799,AXKCZJBLEN7CT,B0000BZYIS,D. Weber,False,"If you're a big fan of Dungeons & Dragons or simply tabletop fantasy RPGs in general, then this CD is right up your alley. Take it from a guy who's owned this album for two years now: Midnight Syndicate knew just what they were doing when they made it. Indeed, not only do they know their gothic horror; they know their fantasy pretty well, too.  Hailing back to the not-so-distant days of D&D 3rd Edition (Version 3.5, to be exact), Dungeons & Dragons: Official Roleplaying Soundtrack sets on creating the same kind of deep, dark, adventurous atmosphere that the game itself provides for it players, and on many occasions, it succeeds.  It all starts with the Prelude, which has a nice mystic quality to it--mysterious,  enchanting, and even a little foreboding. It's a nice short number that prepares listeners for the tracks yet to come. Afterwards, the audience is treated to the album's official introductory song, ""Troubled Times,"" which paints a picture of an era where monsters run rampant and the forces of evil construct mad schemes to conquer the realms and shape the world to the way they see fit. Honestly, every time I hear this song, I can just see the perfect intro video for the next great medieval fantasy video game: the arch villains mobilizing their forces, the heroes preparing for battle, the final moment when the conflict begins and sword and sorcery collide--good stuff.  Afterwards, Midnight Syndicate presents us with a solid mix of tunes meant to accompany the following RPG adventure moments:  1. Fights (""Final Confrontation"") 2. Episodes in dungeoneering (""Descent into the Depths"" and ""Secret Chamber"") 3. The introduction of monsters (""Army of the Dead"") 4. Magic and spell casting (""Eternal Mystery"") 5. Succumbing to a trap (""Deep Trouble"") 6. Coming across a key location in one's campaign (""Ruins of Bone Hill"" and ""Ancient Temple"") 7. Discovering treasure (""Relic Uncovered"")  The arrangement of the songs does the album justice, too, in that the tracks are sorted out so as to illustrate a more complete, epic adventure of their own. This seriously helps preserve the continuous, instrumental narration of the CD so that one can use it as background music for working on the computer as well as serving as the Dungeon Master of a given gaming session. Even the sound effects used in certain songs work well, from the clanging of swords in ""Skirmish"" (Who cares if they DO sound a little like two kids fencing with butter knives at the kitchen table?) to the clapping of thunder in ""Beasts of the Borderlands"" to the esoteric chanting heard in ""Chant"" and the subsequent ""Craft of the Wizard."" Truth be told, it's little things like this that help me get in the spirit to either DM my gaming sessions with friends or take it easy with my favorite fantasy novel all the way through the triumphant ""City of Sails,"" which concludes this album nicely with its rich orchestration and outstanding composition.  In short, even if D&D 3e isn't your cup of tea, Dungeons & Dragons: Official Roleplaying Soundtrack very well might be, as its songs provide just the right kind of atmosphere for the typical Dungeons & Dragons setting. I highly recommend it to tabletop RPG fans everywhere!",5,"08 18, 2008",D&D fans who don't have this album are really missing out on something.,1219017600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,beast force who's start player hear composition dragon time get favorite many sort borderland prepares song monster trouble provide serve knife picture paint table right preserve introductory exact kind session city album's depth stuff across version butter highly outstanding descent hear track official audience illustrate sound either fantasy sorcery two meant campaign tell every guy chant know episodes collide--good create hero like succumb soundtrack tabletop spirit evil come might clap clang sword horror sword dark shape effect dungeon trouble continuous deep care accompany friend intro one fight make help ancient own day certain help time game uncovered cup general cd game bone see esoteric year realms rich moment subsequent gothic yet run it--mysterious introduction craft give begin rampant narration nice concludes magic edition scheme use listener work hail nicely recommend enchant song simply justice next orchestration location everywhere secret take big foreboding chamber hill treasure alley fan music little thing set dead back quality triumphant succeed relic temple mobilize seriously adventure set used fit kitchen mad honestly background truth indeed provide construct confrontation kid one's novel discover present work prepare come typical session eternal knew well wizard final arrangement roleplay skirmish master mystic midnight way dungeoneering occasion sail fence rpgs world perfect not-so-distant moment thunder video tea chant great solid spell trap ruin tune dm conflict atmosphere arch army computer epic mystery adventurous number villain album d&d instrumental fan key complete even battle easy mix cast medieval syndicate treat rpg short conquer dungeon afterwards prelude era pretty follow

1258,747933,A388ZDFVK72VCA,B000WUCGZA,Cale E. Reneau,False,"Inevitably, the first time I ever hear an artist's music, I'm waiting for a moment; a single moment that will make me fall in love with them. If that moment never comes, it's rare that the artist will stay in my memory for long. For Jamie Seerman, here known as Jaymay, that moment came at about 1:40 into the opening track on her debut album, Autumn Fallin'. She sings of waiting on a man to ""make the first move"" so to speak, saying, ""I'm giving you the lead, so go on. Go on and take it. Don't fake it,"" before delicately whispering, ""shake it."" A shaker soon adds to the instrumentation and wide smile shoots clear across my face. I love it!  Jamie is a rarity in music these days. She manages to write intricate lyrics of specific moments in her life, utilizing every last detail to paint a clear picture of what she's trying to convey with her music. Such a task would do a lot of musicians in, so it's incredible to me that her songs are not only lyrically impressive but musically impressive as well (not to mention catchy as hell). On album opener, ""Gray or Blue,"" for example, she sings of a ""boy"" that she's interested in but doesn't have the courage to approach. She notes the color of his eyes, his mouth, the shape of his hands and body, and in doing so is able to convey the depths of her attraction without relying on cheap descriptors.  She's oddly specific with her lyrics as well, and they read like diary entries or poetry that you write and stash away in a drawer, never showing a soul. So while a line about a conversation in Grand Central Station or ""Super Keith"" emblazoned on a cup may be completely meaningless to the lister, the mere fact that she brings such things up proves her words as honest recollections rather than empty words. In fact, the true relatability of Jaymay's songs have nothing to do with the lyrics but the emotion and feelings that go behind them, that she brings out with her voice.  But enough about lyrics. Lyrics can only take an artist so far. Thankfully, Jaymay rarely disappoints on Autumn Fallin'. Her voice is lovely, and I can't help but compare her to Fiona Apple in that department. It's not near as deep or powerful, but it is jazzy and smooth. It fits the quaint nature of her songs perfectly. The albums first single, ""Blue Skies,"" sounds like a first single; complete with increased production and a loud, energetic refrain. It is a great song, and definitely one of the album's better tracks, but it's not necessarily indicative of the remainder of Autumn Fallin'. More often than not, Jamie's voice is only complemented by an acoustic guitar and some light drumming. ""Sea Green, See Blue"" is a gorgeous song that doesn't need a catchy chorus to delight (Jamie simply hums a melody where the chorus should be, to great effect). At over 6 minutes in length, it's far more ambitious than other pop songs out there, and with a delicately played saxophone, rhodes organ, and strings, it's a lot better as well.  Title track, ""Autumn Fallin',"" tells of a lost friendship. She sings, ""I believe it was you who I wanted to be walking next to. And I believe we were friends, and I believe we will be again."" It's a short, but effective song that sidesteps the boy-girl relationship theme that is touched upon quite often on the album. ""Ill Willed Person"" is one of my favorites, with a passionate performance from Jamie and a sing-along quality melody. In the chorus she cries, ""Love everything you've always loved,"" repeatedly in a voice that seems more raw and real than what we've been presented to up to this point. It's so refreshing and beautiful that repeat listens are inevitable.  But Autumn Fallin' has it's share of missteps as well. ""You'd Rather Run"" is almost 10 minutes long, but by 5 I found myself wanting her to wrap things up. The melody never really changes, nor does the organ-driven instrumentation that surrounds it, and as a result it gets tiring fast. The lyrics, however, are among the album's best. She sings of what seems to be an ex-lover with whom she's not on good terms, noting, ""Was there ever a moment, one small slice in history, when I took you seriously? When your belt and your shoes did not announce your poor taste so fearlessly? Cause that's news to me!"" Ha! On ""Hard to Say"" she actually scats, which actually fits her voice, but not the rest of the album. It's worth listening to, but come on...it's scatting!  Overall, however, Autumn Fallin' is a surprisingly impressive debut. Jaymay is one of the most talented songwriters I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, and for that, her few missteps are easily overlooked. The songs on this album are soaked in earnestness, and over the course of the past month I've found myself singing along and loving nearly every second of this fantastic debut! Jamie Seerman is an early candidate for Female Artist of the Year, and judging from her competition, she may just wind up with that (completely meaningless) title. Listen to a few samples and decide for yourself, but in my book, Autumn Fallin' is a must-buy!  Key Tracks: 1. ""Gray or Blue"" 2. ""Blue Skies"" 3. ""Sea Green, See Blue"" 4. ""Autumn Fallin'"" 5.

My review is based on listening to the CDs as well as seeing the band perform live. This isn't guitar-hero blues like Stevie Ray, Clapton, or Johnny Winter (I'm an old guy) - it's more like the old Slim Harpo and Howling Wolf and Lazy Lester recordings - think 50s-60s blues as done on the Excello and Chess labels. It's swampy sounding - good vocals, harmonica, and guitar with nobody overplaying. Good stuff...  I heard Pack Rat's Smokehouse (the Florida swamp blues band) at a barbecue and blues festival in Greenwood SC recently. They were a great live band both outdoors on the big stage and indoors in a hotel ballroom - where women stood in front of them dancing and yelling. The guitarist did a stunning solo set of Mance Lipscomb (plus Lightning Hopkins) songs on the main stage and Pack Rat joined him on harmonica, guitar, and guitar-body percussion the next morning at a fancy brunch. I dare say nobody there had ever heard ""brunch music"" like this (Lipscomb songs with slide played with a pocket knife, an original Jesse Fuller style song with Pack Rat on kazoo, Hooker type boogie, Jimmy Reed style too - plus Wolf-like droning songs). I am 66 years old and have loved the blues since I was a teen and have been to many festivals (blues and rock) and to many of the great blues clubs in the Carolinas, Atlanta, and DC. These guys are the real deal if you like it raw and basic played by ""old guys"" with experience - experience of playing it the right way. They sounded to me like a cross between Howling Wolf (vocals and harp) and Slim Harpo (guitar, bass, drums). It was like being present at an old Sun or Chess or Excello recording session. See them live and get the cds - they are also on Amazon Prime music.

1270,108738,A316COGDOL9D1L,B0000025GG,Kenbilt,False,"Mirrors is THE single MOST DIFFERENT album of all of BOC's 13 studio albums, and is generally not well-received by most hard-core fans who like to call it the ""disco album"". It is vastly underated, and due to this fact, some new-comers give it only one listen (if that) before wanting to hate it. I however, am one of the fortunate ones who remained patient with it and gave it an honest try, and I am glad I did! Though not in my top five BOC favorites, it is still a pleasure to listen to. It starts off with ""Dr. Music"", an up-beat little rocker that assures you that you're in for a somewhat ""different"" BOC ride than you're used to. My favorite songs are ""Dr. Music"", ""In Thee"", ""The Vigil"" (the ABSOLUTE BEST track on Mirrors), ""You're Not The One(I Was Looking For)"" and the perfect closer ""Lonely Teardrops"". These songs are amazing. ""Mirrors"" however, is one of those lame songs I just can't get into as much as other BOC songs- it sounds too ""sissy"". But on the album as a whole, I think that alot of people dislike it because it's BOC's most soft and radio-friendly album of them all. However, you yourself might feel differently if you ""step out of the box"" a little and stop thinking of BOC as strictly a good rock & roll band, but also as one of the most interesting one of the bunch who aren't afraid to take a risk and experiment a little. If you're a die-hard ""Black & White Period"" BOC fan, then chances are you WON'T like Mirrors. But if you like to hear them evolve from that era and experiment a little, you'll like Mirrors. I gave it only a four because all though it IS good, it is not typically the FIRST CD I pop in when in the mood for some BOC.

1271,634967,A4XJL4AW0ZI3V,B000BSM29I,Good Stuff,False,"Our friend from Croatia has his facts a little skewed.  They must have lost something in the translation.  I lived in L.A. at the time, and it was well known Ms. LuPone and Mr. Webber had not gotten along at all well during the London rehearsals of this show.  So much so that, in what I am sure was meant to be a slap in LuPone's face, the telephone ""hold"" music used for the ticket phones was Barbra Streisand's early recording of Norma's songs, not LuPone's.  As a matter of irrefutable fact, it was none other than Faye Dunaway who was announced for the L.A. run of the show.  It seems she had sold herself quite well to Mr. Webber.  Only problem was, reportedly, when rehearsals started in L.A. they found she couldn't even come close to singing the part.  He fired her, she sued, saying (and I'll never forget the quote) of Mr. Webber, ""This is another capricious act by a capricious little man"".  They settled out of court, La Faye got a couple buckets full of cash, which made her much more favorable to Mr. Webber, Glenn Close continued what is probably still her greatest performance, and La Faye and La LuPone sank into the background.  A curious footnote to all this is that Mr. Webber was apparently so turned off by all this, he never sanctioned a touring company for Sunset Blvd., and it therefore never toured the U.S., regardless of the reports that the touring produciton had been at least partially built and was eventually just written off.  As for this version of the American production, it sucks.  Stick to the original release.  Or, for that matter, give LuPone's version a try.  They're both good performances.  Patti sings the hell out of it, without a great deal of characterization (if you loved her in Evita.......), while Glenn acts the hell out of it, and actually sings it much better than you might suspect.

The album is so ambitious, so sprawling that it simply feels unfocused compositionally and the performances, while competent, feel ragged and indulgent. That said, there are passages in every piece where a strong melody and good ensemble performance coalesce if only for a few minutes at a time.  The final track ""Ritual"" fairs the best, thanks to strong thematic material and an exciting percussion section. However, even this piece sounds better as a live (albeit bisected) performance on the live set Yesshows that followed a few years later.

1308,333079,AKGF27HN0OF19,B000008GXD,Steven Sly,True,"By 1980 Jackson had released two albums of straightforward new wave / punk / pop and had achieved a high rate of success with both albums.  His 3rd album ""Beat Crazy"" would be the first to see Jackson start to move in different directions which would be a foreshadowing of what he would do for the rest of his career.  Along with his patented new wave / punk style, on ""Beat Crazy"" Joe would introduce elements of reggae, beat music, jazz and some swing to the mix.  Joe would move completely into swing territory with his next release ""Jumping Jive"", but keeps things fairly close to the vest on this one.  In fact some of the reggae experimentation was not that far removed from what bands like The Police were doing at the same time.  Commercially ""Beat Crazy"" was a bit of a let down for Jackson.  The title track was released as a single, but did not get a lot of airplay and the album would be his lowest charting up to this point in his career.  This would also be the last album from the original Joe Jackson band until ""Volume 4"" which would come out over two decades later.  I don't think that this album has aged as well as some of Joe's other ones.  Songs like ""Beat Crazy"", ""Battleground"", ""Pretty Boys"", and ""Fit"" all sound very dated.  Still there are some really good songs on the album with some great Jackson lyrics.  ""One To One"", ""In Every Home (A Nightmare)"", ""Mad At You"", ""Someone Up There"", and ""Biology"" are all solid tunes.  Despite the upbeat nature of much of the music, the lyrics are some of Jackson's most dark and cynical.

1310,1178422,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B0000071BV,Andre S.

The ever loyal R&B/soul/funk audience and her fans were still supporting her. But the air of bitterness and cynicism that would define the music world in the next decade was beginning to take hold. And the resulting atmosphere was not exactly friendly to her particular talents. It was around this time that Chaka was beginning to herself become a creative malcontent-that blended with a decade long period of hard living that was just starting to catch up with her. So Chaka did the best thing she could've done at this point. She teamed up with two of the biggest musical non conformists of their respective generations for this album: Miles Davis and Prince. That plus the production assistance of Chris Jasper and The System's David Frank resulted in what is probably her best overall album of the decade.    The album opens with the heavy synclaviar laden version of Stevie Wonder's ""Signed Sealed & Delivered"" before going into the often forgotten ""Soul Talking"",a mid tempo Brenda Russel funky soul number that has her lyrical stamp written all over it. Than there's Prince's dynamic ballad ""Eternity"",which has the same cinematic flavor as his 1983-1984 era Minneapolis sound. ""Sticky Wicked"" is a totally contemporary Prince funk number featuring Miles on trumpet and Chaka's first try at rapping on a rather disturbing tract on the end result of addiction. It's only appropriate she follow this with a wonderfully orchestrated version of Lady Day's ""The End Of A Love Affair"",arranged by Dave Grusin. ""It's My Party"" has a bouncy pop/funk flavor and is intensely catchy and ""Make It Last"" has Chris Jasper's Isley Bros. style keyboards all over this more textured variation of the same sound. ""Baby Me"" and ""Where Are You Tonight"" are both sleeker funk jams in a more Sade state of mind with slinky bass lines and she ends the whole thing,again with Miles on the standard ""I'll Be Around"",a beautifully dreamy arrangement.    I've never quite understood why this album pretty much got ignored in it's time. It certainly bent over backwards to appeal to the urban contemporary production ethic of the period. On the other hand,it's still firmly Chaka Khan as the sound of the album is built around her own individual flavors. The way this rather electronic album is produced is very much built on light and understated soloing,more often than note with a very bass oriented tone,with a very strong rhythm backing it up. Even the synthesized horns,one of the very few elements of 80's music production I'm not usually fond of,are used to very good affect on this occasion. When I first heard this album,I thought the music and Chaka's strident and sometimes softer use of vocal expression here made it very appealing. Though it has been said her voice at this point might've suffered due to the accesses of her lifestyle catching up with her. In the end this is one of Chaka's finest releases and really most promising productions.

1312,705023,A3TKL7X26QKKMO,B000SR0T3I,Jeremy Brackeen,False,"This is definitely one of my favorite metal albums of 2007 thus far. When I bought and listened to As I Lay Dying's brand new album ""An Ocean Between Us"" over the summer, I was definitely blown away and taken by surprise. Not only is this album blow the band's previous stuff right out of the water, it's also heavy as a sledgehammer and brutal as a train wreck and even melodic at times as well, I mean it's just downright catchy and addicting. I'm very glad that AILD really took a bigger step forward with this album and improving on so many things, including the addition of more melodic singing vocals, better songwriting especially the choruses, and even the guitar work as well. Guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hippa really took me by surprise with their thrash metal riffs, melodies, and solos, yes I said solos and some very good ones too. The breakdowns are as strong as ever too. Lead vocalist Tim Lambesis just rips throughout on this album with his powerful screams and you can actually understand what he's saying as well. Bassist and backing vocalist Josh Gilbert delivers some awesome melodic singing vocals especially on songs like ""Forsaken"", ""I Never Wanted"", and ""The Sound of Truth"", and his bass is very strong and follows the guitars very well too. And of course Jordan Mancino's slaughtering machine like double bass drumming is just unstoppable throughout as well. This guy is without question one of the best drummers in metal, and he definitely can drum with the best of them.  ""An Ocean Between Us"" starts off with the 1:15 instrumental ""Separation"" which has some nice mellow chords and a nice melodic riff, then moments later the relentless assault begins with the second track ""Nothing Left"" which includes a barrage of catchy surging guitar riffs and clobbering double bass drum assaults, and there's also a nice guitar solo as well. Next up is the title song which features a nice melodic chorus as well as some fast thrashing riffs and more great drum work. Track four ""Within Destruction"" (another highlight and my favorite song on the album) is an absolute pure metal assault of raging howls, fast train wrecking double bass drums and deadly rampaging riffs that definitely bring vintage Slayer and Lamb of God to my mind. At the 1:03 mark the song breaks down to a slower steady pace with a nice catchy melody and some whispering vocals, but then at the 2 minute mark, the ruthless assault resumes. My favorite part of the song is where Tim is bellowing out the line ""All That is Hope Within Destruction"". This song no doubt would definitely give Slayer and Lamb of God a big run for their money. Another highlight and favorite ""Forsaken"" a big catchy brutal yet melodic number which features an addicting guitar melody at the beginning as well as some more punishing riffs, a headbanging double bass drum beat, and an absolutely addicting melodic singing chorus while track six ""Comfort Betrays"" is an all out thrashing headbanging assault with more hammering double bass drum patterns, powerful riffs, and a blazing solo to boot. The next track ""I Never Wanted"" is a nice slow mid tempo ballad which features, a nice steady drum beat, slow lurching riffs, and Tim's screaming vocals really blend well with Josh's clean singing vocals. Track nine ""The Sound of Truth"" another highlight features a fast driving double bass drum beat, killer riffs as well as some catchy melodies and an awesome careening solo to boot. ""Wrath Upon Ourselves"" is another punishing assault that features more rampaging double bass drums, gut punching riffs, a pair of nice solos, and Tim's visceral roars as well as Josh's melodic vocals in the chorus, and finally we come to the closing track ""This is Who We Are"" which starts off with some slow melodic chords, then quickly a barrage of headbanging riffs and mean double bass drum assault come in to the playing field. The chorus is very addicting too. Then around the 3:30 mark we have a nice catchy piano interlude near the end of the song.  Jeremy's song ratings: 1. Separation (1:15) - 4/5 2. Nothing Left (3:43) - 5/5 3. An Ocean Between Us (4:13) - 5/5 4. Within Destruction (3:54) - 10/5 My favorite song 5. Forsaken (5:18) - 5/5 6. Comfort Betrays (2:50) - 5/5 7. I Never Wanted (4:44) - 5/5 8. Bury Us All (2:23) - 5/5 9. The Sound of Truth (4:20) - 5/5 10. Departed (1:40) - 4/5 11. Wrath Upon Ourselves (4:01) - 5/5 12. This is Who We Are (4:54) - 5/5  Overall, I definitely rank As I Lay Dying's ""An Ocean Between Us"" among some of favorite metal albums of 2007 including Machine Head's ""The Blackening"", Megadeth's ""United Abominations"", Chimaira's ""Resurrection"", Arch Enemy's ""Rise of the Tyrant"", Dream Theater's ""Systematic Chaos"", Behemoth's ""The Apostasy"", Type O Negative's ""Dead Again"" Immolation's ""Shadows in the Light"", and so forth.  Bottom line, if you're a fan a As I Lay Dying, metal, metalcore, or just heavy music in general, you should definitely give ""An Ocean Between Us"" a shot.

I think this was the second album I bought of theirs after Bandwagonesque and I was not disappointed.  Therefore I agree with M.

Justin (naturally) took that vibe with him to his solo studio recordings. Now that it's 2013 the 1st part of The 20/20 Experience is here (it's been here since late March). Anyway, the CD is good. I like almost all of the songs on the album and the bonus tracks are solid (I really, really like ""Dress On"" which has this charm about it vocally during the bridge that I can't get over). The album can be testing because most of the tracks are overly long. It can be really annoying. Like some other reviewers have already said there are a couple of tracks that are only 3 or 4 minutes which is fine. I myself don't mind long tracks as long as they keep you interested. Some of the tracks here though are long for the sake of being long. I see he wanted to mimic the feel of some of his tracks on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FutureSex-LoveSounds/dp/B000H305U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FutureSex / LoveSounds</a>&nbsp;where it was part song and part awesome interlude. However, not all the songs that are extended in length keep your attention every time you play them. I think he totally overdid this idea and listening to the album in full can become tedious at times.  My favorite tracks on the deluxe are as follows: ""Dress On"", ""Tunnel Vision"" (my favorite on the standard edition), ""Strawberry Bubblegum"", ""Pusher Lover Girl"" and maybe ""That Girl"". ""Suit & Tie"" is a solid single and it totally grew on me. ""Mirrors"" is alright. I guess I like it more than I hate it but it could be better.  The album as a whole is pretty decent. I like how there isn't really a whole lot of pop going on here and that all in all it's probably his most R&B-driven record to date. I love the occasional throwback feel to some of the songs too. The album's real downfall is that many of the tracks are just too long and could have easily been cut by 2 or so minutes. Other than that I'm happy how it turned out.

FANTASTIC PLANET is a shockingly huge leap beyond the band's first two LPs, which were merely decent. In fact, it's an epic masterpiece.

The guitar work is just perfect; not too self-indulgent, but consistently engaging and impressive.  Everyone is bound to have their own picks for highlight tracks, but I'm partial to the final third or so of the album. I could listen to the sequence from ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" to ""Daylight"" on repeat all day.  FP was a little before my time, but whenever I listen, it shocks me that it wasn't a more mainstream hit alongside releases from Smashing Pumpkins, Tool, and others of the same era. There are at least 3 or 4 brilliant singles on here that epitomize everything that was great about 90s rock, perhaps none more-so than ""Stuck on You."" To me, that song is every bit the 90s alternative classic that ""Today"" or ""Black Hole Sun"" were, even if it didn't get half the recognition from the masses.

Not that the latter wasn't touching, but I think that ""Legends"" has more personality.  Some people might say that Horner was channeling Aaron Copland, but to be honest, I simply don't care.  This is his best composition from his 90's output, period.  I mean the theme in the first track, as well as the theme for the Ludlow family, are truly masterpieces in their own right; when I heard them in the movie, I shed tears because these compositions fit perfectly with the drama and the beautiful landscapes you see on screen.  In spite of the similarity of the track 'Revenge' with Horner's 'Hightland's Execution' from ""Patriot Games"", the beauty and the power of the aforementioned themes is overwhelming enough to forget that track.

When she first arrived on the scene, she was not only a fresh, beautiful face, who could dance her BUTT off, but she also had fresh material to sing about. The thing I loved and respected about Ciara was she was absolutely stunning, she wore the baddest shoes I have ever seen (and still does :)  ), she carried herself like a lady, yet sexy at the same time, and she knew how to make you get up and dance without subjecting her listeners to sexually suggestive lyrics. Now-a-days, Ciara has really ""settled"" for stripper-influenced choreography , but also, her lyrics allow you to make the assumption that she is quite a promiscuous female. I don't know....I understand Ciara is grown, but her style has changed...for the worst (and that is just MY OPINION--please do not attack me for my personal opinion because this is my review). Don't get me wrong, there are a few songs on the album that are absolute BANGERS: I.e. ""Gimmie Dat, Girls Get Your Money, Wants For Dinner, and I Run It,"" but I guess I just expected a little more from her. Judging by the video/song ""Basic Instinct (You Got Me),"" I just knew Ciara was going back to her roots and make more hits with Missy Elliot, Jazze Pha, Lil John, etc. with songs such as ""1, 2, Step, Lookin At You, That's Right, Like A Boy, Promise, Get Up, C.R.U.S.H., etc (I'm sure you get the point), but she didn't do that with this album. Don't get me wrong....Ciara has made a major improvement from her previous disappointing album that is entitled ""Fantasy Ride,"" but I still expected more from Ciara! I love her R&B/Crunk music and I truly feel as though she is loosing her roots. I'm not saying the album is complete trash, but she could have done better.

1343,142780,A30XZO9A3H5BYH,B000002GFC,Don Schmittdiel,False,"I must say, I believe this disc is the way to go in putting together a Cream collection, even if you are relatively serious about the band's music, as I am.  The band had a regrettably short lifespan, offering only 4 studio releases (two of them augmented by live versions of previously released songs), and most of their best tracks are included here.  This collection, in particular, renders the band's debut album, 'Fresh Cream', and their most ambitious work, the double-LP 'Wheels of Fire', obsolete.  Cream's swan song, 'Goodbye' really isn't even a collectable, so only 'Disraeli Gears' contains valuable tracks that cannot be found on 'the very best of Cream'.  In addition, all of the tracks are remastered, and we have the presence of an unusual single release.  To top it all off, we finally have a Cream disc where the producer made an effort to include some informative historical information on the band in the form of liner notes, and detailed information on the individual tracks, and several unique photographs of the band.  It's a thoughtful and comprehensive compilation.  The CD starts off with the band's first single, the enigmatic 'Wrapping Paper'.  Its unassuming pop posture is the last thing you would expect from the band, whose members were already steeped in the blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz.  It's more of a curiosity than anything else.  The song somehow made it into 'Fresh Cream' as well. We are then treated to the finer offerings from the debut LP.  'I Feel Free', 'N.S.U.', 'Sweet Wine', 'I'm So Glad' and 'Spoonful' are arguably the best selections from that disc.  Five selections from 'Disraeli Gears', the band's 1967 breakout classic follow.  'Strange Brew', built on the foundation of 'Lawdy Mama', 'Sunshine of Your Love' (the band's first top five hit), 'Tales of Brave Ulysses' and 'Swalrb' are easy selections.  The inclusion of 'We're Going Wrong', however, is certainly debatable, especially when tracks such as 'Take It Back', 'World of Pain', and 'Dance the Night Away' lie in wait.  I would have scratched 'We're Going Wrong' in favor of any of the other three standout tracks from this disc.  These three tracks are probably enough to make 'Disraeli Gears' demand shelf space next to 'the very best of Cream'.  'Wheels of Fire' is gutted by 'the very best of Cream'.  Every elite song is present, unless you're partial to the overdone instrumentals from the live disc, or Jack Bruce's 'Passing the Time' and 'As You Said', songs I would not consider essential to a Cream collection.  There are seven songs included from 'WoF', and each is a winner, with 'White Room', 'Deserted Cities of the Heart', and the live version of 'Crossroads' being the obvious standouts.  I actually sold off my copy of 'Wheels of Fire' when I purchased this disc.  'Goodbye' is certainly under-represented.  'Badge', being one of Cream's finest compositions, was a foregone conclusion for this disc.  Since the rest of the disc is mostly live versions of previous releases by Cream, there wasn't much else to choose from.  Instead, the producers elected to include the May, 1968 single 'Anyone For Tennis', which is almost as pop as 'Wrapping Paper', and had every bit as much success (none) on the charts.  It is nevertheless a fun, laid-back listen.  Compilation discs often disappoint in one way or another, and while this one isn't perfect, it's darn close.  So unless you're a completist, or tuned into the powerful and often lengthy live productions the band made of their studio tracks over the years, it may well be the only investment in Cream you'll ever need to make.",5,"11 17, 2004",creme de la Cream,1100649600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},5.0,,jack offering selection ever say glad lengthy start powerful disc posture actually room last follow tennis double-lp thing expect certainly cream we're goodbye note song contains disappoint partial fun regrettably really gutted success passing release believe version bit almost version n.s.u information would heart thoughtful track sunshine standouts finally hit band include laid-back release fresh instrumentals release nevertheless producer build presence two previously go essential every may dance tune seven steep away render wrap much effort none overdone informative sell liner listen several wait unique serious wine obvious favor one conclusion crossroad love city make debatable relatively sweet strange offering curiosity first time purchase rhythm top foregone standout cd brave five year bruce's choose put gear since classic scratch three elect work investment wheel fire foundation however song need night next finer anyone enough take must whose chart find music debut ulysses back producer wrong free consider single fine shelf under-represented unassuming obsolete particular present mostly white unusual paper close tale lifespan somehow deserted form blue augment make i'm best often previous well individual say another remastered unless compilation member pop demand arguably way completist darn space world perfect swalrb composition lawdy swan addition already feel pain cream's brew lie include breakout historical comprehensive live go detail probably together lp collection inclusion copy cannot studio especially album disc spoonful disraeli even easy mama else rest production winner ambitious treat short badge photograph elite band's instead wof valuable collectable jazz anything enigmatic

Though not a huge commercial success in the U.S., cracking the Top 40 only twice with Here Comes the Night and Mystic Eyes, the band still had a lasting impact on American music. In addition to their iconic cover of Baby Please Dont Go (a single that failed to crack the stateside Top 100 but remains as familiar as if it had), Morrisons original Gloria proved to be one of the foundational pillars of garage and punk rock.

Some will be disappointed that true stereo mixes weren't used everywhere they were available, but mono is what just about everyone heard in the mid-60s, and the punch of these mixes makes the band sound all the more visceral. Neither Morrison nor the band ever seem to lose steam, even when the tempo slows they remain ferocious, and their mix of original and cover material is seamless.

When Grindcore first started out, bands like Napalm Death, Carcass and Extreme Noise Terror where the godfathers of the genre. Then Terrorizer came, and blew the lid off everybodies heads! Terrorizer was what not only gave the early Grindcore bands the push, speed, and noise it needed, but as well gave them the modern day song structure.

1351,871614,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B0050546IM,Gregory William Locke,False,"With the Sub Pop-issued Within and Without, Washed Out's honcho Ernest Greene becomes the latest in a seemingly endless line of New Saviors of Sound. The vibe and appeal here, however, really isn't that complex; Greene sings quite a bit like Panda Bear, a droning vocal backed by distant echoes. If he sounded any more like the Panda, he'd have to pay the man royalties, his whimsy less and his melody more.  The music of Within, however, is slightly more complex than Greene's derivative vocal appeal. Keyboard and synth layers stack high, creating an atmospheric backdrop that's driven by programmed drums and buried baselines. You don't really hear guitar riffs, horns, piano or even strings on this record. The sound here is straight synthetic - a vibe that, vocals aside, resembles Enigma more than it does, say, Animal Collective. Enigma, that is, had they scored some John Hughes films in the 1980s.  On that note, I suppose it's time to mention the band - nay, the album - that we can only assume is largely responsible for the existence of Within and WIthout, and maybe Washed Out in general. That record, m83's Saturdays=Youth, has been the blueprint for a number of artists over the last two or so years, helping usher in this often pathetic 80s revival trend. Within isn't on the pathetic side of the fad, as it does offer a unique appeal that's made perfect for the more yuppie, more gaggy corners of the indie rock scene (did I really just type ""indie rock scene""?).  What we end up with is a set of nine clever, if simple, compositions that are above all else moody and memorable. One standout track, ""Before,"" feels so much like a hipster's version of Enigma's ""Return to Innocence"" that I can't help but assume it will eventually find a wider audience, probably via a TV commercial or dramatic film (or, ya know, a ""Grey's Anatomy"" episode). It's high moments like these, where Washed Out take the production deeper and give more attention to melody than style, that I understand why a punk- and grunge-focused label like Sub Pop would chance their weight behind such a band.  The only question is: Will the music of Washed Out age well like, say, Portishead? Or will this cinematic 80s sound be another tossed-off ""What was I thinking"" moment in the history of modern indie music? Though I have been enjoying the record just fine, my money is on the later.

Nevertheless, I listened to whole album and it really touched me.  I've always like Hard Rock and soft ballads and this album has touched both beautifully. Morning View, the most artistic, beautifully written from Incubus will face the same criticism many other bands get from die hard fans:  ""It's nothing like their previous albums"" With that in mind, they'll lose some fans, but will gain so many more with Morning View.  I compare this new album release to Stone Temple Pilots new release(Shangri-la Dee Da).  Both albums are giving out the same effect among new and old fans.  Ironically both bands had recorded around the same time and privately in rented Malibu studio homes rather than a record studio. Highlights of this album are ""Wish You Were Here"", their first single, a radio friendly, commercial song.  ""Just A Phase"", a deeply melodic and emotional passage that gives me the feeling of looking straight into the eyes of your high school crush.  ""Mexico"" and ""Echo"" two more soft melodies.

1355,136773,A3MW0G4ICFUHWX,B000002BUI,Lubug,False,"Savage Garden, to me, is arguably one of the best male duo's we've had in a while. They ruled the 90s, with hits such as 'Truly Madly Deeply', 'I Want You' and 'To The Moon & Back'. During that time I was in my single and early double digits, but I still had a knack for what I liked. And Savage Garden was something I LOVED. My Mom bought the CD at a Half Price Books for some cheap price, but I would've paid full price had we known that it was going to be so good. I can't say there is one song that we don't like on this album-all are great and make for the perfect driving CD.  Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones both had great voices-an essential part of making a duo group. Both contained some of the 80s flair we all love, as well as a newer, more modern sound. Their voices were amazing, both having excellent ranges, which were frequently showcased in their falsetto based songs. The boys also had catchy songs and near provocative lyrics working for them, the lyrics providing originality and new ideas for a newer generation and the songs providing good radio time for the singles.  Diversity in song choices carried them far. The whole album is surprisingly balanced with a mixture of slower songs and ballads, and faster songs such as 'Tears of Pearls', 'Carry on Dancing' and 'Break me Shake me'- which are personal favorites.  There's not much more to say other than that this CD is AWESOME and I'd recommend it to ANYONE. I only wish they hadn't broken up...and they hadn't made a crappy CD before they did.

1356,271454,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000035F5,Robert Moore,False,"American musical tastes have always baffled me.  Mediocrities extraordinaire like Britney Spears, Linkin Park, Mariah Carey, John Mayer, and Dave Matthews sell millions of records, while genuinely talented souls like Mark Lanegan remain unknown except to music connoisseurs.  A few know him as the front man and resident genius of Screaming Trees, others as a solo artist, a few more as sometimes member of Queens of the New Age, and a few Isobel Campbell fans as the guy who helped make her latest album so stunningly special.  But Mark Lanegan should someone anyone who is obsessed with great music should know well.  I honestly believe that if you love great music, there are at least three albums featuring Mark Lanegan that fall into the category of ""Must Own"":  his incredible solo album WHISKEY FOR THE HOLY GHOST, the superfine Screaming Trees anthology OCEAN OF CONFUSION, and his recent effort in support of Isobel Campbell on her amazing BALLAD OF THE BROKEN SEAS (most of the songs are by Campbell, but he contributes some great supporting vocals, especially a killer version of Hank Williams's ""Ramblin' Man"" and on the album's great closing song ""The Circus is Leaving Town"").  This was Lanegan's second solo album.  The first one, THE WINDING SHEET, was one downer of an album.  Bleak, deeply atmospheric, introspective, and seriously unfocused, it represented a significant break from his work with the Screaming Trees.  Whatever fans of that band were looking for in a Mark Lanegan solo project, that was definitely not it.  WHISKEY FOR THE HOLY GHOST is not completely dissimilar from THE WINDING SHEET, but it is better conceived, the songwriting is infinitely sharper, and the melancholy is redeemed by one exquisitely melodic song after another.  To this day, Lanegan has not been involved on an album--not with Screaming Trees or anyone else--that was so superb from first cut to the last.  One thing that really comes out on this album is what a low, deep voice Lanegan has.  In the Screaming Trees, it is clear he pushes his voice up to its highest possible range, but here he allows it to fall into its natural, low range.  Most rock bands force the singers to be high tenors, even a natural baritone like Lanegan.  But as a tenor myself, I have to admit that baritones can project a world weariness and ennui that no tenor can intimate.  His voice here is perfect for the regret, sadness, and angst he wants to project.  What is most amazing about this album is how great the songs are from first to last.  Lanegan's songwriting with the Screaming Trees was never this consistent (one reason why the best way to get to know their music is from the generous anthology OCEAN OF CONFUSION).  He would pen several gems that would sandwich some astonishingly bland cuts.  No filler here, however.  The contrast here is between some astonishingly great songs and songs that are at worst at least interesting (e.g., ""Ride the Nightingale"").  My favorite cut is probably ""El Sol,"" filled with wonderful musical moments and a casually wonderful vocal.  ""Carnival"" (which I keep thinking should be entitled ""Freak Show"") is very nearly as good, while ""The River Rise,"" which kicks the album off, is on their par.  But there are 3 or 4 other cuts very nearly as strong as these.  So, please do your part to fight the flood of mediocrity that the music industry tries to drown us with.  We don't have to accept all the garbage that they tell us we ought to like!  We can support great music like this instead!  Do your part.  If you don't already have this great album, get it.

1366,1110559,A33NV8O4A21OCR,B0000021KF,Azrael,False,"(4.5 Stars if possible) This is definitely my favorite Malevolent Creation album featuring bassist Jason Blachowicz on vocal duties. Most people I know who listen to MC prefer the album ""Eternal"" to this release, but I find ""In Cold Blood"" to be the superior release simply because it is a more frenetic, in-your-face type of album. The songs on this album are, overall, much shorter and much faster than those on ""Eternal"" and lack some of the technicality. However, what this album lacks in song length or technicality it more than makes up in brutality. All the songs on this album are played at break-neck speeds and are very entertaining to listen to. There are also more songs presented here, and this disc is still more than satisfying to throw in and listen to only a couple quick songs if you so desire or don't have time to listen to lengthier releases. The blasts on this album are great, but the drumming isn't varied quite as much as on ""Eternal"". However, despite the shortfalls just mentioned, ""In Cold Blood"" is my top pick of the albums featuring Blachowicz on vocals. When comparing this to the rest of Malevolent Creation's catalogue, ""In Cold Blood"" is right up near the top on my list, only clearly surpassed by ""Envenomed"". If you like this album a lot, I VERY HIGHLY recommend that you check out their newest release ""Will To Kill"". The new vocalist (Kyle Symons from Hate Plow) sounds pretty similar to Blachowicz and the drum production is some of the best I've ever heard for a death metal band. Overall, this is a fantastic release and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre, whether you're just getting into death metal or want to see what some of MC's material sounded like without Brett Hoffman.

Unlike psychedelia, punk, or (heaven help us) grunge, there never seemed to be a coherently constructed philosophy behind what was being released by a vast array of almost-popular artists. But when you listen to The Pleasure Principle, you begin to realize that there was some seriously profound subtext at work amongst the better artists of the period, something beyond irony and WAY beyond satire that appealed, however momentarily, to a spectrum of vaguely disenfranchised adolescents and post-adolescents, people eager for music with the same relative intensity of punk, but channeled in a far more conceptual, aesthetic way.

To me The Argument isn't even one of the Fugazi's best albums and probably would come in tied for last with Steady Diet Of Nothing as my least favorite Fugazi albums. It seems like they really lost a step with this album and like Steady Diet most of the songs are soft and mid tempo and not as expiremental as the previous two albums. The Argument also marked a first in Fugazi's 16+ year history with the additions of outside artists playing on the album. Fugazi has always been Ian, Guy, Brendan, and Joe and on this record there are guest musicians which really don't add much to the overrall sound.

1382,1165881,A92F571Y9MTW6,B000004AOT,Perverted Alchemist,False,"In 1975, filmmaker Sydney Pollack (Known for his later films ""Out Of Africa"", ""Tootsie"" and ""The Firm"") teamed up with actor Robert Redford for the political thriller ""Three Days Of The Condor"". Also starring Faye Dunaway and Max Von Sydow, the film was based on the James Grady novel ""Six Days Of The Condor""- released a year before the film. The picture centered around Redford's character- whose code name was ""Condor""- who comes back to work from lunchtime, only to find all of his co-workers shot to death. He spends most of the film on the run and in hiding, refusing to trust anyone inside his job at the Central Intelligence Agency.  His reluctance to trust leads him to stumble upon clues which lead him to find out that his superior was behind the whole thing. While the film was a box office success and critically praised, another thing that garnered attention to the film was the soundtrack.  Released on Capitol Records, the score was the entire work of jazz pianist Dave Grusin. The mostly instrumental soundtrack has its moments where it sounds like anything but the score to a political thriller, and other times it sounds not too far removed from what Grusin would continue to do later on in his career. Singers Jim Gilstrap and Marti McCall make their appearances on the album's relatively small number of vocal tracks. Gilstrap sings on two versions of ""I've Got You Where I Want You""- the original and the reprise (The reprise would later be known as the sample behind Amerie's 2002 single ""Why Don't We Fall In Love""). McCall appears on the jazzy rendition of the Christmas classic ""Silver Bells"". There are great arrangements on here, however, being this is a film score, most of the songs range from the one to three minute mark. The soundtrack was reissued in 1997 and as of now, both original and reissue copies are scarce and rather expensive to come by.

Most Van Halen songs in the Roth era are too simple -some to the extent that they lack the complexity that most ""jingles"" do.  There are a few 'average' songs from their debut, such as ""Runnin' With The Devil,"" ""You Really Got Me,"" Aint' Talkin' 'Bout Love,"" and ""Jamie's Cryin'.""  But of those, none really stand out though at least they're solid. That's not to say that I completely diss Van Halen or am not a fan of them.  I have my own CD-R best hits compilation of VH, in fact.  It does, however, only consist of 11 songs from about 8 albums, which is an average of only 1 song per album.

1391,1365796,A3LYPHBD1PIWVY,B002A5ZLHU,James A. Altena,True,"I fully concur with the enthusiasm of previous reviewers for this set. Volkmar Andreae was a lifelong champion of the symphonies of Bruckner; throughout much of his 43-year tenure as conductor of the Zurich Tonhalle orchestra, he conducted continuous three-year cycles of the nine canonically numbered symphony, with three symphonies featured each season.  These recordings, however, instead come from a 1953 series with the Vienna Symphony (not to be confused with the Vienna Philharmonic).  They are in well-preserved monaural sound, which while not competitive with the modern stereo sound these symphonies ideally demand is still quite listenable.  In addition to preserving the work of an early Bruckner champion from an era when those symphonies needed special pleading to gain a hearing, it also preserves an important interpretive approach to Bruckner which has become virtually extinct.  Those who listen to Bruckner performances from the pre-stereo era by figures such as Georg-Ludwig Jochum (the brother of Eugen Jochum) Oswald Kabasta, and Bruno Walter (his live broadcast performances), know that Bruckner performances were generally much swifter than the increasingly spacious, even ponderous, renditions that have now become the norm.  Andreae is very much of a piece with that outlook; these are readings distinguished by fleet tempi, taut rhythmic spring, and leanness and transparency of texture without any loss of weight and power.  Excepting the monaural sound, this set is the perfect curative to offer those who complain that Bruckner is too slow and hence boring.  As a bonus, the Te Deum features a top-notch solo quartet.  While its sonic limitations keep this from being anyone's first choice for a Bruckner cycle (my endorsement for that still goes to Eugen Jochum's first set for DG), it definitely should be acquired by anyone who wants to know how Bruckner was conducted by maestros who actually were born and came to young adulthood while the composer himself was still alive, and thus were far closer to what might be termed ""period performance practice.""",5,"04 20, 2013",An extremely important historical document,1366416000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},4.0,,know outlook texture performances virtually ponderous power fleet enthusiasm reviewer go limitation much philharmonic demand quite gain work performance recording champion distinguish andreae sonic come top-notch however dg ideally approach plead slow generally practice come actually confused might conduct perfect rhythmic pre-stereo young bruno listenable listen conductor want important leanness symphony modern anyone hearing definitely addition three-year reading continuous maestro preserve norm acquire monaural transparency season te broadcast loss curative taut stereo jochum's orchestra offer series need complain except vienna volkmar hence oswald bonus tempo far live eugen quartet bruckner become tonhalle spring bore first kabasta weight anyone's fully early swifter brother thus zurich interpretive nine alive composer also georg-ludwig still even closer period solo increasingly well-preserved sound extinct spacious endorsement choice bear special walter piece lifelong canonically tenure set symphony cycle adulthood term instead previous without jochum throughout concur figure feature rendition preserve cycle three competitive number keep era deum feature

1394,841206,A3MIQAJ9SRCDUO,B003L194Y8,Howard,False,"I want to start this review off by saying I'm in no way, shape or form a ""Drake hater"". I don't go on blogs bashing him and there is no emotion attached to my words, unlike a lot of people who will give this CD low reviews.  With that said, the greatest flaw this album has is Drake himself, I'm afraid to say. Drake's lyrics are very one dimensional on this. For the duration of the CD he's either being extremely arrogant (in Jay-Z fashion), or rapping about random nonsense that doesn't mean anything. I mean, there are some songs where he is clever in some respects, but the majority of his lines are just corny little punchlines and rambles about nothing. ""I'm busy getting rich, I don't want no trouble. I made enough for two people boy, stunt double"" [Up All Night] I also find major displeasure in listening to his voice. I felt it very hard to listen to Drake's monotone voice and fake American southern accent, all the way through. His voice is nasally and tracks that could have been really good become cringe worthy because of this.  Production is decent, but feels low budget. Just about every song has a hollow opening to it, like a huge chunk of the puzzle is absent. This could be because Drake decided to go with relatively new/unknown producers for the greater part of the album. Many of the beats on 'Thank Me Later' sound the same, generally constructed with a simple drum pattern and some light synthesizers thrown into the mix. Varied instrumentation or sampling isn't something that you should expect here. Drake is arguably the most popular rapper in hiphop at the moment, so I don't really understand the low quality beat selection. I would have thought that being the most popular rapper in the world equated to having the 'big boy' hiphop producers on the album.  In terms of guess performances; there are many, and most outshine Drake with better verses. Jay-Z's charisma on his feature [Light Up] was great and it makes you wonder why Drake even decided to jump on a song with him. Even Lil Wayne outperforms Drake [Miss Me], which isn't surprising considering Drake's style and how it seems to be a more annoying rendition of Wayne's rap style. The one guest I really didn't like for this album was Alicia Keys, which I HATE to say because she's my favorite singer. I didn't think her voice added to the opening song [Fireworks] and the crooning bit she did at the end ruined the song for me. (Still love her though)  As a whole, this isn't bad. As mentioned earlier, the problem is with Drake. If a rapper with a better voice and greater versatility, did these tracks over, (Maybe like a Common) they would be amazing (With exceptions like 'Fancy' which I don't think can be saved) The best parts of Thank Me later are in the choruses. Drake isn't that great a singer, but he writes wonderful melodies and simple yet intriguing lyrics on the hooks. Though, sometimes they felt misplaced because he's writing his rap lyrics from an egotistical standpoint, then suddenly transitioning into a beautifully unique chorus that generally doesn't have much connection to his raps. At times it felt as though the hooks where strategically planted there to make light of the terrible sounding rap verses.  So does Drake live up to his hype? Well, I wouldn't call this album ""best"" of the year. (That title is reserved for Nas/Damian Marley's album, 'Distant Relatives') But Thank Me Later serves as a solid debut, especially when pared with other recent garbage mainstream hiphop has been producing. This is NOT something that will satisfy you for years to come, or even for the rest of this year...but it does have some catchy choruses you can enjoy for the moment.

1401,700268,A3M9JF0P4LLNV8,B0007TFCFW,Kenaz Filan,False,"Symphonic rock has come to mean ""bombastic, overblown, wanna-be Wagnerian music, complete with flashpots and Spandex.""  With ""Thick as a Brick,"" Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson created a true symphony; he started out with an opening theme, then worked variations on that theme for over 40 minutes before returning to that theme for the finale. Most heavy metal music is, in the end, a rewrite of ""Ride of the Valkyries.""  Anderson took his cue here not from Wagner and Beethoven (the original masters of the power chord) but from English composers like Ralph Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar.  Working in snippets from English folk music and jazzy improvisations, he never went for the overblown Big Flourish but kept a properly British Stiff Upper Lip.  (They also retained a distinctively British sense of humor, complete with faux review and lyrics by a ""child prodigy""). Backing him at this time was the strongest Tull lineup: John Evan on keyboards, Martin Barre (one of rock's most underrated axemen) on guitar, Barriemore Barlow on Drums and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond on bass.  Throughout this release they are playing at top form... which, for them, was singularly impressive.  Jimmy Page may have slagged them as ""Jethro Dull"" ... but at their heights Tull was one of the most creative and interesting bands on the progressive rock scene. If you're new to Tull, or to progressive rock, this is a great place to start.  Melodic enough to be accessible, weird enough to be interesting, it manages to be powerful without being pompous.

Lewis said when reflecting on when he first encountered the Delphic Oracle:  It was almost by believing in the gods that I came to believe in God.  Whatever.  What makes this disc so interesting is that it neatly bridges two phases in Garbarek's musical pilgrimage: his pretty constant interest in ritualized musics (he has always played Jim Pepper's great theme, ""Witchi Tai To,"" in his concerts) and his movement toward stylized world jazz that reaches its apex, perhaps, on his latest disc (as of this writing), In Praise of Dreams.  If this disc is a little messy, in that the artist seems to be probing and grasping for his next musical phase, incorporating lots of different rhythmic and cultural sensibilities, it is never less than interesting, and often compelling.  If everything doesn't work optimally, that's as much because of its experimental nature as of it's imperfectly realized and, it must be admitted, somewhat inchoate aesthetic.  Definitely worth acquiring, especially if you can get it at a discount.",5,"12 20, 2004",Very interestingly situated in the vast Garbarek canon,1103500800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},11.0,,record pan play much sensibility apex artist work somewhat witchi aesthetic pilgrimage come theme neatly say jim admit imperfectly disc cultural interest write world rhythmic think toward hilliard next lot realize get want encountered nature concert experimental god lewis tai seem inchoate phase definitely great christian we're different musical must discount less pagan entitle music ok interest safe garbarek's write little god that's messy movement probe whatever pepper's right christian stylize rite reach believe worth talk first line number almost oracle grasp music bet perhaps especially rite mostly dreams reflect everything phase bridge late earn even ritualize delphic incorporate acquire jan constant tip never believe garbarek two often record along optimally sacred make previously jazz ensemble always compel praise pretty

1425,212789,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B000002L7G,L.A. Scene,False,"During the 1985 Live Aid concert, Dire Straits' live performances of ""Money for Nothing"" and ""Sultans of Swing"" would become one of the highlights of the Live Aid Concert.  It was also the momentum from Live Aid that propelled ""Money For Nothing"" to #1 song status.  It was the success of this song that would also launch 1985's ""Brothers in Arms"" to #1 album status.  Throughout their career, Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the ""British Invasion"" that was taking place.  In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.  ""Brothers in Arms"" would utilize this unique blend of genres that has been a staple of their musical careers.  Not only would ""Brothers in Arms"" become a huge commercial success - it would also be a high quality effort.  For the most part, Dire Straits is the brainchild of its lead guitarist and vocalist - Mark Knopfler.  Throughout his career, Knopfler would assemble a group of musicians that would comprise Dire Straits.  While the only constant besides Knopfler has been Bassist John Illsley,  Knopfler would succeed at bringing in high quality musicians to support the unique blend of music he would write.  Knopfler is widely considered one of music's legendary guitarists.  While ""Brothers in Arms"" showcases why Knopfler is worthy of this honor, there are also many high quality instrumentation efforts by the other members of the band.  In addition to an album that is well written from both and musical and lyrical standpoint, it is going to be the great performances by Dire Straits as a whole that is going to make this a very special album.  ""Brothers in Arms"" is also a famous album because it was one of the first albums to be released in an ""all digital format"".  Back in 1985, ""Brothers in Arms"" was one of the best sounding albums around from a recording standpoint.  Now, add the fact that ""Brothers in Arms"" has been remastered and you really hear the difference.  The music on this collection is going to reflect this quality - having an almost ""three dimensional effect"".  While ""Money for Nothing"" is probably the band's best-known song, there are many other tracks on this album.  While one can make the argument that ""Brothers in Arms"" shows a lack of contuinity from a musical standpoint,  Dire Straits gives ""A1"" performances on just about every track.  What the album lacks in musical continuity, it makes up for in musical depth.  Here is a track by track review.  ""So Far Away"":  When this song was played on the radio, it didn't blow me away.  Listening to this remastered version gives me a new appreciation.  Here is a song where Knopfler is not the star - John Islley provides some terrific Bass work (especially the opener) while Guy Fletcher and Alan Clark provide some terrific Keyboard work.  ""Money For Nothing"":  This is the legendary song co-written and co-performed by Sting.  This is the full version of the song - not the badly butchered radio-edit that was heard on radio (and unfortunately was included on the Dire Straits compilation ""Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits"").  Several factors are going to highlight this very complete song:  The unique blend of vocals between Knopfler and Sting; the legendary guitar work by Knopfler;  some outstanding drum work (particularly right before Knopfler's legendary guitar solo), and of course, the humorous lyrics from the standpoint of two blue-collar workers making fun of Rock Stars (this song seems to have stood the test of time).  ""Walk of Life"":  This is the one ""pop"" song on the album.  Many criticize this song because of the use of the electric organ, but I think it blends well with Knopfler's guitar chords.  While it isn't the best track on the collection, it does provide a bit of a retro sound and show Dire Straits' versatility.  ""Your Latest Trick"":  This has become a legendary song by Dire Straits.  Knopfler's guitar won't be the star here.  The horn work is going to really distinguish this song - combined with Knopfler's vocals of course.  It has an R&B feel to open the song.  This is also a well written song as well.  ""Why Worry"": Knopfler's guitar work is outstanding - you can almost pick it out note by note.  This is the album's longest track - and well worth the 8+ minutes of music - particularly the instrumental to close this song. This is really good stuff.  ""Ride Across the River"":  This is a very underrated song.  The song opens with a cross of an African and Latin sound.  Knopfler's guitar takes on almost a ""Carlos Santana"" feel in this song.  There are also some clever use of horns in this song.  ""The Man's Too Strong"":  This is a song where Dire Straits show some of the Folk Music influence.  Knopfler's guitar work is again outstanding.  ""One World"":  This is a Bluesy track with a touch of Country.  Nice guitar work by Knopfler and nice Bass work by Illsley.  ""Brothers in Arms"": At first I asked myself how this song ever became the title track for such a great album - I felt it was too ""soft"".  However, the more I listen to it - the more I liked it.  Once again, Knopfler's guitar almost has a ""Carlos Santana"" feel to it.  The song has a bit of a dark side to it when you compare it to the upbeat ""Money for Nothing"" and ""Walk of Life""  The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to it.  Some of the credits are incomplete (namely the horn credits).  Overall, this is not just a great recording, but a great body of work.

Their 2nd album ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"", late '65 gave us more folk-rock tinged music and another #1 in the title track written by Pete Seeger with words used from The Bible, from the book of Ecclesiastes.  McGuinn gave us ""It Won't Be Wrong"", #63, which he took from his own Beefeaters ""Don't Be Long"".  Gene Clark gives us the gentle nugget ""Set You Free This Time"", Dylan's ""Lay Down Your Weary Tune"", a great Byrd take.  Roger added lyrics to ""He Was A Friend Of Mine"", about the assassination of John Kennedy in 1963, nice moving piece.  The spunky Gene Clark tune ""The World Turns All Around Her"", the harmonies are a #1!  The great chestnut ""Satisfied Mind"", their first take on their country sound to come. (recorded on my birthday in 1965, i just turned 5).  Clark again gives another haunter in ""If You're Gone"", listen closely to those harmonies!  They take on Dylan's ""The Times Are A-Changin'"", with whimsy, compare the two, i'll take The Byrds version.  ""Wait And See"", is a spry tune with a bouncy beat, very Beatles here.  Ever since i got this album 35 years ago, i've loved their take of Stephen Foster's ""Oh! Susannah"", a masterpiece, i know some people don't care for it, but it just struck-a-chord with me, the Rickenbacker is totally awesome here and Michael Clarke's sparse drum fills is classic.  On the bonus tracks we get the Gene Clark strutter ""The Day Walk (Never Before)"", great stuff.  Clark's single version of ""She Don't Care About Time"", McGuinn's guitar is again superb.  Their first take on ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", very different than what was on the album, this might be my favorite version.  Their first version of Dylan's ""It's All Over Baby Blue"", (They would use it again on ""The Ballad Of Easy Rider"", in 1969), the record company didn't think it was strong enough for the album, solid and a keeper in my book.  Clark's first version of ""She Don't Care About Time"", beautiful, with a nice harmonica, guitar break, the ending of this version sound like the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend The Night Together"", so this predates that tune by a good 2 years.

Having read some of the reviews of SOLA, I felt like sharing my opinion, though.  To those saying this album is 45 minutes of the band singing about themselves and their ""adventures""... Hello!!!! This album is based on ""The Dirt"", a best-selling biography of the band (biographies tend to focus on the ones they're about). That's hundreds of pages about the band talking about themselves and their ""adventures"". A fast, entertaining read, too. Has anyone bothered to realize that the album is structured to go from them being nobodies (Face Down in the Dirt, What's It Gonna Take) through starting out at the LA club scene (Down At The Whiskey), to getting huge and untouchable (SOLA, MFer of the year, The Animal in Me), to their well-known spat with their record label (Welcome to the Machine), their lifestyle and decline (Just Another Psycho, Chicks=Trouble, This Ain't a Love Song, White Trash Circus) to their current resurgence (Goin' Out Swingin')? Just like the book. Pretty cool concept, if anything.  Anyway, as far as the album goes, I feel most of the songs are great (my favs are SOLA, The Animal In Me, Just Another Psycho, and Goin' Out Swingin').

The music exemplifies what Ingmar Bergman called ""the silence of God"".  The most similar band I can think of is Saviour Machine, which is about to wrap up a four-CD series based on the book of Revelations.  ""Mezzo Forte"" is the middle piece of a trilogy.  ""Pianissimo"" will be choir and orchestra, while ""Fortissimo"" will sound like the Apocalypse with amps.  For now, we get an even mix of doom-metal, choir and The Adelaide Symphony Orchestra.  For added fun, there's also a ""Death Choir"" including Virgin Black's frontman Rowan London.  The lyrics alternate between English and Latin.  C-minor is the dominant key throughout the CD.  From the opening ""Requiem, Kyrie"": ""The hour of parting is at hand / Sorrow ever awaits on joy / And has rendered me to (pieces)"".  Susan Johnson's soprano soars over Rowan London's tenor.  The strings are slow and gorgeous.  Then the choir and drums punch in again on the word ""Requiem"", and my eyes close of their own accord.  Guitarist/co-writer Samantha uses restraint and simple melodies.  (I expect on the third CD, shell knock us flat on our butts.)  Dino Cielo's drums are slow and sparse, in keeping with the orchestration.  There are only seven tracks because most of them are longer than the line at the DMV.  The closing ""Rest Eternal"" is basically a reprise of ""Requiem, Kyrie"", with unsettling strings and abrupt silence.  Virgin Black is making its way onto my pedestal for bands like Faith and The Muse and Led Zeppelin.  The ""Requiem"" series will be as intense and exhausting for the listener as it has been for the band.

Scarillo,False,"I'm going to assume that if you've clicked thru to this product description, you are at least familiar with Lou Reed's ""Berlin"" album, so I'll dispense with a critique of the album itself.  While it was never one of my personal favorites in his catalogue (I favor ""Transformer"", ""The Blue Mask"" and ""New York"" over ""Berlin""'s exceptional bleakness/depressing themes, but that's my own opinion), if ""Berlin"" IS one of YOUR favorites, then you should consider this review to be a five-star rating, and go out and get this DVD immediately.  The reason I say that is that this DVD has not only a good-to-great performance, but the sound quality (in 5.1) has a ton of presence and sounded terrific on my home theater, and is extremely well-produced.  Nice camera work, but the double exposure/projections sometimes rendered it a bit too arty for my tastes (though I `get' what they were going for, since there's a story here, so this was probably never going to be a `straight concert film' esp. with someone like Schnabel directing).  Reed's band this time out is comprised of alumni of his band over the years, including Steve Hunter (wow!), Rob Wasserman, Fernando Saunders, and Antony Hegarty (who takes a nice turn on vocals on ""Candy Says"", which is also performed), Jane Scarpantoni, etc, so the chops are in the house, plus there are horns and a choir (so the songs are completely fleshed out).  As I said before, the sound is excellent - but I would've expected no less from Bob Ezrin and Hal Willner (who have also previously worked with Reed) - excellent mix and you can really hear each instrument in sharp detail, so make sure you play this on a system that's worthy.  Reed and band play ""Berlin"" in its entirety, then add on a couple of songs (""Candy Says"", ""Rock Minuet"" and ""Sweet Jane"") for good measure.  I guess one of the best things I can say about this (aside from everything I've already said) is that it has me reaching for my copy of ""Berlin"" on my shelf, to give it another spin/reconsideration.

1499,1389385,A32VHSK5LPVJKE,B005Q9F83O,Bice,True,"My path to this boxed set was probably not the usual one.  I first heard Bill Nelson's work via a few tracks on a sampler that the Discipline Global Mobile label put out called ""Sometimes God Smiles"".  I liked what I heard there, so when I found a used copy of ""Practically Wired"", I snatched it up and enjoyed it.  Things probably would have ended there, except that about a month ago the randomizer on my MP3 player picked out an obscure 80s pop song called ""Acceleration"" from another compilation CD that I had completely forgotten about.  That song caught my ear, so I checked the artist and - hey, Bill Nelson.  Isn't that the guy...  A good bit of web research later, and I'm looking at the Amazon page for this massive boxed set, The Practice of Everyday Life.  I'm not sure what it was that made me decide to take the plunge - maybe it was that insane cover picture with the rabbit head and the huge cartoon guitar.  For whatever reason, I ordered an import copy and then had to wait a couple weeks for it to wing its way over from the UK to the US.  When it arrived I immediately started listening and trying to digest this massive amount of music.  I've only gotten through the whole set twice (the first few discs three or four times), so maybe my opinions will change with additional listens.  But here's where I stand so far:  Mr. Nelson is amazingly creative, and the sheer amount of music he's recorded and number of different genres he's tackled is nothing short of staggering.  In that regard, he reminds me of another musical hero of mine, Frank Zappa (not that Zappa and Nelson sound very similar - just that they were both very prolific and tried their hands at multiple genres).  On the other hand, you know the old saying about a jack of all trades being a master of none - I wouldn't go that far with Bill Nelson, he's certainly a guitar master, but some of the music on this set comes across as a little half-baked.  For every track that's a gem, there are two or three that are OK but nothing to write home about.  According to the liner notes, most of this music was recorded in Nelson's low-budget home studio with the assumption that it would eventually be re-recorded in a professional studio, but that rarely came to pass.  Those lo-fi origins are occassionally a little distracting, and some of the early material sounds like it was mastered directly from a vinyl album.  But really the sound quality issue is a very minor one, at best.  It's all very listenable.  The Be Bop Deluxe material on the first two CDs appeals to the prog-rock fan in me, especially the stuff towards the end of disc one and beginning of disc two.  He starts to go a little too far in the new wave direction after that though, and by the time it gets to the Red Noise material, I could take it or leave it.  Fortunately, disc three quickly takes complete left turn into keyboard-oriented, atmospheric instrumentals and soundtrack work.  From there the set goes all over the place, from 80s pop to experimental music to sample-laden dancable tracks.  If you don't like what you're hearing at any given moment, just hang out for a few tracks and odds are you'll soon be listening to something completely different.  The influences are all over the place.  I hear David Bowie (both his early glam phase and later pop music), Tangerine Dream, a couple pop songs that sound like Bryan Ferry, hints of Pink Floyd and other progressive rock bands, a little Thomas Dolby on the 80s and 90s material, a bit of ELO here and there, and there's even one track where I swear the guitar part sounds like Joe Walsh.  Yet Nelson manages to take all those influences and create his own sound.  If you're a big Bill Nelson fan, you probably already know whether this set is something you need to buy or not.  But if you're like me, and are just intrigued enough to consider diving in and discovering a new artist, I'd say go for it.  As long as the price tag doesn't put you off, this set is almost guaranteed to contain something you'll like, since it covers nearly every style of rock/pop music from the last 40 years.",4,"04 7, 2014",A new fan is born,1396828800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},2.0,,player go jack sample-laden maybe snatch i've guarantee tackled come half-baked distracting start disc origins cover hear mr rabbit nelson time last forgotten certainly sure ear different later prog-rock note atmospheric song direction path fortunately write really hint bill picture box part turn check try far thomas soon home tangerine dive quickly end couple david bit stuff almost across reminds would dolby hear wave track ago practically amazingly leave listens arrive sound instrumentals enjoy set two record call plunge noise go every guy know randomizer amount rock none like sheer soundtrack practice influence could start accord four liner usual nothing experimental hearing wait musical master stagger long sampler ok minor one page re-recorded new whatever make whole material assumption keyboard-oriented smile first amazon obscure band time buy cd intrigue wired year progressive caught pick mobile appeal moment pas style since wing yet old try though take there's deluxe three manages give he's joe additional week hand artist work head red say song need hero professional create rock/pop enough occassionally i'd pink eventually walsh take change regard big everyday acceleration hand rarely genres find music leave huge nearly little thing god like quality place import similar trade good consider use lo-fi come whether early dream sometimes odds low-budget bowie discover global beginning i'm ferry gem best bop life research say another get look compilation bryan stand track via glam master directly month pop tag way immediately order completely listenable towards something multiple creative prolific already mine hang put floyd that's here's issue discipline digest reason sound twice probably insane price copy number elo cartoon studio listen dancable especially nelson's album disc hey phase uk fan complete even except guitar contain vinyl swear short massive opinion get zappa cover end frank web decide cd label

The ironic part is that ""Classic Rock"" floks who wrote Priest off as another mindless Metal Screaming Band in the 80's may be surprised at how Blues Based the first album really is. Here is a song by song: One For The Road - Awesome Opeing track...""Where would we be without music"" Heavy without being too metallic. This song is trully cool. Rocka Rolla - The title track which to me sounds written for clubs. For those who love to cry ""sell-outs"" you must remember that bands only get signed by having an audience. If your playing to casual pub goers and want to get work, you need songs that have a danceable/listenable riff. Therefore, the song was probably decent live, but sounds a little cheesy in parts on disk. Winter - Awesome Black Sabbathish early metal track. This tune isdefinely heavy and hints at a later direction the band would explore. Another song that must have ripped the rook off live. Deep Freeze - What the hell is this? Its not really a song as much it is noise, which I guess was KK's early attempt at a ""Psychedellic"" solo. Suppossed to bridge the song before and after it, but really sounds like nothing and should have been left of or re-recorded. I almost certainly believe the band would love to have this one back. Winter Retreat - The mellow conclusion to the 3 part epic has decent vocals and feel, but sounds more like an idea then a fcully developed song. Cheater - A great hard-rock riff and lyircs about finding your woman screwin some dude and shooting them both. Kind of like Priest meets Leonard Skynard. Not a bad song, but the band is not as good at ""Southern Rock"" as it is at hard-rock/Metal Never Satisfied - This song rips and may be one of the strongest ever written by the band. I would love to hear an updated version of this song. Heavy but not metallic. Great vocals/cool lyrics/awesome riff. Run of the Mill - This song is cool an unexpected. A very mellow guitar opening with some cool clean guitar blues sounding mellow soloing. The main riff slowly builds and sets in and the vocals are cool and mellow. A song about being an old and not changing to improve your life. then a cool heavy riff after the verse. Good tune. Dying to Meet you - Another song that starts mellow and is epic in its scope. A anti-war song, which every early 70's band had to explore. Its a good song though and to me helps build a direction the band would take later, but with a heavier approach. However, why does Rob sing like he has a stuffed up nose on the slow parts. Trying to hit lows instead of highs again. I bet that They would have re-recorded the vocals on a higher budget Caviar and Meths - Hard to say what this was as apparently it was only a two minute instrumental version of a 10 minute song with lyrics. I guess it was put on to fill up space on the record. Another mistake the band probably got talked into by the producer. Diamonds and Rust - A weaker version of the cover the band put on the Sin After Sin release. Sounds ok, but its not recorded as well as the SAS version. Overall this album stands up surprinsly well considering it has a demo feel and is essentially a representaion of what was probably an awesome live show that got the Band attention and a record contract. It has some mistakes and the drums sound flat in parts, but as a 70's low budget - Blues/Metal Rock record it has enough good moments to sound enjoyable 27 year later. What else can you say!

1508,361361,A3CG7SQ6DA5YOC,B00000I78R,Marc Kloszewski,False,"Just listened to this again today--this is the Association's third album, and it includes the hits ""Windy"" (""Everyone Knows It's..."") and ""Never My Love"", which are great and most  certainly everyone of a certain age knows them by heart.  Despite the  expected datedness of the disc, this is a very unassuming, pleasant listen.  Here the group stretches out a bit, not composing as much for the  harmonies of the whole group as much as they did on their first two  records; there's more unison singing and solo backed up by group.  The only  clunky one, I think, is the opener ""Wasn't It a Bit Like Now (Parallel  '23)"", which goes back and forth between modern rock and music hall  style--must have seemed odd even then (why 1923?). Two really nice Jim  Yester songs: one of his best ballads, ""On a Quiet Night"" (lovely  instrumental coda and fade-out) and the uptempo ""When Love Comes to  Me"".  The music carries the songs that tend toward the overly treacly  or dramatic, such as ""Happiness Is"", which I scoffed at early on,  only to be hooked by the really catchy melody later, and ""Requiem for  the Masses"", unless you really get into bullfight tragedies (plus,  those words: ""Mama, Mama, forget your pies/have faith they won't get  cold"").  There's Brian singing the bluesy ""Reputation"" (I  can see the go-go girls dancing in the cages now), and ""Sometime""  is one of my favorite songs on the album; again, scoff, but I think Ted's  cascading drum fill throughout is really distinctive for the song, and  makes it all the more memorable.

There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm a little annoyed at having to listen to their religious messages. This album would have made a genius ep, if they had left it with only 4 songs: 1) Step Into My Office, Baby  - just plain imaginative and infectious! 2) Dear Catastrophe Waitress - old school B&S.  Really fun! 3) Piazza, New York Catcher - again, old school.  Really sharp lyrics 4) Lord Anthony - so moving I cry whenever I hear it:  ""Tony, you're a bit of a mess/melted Toblerone under your dress/If the kids could see you they would pass you right by/blue mascara running over your eye/when will you realize it doesn't pay to be smarter than teachers, smarter than most boys..."" mmm.  See, that's what they are all about, aside from being wildly catchy, they write lyrics that peer into strange sad places. But really those four are the only ones I like.  The rest either sound like glossy-produced rip-offs of early eighties ultra-pop tunes, or are, as I wrote, strangely religious in the most idiotic way.  Jolly to have Jesus.  That one's ""If You Find Yourself Caught In Love"" and the response: ""say a prayer to the man above/thank him for everything you know, you should thank him for every breath you blow...""  Goodness. I'm sure it'll grow on me a bit more.  And I think for most B&S fans this will be a substantially successful album.

Sylosis cannot be explained very easily, due to their rather unique take and style of Melodic Death Metal that does not sound exactly like any other bands.  However, if comparisons were necessary, Sylosis could be summed up as a mixture between: Epicurean, Mercenary, Sonic Syndicate, Mors Principium Est and Zonaria.  They take the growling styles of Epicurean and Zonaria and mix them with the riffs and tempos of Mercenary, then combine these with the occasional clean singing of Sonic Syndicate, mixed with the speed and guitar solos of Mors Principium Est.  The resulting mixture is a recipe for one of the most enjoyable Melodic Death Metal albums in recent years.  Starting off with their debut release ""Casting Shadows"" back in 2006, the band continues to evolve into a more complex, and unique band with each sequential album.  With their latest release ""Conclusion of an Age"", Sylosis showcases not only their best instrumental work, but also their best song arrangements and vocal styling to date.  Jamie Graham showcases his best vocal performances on the album, utilizing high pitched growls, low guttural grunts, deep screams, and rhythmic and catchy clean singing that suits the song structures and accompaniment beautifully.  Starting off with a heavy hitting track ""After Lifeless Years"", which is slowly introduced by the soft, melodic instrumental work of the track ""Desolate Seas"", the album begins to release its brutality on the listener.  Jamie doesn't hesitate to utilize high pitched growls that are held for several seconds on end, all while guitarists Josh and Alex play some very progressive sounding riffs.  The album continues to mix up clean vocals with death growls throughout its entire play length, yet manages to maintain a balance between the two.  Stand out tracks include ""After Lifeless Years"", ""Reflections Through Fire"", ""Conclusion of an Age"" and ""Withered"".  All of these songs mix up fast tempos, quick double bass patterns, progressive riffs, and harsh vocals.  The solos found on the track ""Withered"" are excellent, mixing the sound of aforementioned bands perfectly, yet managing to sound unique at the same time.  Sylosis' ""Conclusion of an Age"" is one of the best stand out titles in Melodic Death Metal and is amongst one of the most unique albums released recently within the genre.  If you're a fan of bands like Mercenary, Mors Principium Est, Epicurean, Dark Tranquillity, Ensiferum, Skyfire, or other progressive sounding Melodic Death Metal bands, then you're bound to enjoy this album.",5,"11 5, 2010",Extremely Impressive Melodeath Album,1288915200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,shadow bound age mixture performances mixed track hold guttural tranquillity vocal heat reflection title radar taste work complex double genre enjoy zonaria heat-seeking sonic riff scream fire like vocal pitch however hesitate could songs arrangement pattern rhythmic sylosis enjoyable soft high several josh length aforementioned dark due within take withered sure unique song everyone's clean fly alex bass mix deep utilizing date find seas mors mercenary debut one conclusion play ensiferum manage death balance entire pure comparison back growl slowly solos showcase brutality utilize accompaniment growling est recent low lifeless suit speed graham sing quick perfectly desolate style guitarist continue result cannot band melodic time evolve album sequential metal epicurean sum introduced instrumental track skyfire also fan recipe late maintain necessary principium band easily include fast mix year cast release progressive amongst guitar recently sound occasional listener syndicate second release missile grunt albums catchy appear style combine best two yet excellent jamie sound end throughout tempo explain heavy harsh hit exactly style manage structure start begin beautifully rather stand

I was very excited to get this CD after seeing her earthshattering performance of ""Love Reign O'er Me"" on the Kennedy Center Awards TV Broadcast.  However, after several listens to this CD I must confess that I am underwhelmed.  She starts off with the Beatles ""The Word"" and turns it into something completely different from the original--funky, soulful and intense.  But then in song after song after song she tears into the lyrics like a woman unleashed (and that's a good thing), all the while completely obliterating the melodies of these classics.  I'm all for artistic expression, but I don't see the point of replacing some really great tunes with rote, repetitious blues riffing.  Yes, I know she's a blues singer but after a while I felt like I could predict which riffs she would do next.  I mean, ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" has a great melody.  Why erase it?  The same with ""It Don't Come Easy"" and several others.  At least ""Nights In White Satin"" has some resemblance to the original melody.  I'm not saying you have to stick to the exact tune, but you certainly can express your individuality without throwing out the composer's entire melodic line.  I mean Etta James, Aretha and Tina Turner have done it time after time after time.  Don't get me wrong-- each individual song is done well, but after a while they all sounded the same to me.

I realize that I am not perfect, but to whom much is given - much is required.  Would they perform that song with D. Banner if Christ was physically sitting in review...would our Lord approve?  Hearing several reviewers say that the name Jesus is barely mentioned in the album was disheartning.  I respect those who choose to support the work regardless, but I've made the decision not to...please respect that.  I think we must be careful where we plant our seed...and sowing seed in which ANY portion of it will go to David Banner is not good ground ""for me"".  I researched D.

1528,1116615,A2GPY0SUZMLHM5,B0000026LV,Johnny Angel,False,"In late 1988 Udo was ""out"" of Accept pursuing a solo career with his new band U.D.O. (which was similar in style and musicianship to Accept) and ""in"" was American newcomer and powerful singer David Reece.  Udo definetly was an identifiable voice and a steadfast icon when you think of Accept, but Reece on this album showed a very clean, crisp, and downright powerful voice at times emulating such renowned metal screamers as Rob Halford or Manowar's Eric Adams. Different though, was that Reece had an image/style that was borderline ""hair-metalish"" which some people welcomed (he could have just as well fit into a Motley Crue or similar type of band at the time as singer), while more traditional Accept fans didn't like the new singers stlye, despite his more than adequate voice. More surprising than the fresh and welcome change in the vocal department was also a new rhythm guitarist Jim Stacey, who actually played nothing on this release but was the new touring rhythm guitar player. Not much is generally known about Jim or where he played before, or since, this era as he has pretty much disappeared from the scene. He, along with David Reece and Wolf Hoffmann were said to be very accommodating to the fans after shows during this era for the tours with WASP and Metal Church.  First and foremost, the scathing 1 or 2 star reviews here are simply from people who A. Probably never heard the album or any of the other songs beyond 'Generation Clash;, or B. Simply bash for the sake of 'bashing', or un-accepting (no pun intended) that there was a new singer. Anybody who states Reece 'could not sing' clearly needs to see an ENT specialist pronto.  The album overall I would say is' extremely good' and yes, some songs you will get a sense of commercial vibe with a dileberate intent by the Accept camp to try a new change and maybe compete with some of the other heavy rock/hair metal acts ""happening"" at the time, but you WILL know this is trademark Wolf Hoffmann and Peter Baltes behind their respective instruments.  Hands down the best track on the album is 'Mistreated'. Half ballad, half straight up rocker. This really showcases Reece's vocal ability showing intensity yet with soft passion. You can almost envision this as a huge 80's ""balland anthem"", with an arena of people holding their lighters and singing along. However, it was released under the 'Accept' name and ""with a new singer"" - Accept not being historically known for that type of anthem - hence this song and album kinda got lost on the radar. (Just a side note: This was the same year Skid Row released their debut with completely overrated singer Sebastian Bach with completely overrated song ""I remember you"". Compare the albums/songs/musicianship side by side and you'll see who the better band was...)  The first and second tracks are excellent (XTC - great rocker - and the 2nd track, Prisoner, you will sense the commerical sound, as if you could have also envisioned it on the radio in 1989, but it still rocks really hard). I think the clear stand-out tracks aside Mistreated by far are track 5 (D-Train) which is totally killer all-around, and track 10 (Hell Hammer) which showcases how truly powerful and crisp Reece was behind he microphone. Other tremendous tracks include Generation Clash, Chain Reaction, Break The Ice, and Turn the Wheel (which Udo and his band contributed 'crowd vocals' to).  * Note. Some albums have the additional tracks 'Break the Ice' and 'I Can't Believe In You'. Both are excellent tracks in themselves.  The 2-3 filler tracks are okay but nothing to get into a tizzy over, some of the other song titles have a ""prince"" vibe to them but they are still quality metal tracks. For the tracks Ive listed above, this album on those merits alone is worth a buy especially for many of those fans out there who might have really appreciated some of the better hair metal with much beefier songs than say what Poison or Faster Pussycat was doing during that time, but may have not been exposed to this release or that of David Reece.  Overall I would say this is a pretty darn good album. It's not as legendary as ""Restless And Wild"" or ""Balls To The Wall"", but it is better than even some of the stuff they released with UDO in the late 90s. However, this was the sole release with David Reece. The tour with WASP and Metal Church wasn't drawing too well and internal problems within the band led to Reece being dismissed at the beginning of the 90's and Accept going on a few years hiatus.  A few years later David Reece was rumored to have turned down an offer to join Judas Priest for the main reason of not wanting to go into another band as ""a replacement singer"" again -- traditional metal fans especially those who loved the ""metal screamers"" would more than likely I'd think appreciate Reece's work on this LP.  4 out of 5 for this album.

1530,1113593,A1JMR6MVOIC38K,B0000025FF,Charles - Music Lover,False,"This album is distinctive in many ways.  First, it was a brilliant coupling of cover material and original songs.  Baez's original songs (""Honest Lullaby,"" ""For Sasha,"" and ""Michael,"" an ode to her boyfriend and early career) stand out amongst cover material by Jackson Browne, Janis Ian, and the Bellamy Brothers.  Second, it was recorded at Muscle Shoals Studio and produced by Barry Beckett.  Need I say anything about the quality of the musicianiship?  Third, the mix on the vocals highlight Joan's lower register, which is beautiful and earthy and bears little resemblance to the ethereal sounds of Joan's early recordings.  The U.S. CD release included the single-release edited version of the title song, a mistake that always boggled my mind.  I don't know if the import version includes the entire song, but, if not, the original album version is included in Baez's box set collection ""Rare, Live and Classic.""  For ""Honest Lullaby,"" Joan used the theme from the 50s hit ""Little Darlin,"" and I remember seeing her in concert once where she interspersed lyrics from that song in the bridge.  I think the two performance highlights on ""Honest Lullaby"" are the program's final two songs: ""For All We Know"" and ""Free At Last.""  I remember reading somewhere (her autobiography, maybe?) that Joan learned ""For All We Know"" from a Nina Simone album.  Joan contributes a bravura vocal performance with piano accompaniment.  ""Free At Last,"" co-written by Joan, is a gospel-flavored number written about Martin Luther King, Jr., her buddy in the civil rights movement.  The song will have you singing along and playing it again and again.  An amazing recording from an amazing artist.  And the cover photography by Josef Karsh perfectly encapsulates the beautiful music.

1534,392887,A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00002Z7A0,Peter Durward Harris,False,"To coincide with Dolly's European tour of 2007, there were several CD releases including yet another best of compilation and three twofers (of which this is one) featuring six albums, five of which had never been released on CD while the other had only briefly been available in the early days of CD. Three of Dolly's older albums were also released with bonus tracks (of which this is one) although only the bonus tracks were new to CD, the main albums having already been made available on earlier releases.  The basic Jolene album as originally released had ten tracks, all of a high quality.  Two of them became number one country hits for Dolly before eventually becoming internationally famous. The first was the title track, which became a British top ten hit in 1976. Dolly's music has been popular in Britain ever since, and may now be more so than in her homeland, although her popularity isn't reflected in raw chart statistics. Many singers have covered Jolene over the years since, the first major cover being by Olivia Newton-John, who included it on her 1976 album, Come on over.  The other famous song on Dolly's Jolene album is, of course, I will always love you, though it took much longer to achieve international acclaim.  Linda Ronstadt was the first major artist to cover it when she included it on her 1975 album, Prisoner in disguise. Dolly re-recorded the song for her 1982 movie, Best little chicken house in Texas (yes, I know it wasn't a chicken house), whereupon the new version repeated the success of the original by becoming a number one country hit. International success eluded the song until Whitney Houston made it into a worldwide pop hit. Then Dolly had another country hit with the song, this time as a duet with Vince Gill, though it didn't make the top ten. As a footnote, it's worth noting that multi-artist pop compilations featuring the song often include one of Dolly's solo recordings rather than Whitney's version, presumably because of royalty issues.  There was always much more to the original album than the two classics. Eight other great songs include When someone wants to leave (a sad song about a one-sided love), River of happiness (I always loved this upbeat, happy song, though I cannot listen to it now without thinking of Amazon), Highlight of my life, It must be you and Living on memories of you. There are also two outstanding songs that weren't new to Dolly's existing fans, though they were new to me at the time because I was just starting my record collection when I bought this album in 1978; more about those later.  None of the four bonus tracks have ever been released before although one of the songs (Barbara on your mind) should be familiar to Dolly's fans. Dolly later re-recorded the song for her 1982 album Heartbreak express, along with three other songs that she had previously recorded (Release me, Do I ever cross your mind, My blue ridge mountain boy). As originally recorded in 1973 in a style similar to the other album tracks, Barbara on your mind sounds somewhat different from its 1982 re-incarnation. Brilliant as that track is, my favorite among the four bonus tracks is Cracker Jack, a story song about a dog that supposedly had fun with as a child, having discovered him as a homeless stray. I don't know if the story is true or a figment of Dolly's fertile imagination, but it's brilliant either way. The other two songs (Another woman's man, Last night's lovin') are also excellent.  With four tracks of such high quality that could have been included in the original album, one is left to wonder at the decision to leave them out, especially as two of the chosen songs were not new. Lonely coming down first appeared on My favorite songwriter Porter Wagoner, an album released in 1972, less than two years before the song re-appeared on Jolene. Early morning breeze is a little older, having first appeared on the 1971 album Coat of many colors, although Dolly re-recorded it (only slightly differently) for the Jolene album. Well, it doesn't matter now that the expanded album is available. The curious thing is that the liner notes only comment on the original album although the recording details cover the bonus tracks as well.  If you've already got the original album on CD, you may be reluctant to buy the expanded version. If you're a committed Dolly fan as I am, you'll easily by the inclusion of three previously unheard songs and a fourth that is very different (and more countrified) than the hitherto familiar version. Compare that with the re-releases of Coat of many colors (also four bonus tracks but only two previously unheard songs) and My Tennessee mountain home (only one bonus track, Secred memories, available elsewhere on CD, it first appeared on the album Love is like a butterfly, which album still awaits a CD release). If you have all three albums on CD already, the bonus tracks here offer better value than the other two.",5,"05 21, 2009",Outstanding bonus tracks added to great album,1242864000,,,,internationally mountain whereupon think jack hitherto ever newton-john last favorite dolly many thing briefly barbara night's different later note song happy houston singer fun reluctant success original chart river release yes home chicken britain child highlight royalty version imagination repeat outstanding dog woman's comment familiar track become leave hit re-releases include easily release chosen release main either gill upbeat two record without coincide boy previously jolene british may re-incarnation know porter house much elude none recording wagoner like value songwriter could come four liner ronstadt listen title olivia several stray cover color well tour one love re-recorded new acclaim make bonus compare exist appear worth day first amazon fertile ten time raw living top issue buy cd also still brilliant five solo duet year re-appeared whitney album style since yet story though include breeze supposedly basic originally always three elsewhere rather record expand popularity heartbreak feature artist long country become decision true song among secred want countrified eventually multi-artist reflect wonder slightly lonely must fan statistic european eight less although music leave little course offer quality discover commit similar curious take major early mind get ridge classic man buy make texas best compilation often along lovin come vince life well twofers another dolly's compilation cracker unheard track sad express happiness pop hit butterfly somewhat way love figment memory disguise movie someone footnote six differently high note great already tennessee presumably fourth linda prisoner earlier achieve international one-sided record include cross morning popular sound collection inclusion number cannot homeland awaits especially album blue fan coat matter homeless worldwide never whitney's cover excellent detail famous available old start

The songwriting on this disc is mainly about relationships between men and women as ""counterparts"".  Sounds silly, but Neal Peart pulls it off with some of the best lyrics of his career.  I still think ""Cold Fire"" is one of the best relationship songs he has ever written with line after line of great dialogue between the two main characters in the song.  Other highlights include the hit ""Nobody's Hero"", ""Between The Sun And Moon"", ""The Speed Of Love"", ""Double Agent"" with it's weird spoken word section by Geddy, ""Everyday Glory"" and the funky instrumental ""Leave That Thing Alone"".

It is just really cool, good beat, good guitars, good vocals, good solo.  2,)I just want you-A really cool electronic sort of a song, with beautiful lyrics. I like the solo a lot.  3.)Ghost behind my eyes-This is a pretty good slow song. It is a sad sort of a love song.  4.)Thunder Underground-A good rocker. Awesome opening riff. Ozzy's vocals are almost hypnotic. Lyrivs are cool too. They are about a person ozzy doesn't like. It would make a good concept album to do one on the person, but that would be too much like the downward spiral.  5.)See you on the other side-A good song. Not much too say about it.  6.)Tomorrow-This my all time favorite ozzy song. The lyrics are awesome, and the music is cool.

The vocals sound a little nasaly.  8.)My little man-The only song on the album I don't like. The idea is good, but it's just too sappy. He perfected the concept with aimee.  9.)My jekyll doesn't hide-The title at first glance souds clever, but if you think about it, it doesn't work. If jekyll was the bad guy it would.

1571,182141,A3FVFJ8D95E9KY,B000002J1L,K. Bentley,False,"In 1970, after two failed albums,Genesis faced an uncertain future. To add to that, their guitarist Anthony Phillips, and their drummer John Mayhew, had left the band. Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks found two replacements for the departed members in guitarist Steve Hackett, and drummer Phil Collins. This lineup would make some of the most spectacular music ever. Nursery Cryme, recorded and released in 1971, was their first album together. The first song, a 10 minute epic called ""The Musical Box,"" is almost worth the entire album alone. I is probably their heaviest song, and one of the their darkest (musically). The band clicks together, despite sludgy production, with Collins playing drums like a madman, Steve Hackett's amazing guitar solos, and of course, the magnificent vocals of Peter Gabriel, who was an effective vocalist even as an unknown 21 year old. One of the best songs ever. ""Return of the Giant Hogweed"" is another epic, and it's very heavy and apocalyptic, again with Steve Hackett's guitar being a prominent instrument, which it wasn't most of the time when he was in the band, and Tony Banks making some worthy contributions to the song. The piano part starting the end of the song is one of the most beautiful pieces of music he ever wrote. The rest of the album is somewhat ofa letdown, compared to those 2 powerful songs, though songs like those are hard to top. Phil Collins makes his first appearance as a lead vocalist in the brie but pleasant ""For Absent Friends."" ""Seven Stones,"" a song that usually gets slack from a lot of fans, is another rather dark and somber song, and it's a great song. ""Harold the Barrel"" gives insight into their playful and bizarre side, which was more evident on subsequent albums, ""Harlequin"" is a simple acoustic song w/ pretty good vocal harmonies. The last song, ""The Fountain of Salmacis"" is 8 minutes long, but it doesn't strike me as much as it does the other 2 epics on this album.

While this disc is lacking in excitement and emotion, the clarity, expression and balance are top notch. Not everyone will prefer the precision oriented approach of Szell, but I find it to my liking.  One minor gripe though, is that the opening movement has a flubbed note from the trumpet soloist, which does seem out of place in a Szell recording. Szell demanded technical perfection from his players, and had no trouble berating said players, for even minor issues like a flubbed note, so it is interesting he didn't correct that botched note in the opening movement.  Moving on from that minor gripe, I found the Capriccio Espagnol to be oustanding, exceeding the Ormandy / Philadephia version, which I also have.

The title piece, ""The Soft Parade,"" is truly one of the silliest things ever committed to vinyl. With words like: ""Peppermint miniskirts, chocolate candy-- Champion sax and a gur-ull named Sandy,"" the myth of Jim Morrison's supposedly brilliant lyric-writing abilities was laid to rest for all time. You can almost hear Morrison's drunken hiccups during his ad-libbed ""This is the trip"" nonsense on what is an overlong, wincingly putrid musical montage.  His physical damage from drug and alcohol overconsumption and rapid decline were never more apparent than on the vocals for ""Touch Me"" and ""Tell All The People."" The man's lack of sobriety on the first and unsteady weakness on the second are almost painful to experience. ""Wishful Sinful"" and ""Wild Child"" are more of the same.  The only standouts on this one are ""Easy Ride"" and ""Runnin' Blue."" My guess is Jim was sober for those sessions. The rest here is totally forgettable.

After listening to this new album the last four or five days, I must say that I find it their most interesting and enjoyable studio album since 1992's Elecric Tepee. I'm finding more to like about it with each listen and I'm going back and listening to it again and again not just because I think it's my job as a loyal Hawkwind fan to do so, but also (and most importantly) because I WANT to hear some of these songs again!!  On board this time are Dave Brock (of course), drummer Richard Chadwick, returning keyboardist Tim Blake and newbies Nial Hone (guitar, bass, keyboards) and Mr. Dibs (bass, vocals). This album rocks hard in places, like on Wraith, Inner Visions and Prometheus and new guitarist Nial Hone fluid lead guitar lines really add to the music, particularly on the beautiful and melodic guitar/keyboard instrumental Green Machine. I'm not too big on Mr. Dib's singing voice....there are times he sounds a bit too much like Ron Tree for my liking, though he sounds fine on Prometheus. The re-make of You'd Better Believe It is okay, but unnecessary. The other re-make, of Dave Brock's Sweet Obsession, is quite good and one of the album's highlights. Perhaps I like it because I didn't even know it was a remake at first and therefore, never heard the original version. Nonetheless, I like it a bunch and particularly like Brock's singing on it. The ryhthm section is kept quite busy here!  The album doesn't get off to a strong start, but it does end on a pleasant and relaxing note with the instrumental Starshine. Overall, Blood Of The Earth is far from being a perfect Hawkwind album, but it is still a suprisingly enjoyable and interesting album. I'm wondering why these delayed the U.S. release of the album, tho. Three and a half stars.  (P.S. I hate to end this positive review on a negative note, but it is now 7-28-10 and I'm more than a little annoyed that they are offering this album as a download again, but with more songs and they're offering it at the same price!

This is a super album with many great ELO tunes, and it successfully sustains itself for over 70 minutes without once ever lagging. Frontman Jeff Lynne came up with a great wealth of material for this one, including such classics as ""Turn To Stone,"" ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"" and ""Mr. Blue Sky,"" but also such gems as ""It's Over,"" ""Night In The City,"" the light piano funk of ""Starlight,"" the rhythmic ""Jungle,"" ""Standin' In The Rain,"" the beautiful ""Big Wheels,"" the dreamy instrumental ""The Whale,"" and the rockin' ""Burmingham Blues."" The songs are all very catchy, the orchestral flourishes throughout are suitably lush, and the album's production is sparkly (and dig that album cover artwork, especially on the inside). There are those who say that ""Out Of The Blue"" is too over-the-top, i.e. that a double dose of ELO's symphonic pop-rock is a little too much to take. All I can say is this: either you like ELO or you don't. If you DO like ELO, than ""Out Of The Blue"" will fit the bill in your CD collection just fine. It's one of the band's greatest works, and I guarantee you'll love it. (NOTE: there's a tracking error on the ""Out Of The Blue"" CD, as the song ""Standin' In The Rain,"" which should be track 10, has been mistakenly tacked on to the end of track 9, which is ""Steppin' Out,"" so you'll have to cue up ""Steppin' Out"" and fast forward to the 4:39 mark if you want to immediately get to ""Standin' In The Rain.""

All in all, his efforts are pretty good. His voice seems right for the songs, and his use of ""special guest stars"" like Nicole Kidman and Jon Lovitz on tracks makes the album more fun than other pop star throwback efforts, like the recent Rod Stewart album. However, and this is key, Williams' take on the songs is so authentic that he seems to have excised a bit of his usual dark, sarcastic personality for it. It would've been nice to have a bit of that injected into the numbers. There's nothing particularly wrong with this album.

1590,452275,A25GGLE1TSWSBI,B00005LK1Q,K. Enos,False,"Well, that was the original aim of this Record, though the Timing of it was TOTALLY WRONG. How YES could have thought this was a good follow-up idea from ""Yessongs"" just goes to show what happens when you quit hallucinogenics cold-turkey, and become a Vegetarian ! ""Eeeew!"" YES were on the cusp of becoming the BIGGEST Act in Rock History, when they shot themselves in the foot with this one !  The General Idea was to write The Bible/Man's History/Past/Present/Future, put to Music... all rolled into one Grand 4-Movement Rock Opus.  OK, when you take it from that perspective.... .....IF you forgive them for not putting out the Face-Melting Album everyone was anticipating at the Time.... ....IF you just SET ASIDE all your pre-conceived notions and ultimatums.... .....IF you just smoke a wee bit 'O Bunji Bud.....RELAX....put on headphones.... ....close your eyes....MEDITATE....and JUST LISTEN.......... The Music on this LP begins to Paint pictures in your Mind's Eye that are SO VIVID, you can damn near have an Out-of-Body Experience, and transcend & transport to Worlds of Seascapes, Sunsets, Forests, Mountains, Nebulae in Space, different planets, different Times. After so many listens, I am convinced you can achieve Communion with God Himself.  My Blind, shallow-minded Little Teenage Sheeple that dis this record on the 1st listen.....THAT is the POINT !  You either GET this Album, or you DON'T !  There's never been any in between.  I learned many Lessons from YES, and this LP in particular, about REPEATED LISTENINGS to Music that confused and confounded you at 1st listen.  I learned that some of the most REWARDING & PHENOMENAL Music, is just like that. It needs Time to Grow in your Soul, Mind, & Memory; as a Plant needs each New Day to mature and become a fruit-bearing Tree; which is oddly enough in direct correlation to the Human Religious Experience. On some levels, YES actually achieved what they were trying to prove here.  Being a Musician Myself... I also learned many Lessons about writing Music, Creativity, Themes, Storytelling, Composition, and Fearlessness and Adventure with your Art and your Spirit as an Artist. I have learned over the Years, to PLAY this entire album, and let me tell ya :  It Aint no Cakewalk ! The Guitar Solo on 'The Ancient' is like a Demon cackling at you, because you cannot Humanly reproduce it ! It's quite an exercise in each of the 5 instruments : be it Drums, Bass, Keys, Vocals, or Guitar. Tales is like an old friend, and still astoundingly Original and to this Day, way ahead of its Time- -yet...ANCIENT, in some strange way. This is what Blossoms, or USE to Blossom...when true Artists were allowed to be FREE of 'Rules', and the shackles of ""Commerciality"". I dare ye ta use that dirty word in front of Robert Fripp; he'll punch ya in the Eye ! King Crimson's ""LIZARD"" was an acquired taste much like this LP. But once you got used to the Music, you friggin' LOVED it !  I remember that once I had acquired the Taste for this record; I had a weird feeling or sense that this Music always existed somewhere out in Space for all Eternity. YES simply heard it playing in the Clouds, and plucked it from the Heavens, as if they were some sort of Conduit to deliver it from The Gods unto Mankind here on Earth. Some Music has that Timeless, Eternal Quality,  and many of the chord structures & harmonies on this record make you feel that way.  OK, so it wasn't the KICK-ASS Rocker we were all hoping for after YESSONGS, but...for the expansion of the Mind & Soul, Fun Musical Ride, Gorgeous Timeless Masterpiece this album is, it is an absolute MUST-HAVE Treasure for True Fans of Beautiful and Powerful Music, no matter what 'Genre' . It does NOT have to be what we call 'Rock & Roll', in order to Move You and Groove You. Besides....after this came 'Relayer' (Daaaaamn !)-so YES more than apologized later on :)    This record taught me that ALL MUSIC is Wonderful, because it is the Universal Language of God & Nature, (wrap your mind around THAT one ! )--and has the potential to create PEACE in the World,  and Harmony in The Universe, and can probably do so many things we puny little Humans cannot even imagine yet. You do know that a Sound Wave can DESTROY a Planet, right ?! If I met a Space Alien, I could not talk to him, yet I could convey a proper message and emotion with Music. I dunno, it's very hard to put into Words. YES-Music for Me has always been full of realizations and surprises like that.  If it had not been for 'Tales', I may never have been open-minded enough to turn onto diverse music such as Indigo Girls, Stereolab, Varttina, Cocteau Twins, The Residents, SIA, Flower Kings, etc, etc.  'Tales' is an ICON of an album. And I Thank God He made me one of those Souls who ""Gets It"" ! When I met Chris Squire, I told him not to be so hard on themselves for doing this album, because the True YES-Heads consider it one of our Favorites !  Later on when I discovered GENESIS, I thought it was REALLY UNCANNY that they made ""The Lamb"" at the same Time YES made ""Tales"" !

I love the instrumentation as much as I do the arrangements. Richards was determined to include mellophones in the arrangement, which is also heavy with trumpets. This worked out beautifully in the performance of the arrangements, and the lower register mellophone fit in beautifully with the other lower register instruments which make up the bulk of the ensemble. In fact, the majority of the instrumentation is bottom end types, including bass and baritone saxophones, trombones and a tuba (to name but a few). Even the percussion section contains tympani.  Listen to the sound samples on this page for a gauge of the music itself. In fact, if you compare this album to the original film sound track,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Side-Story-1961-Film-Soundtrack/dp/B0000027WF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Side Story (1961 Film Soundtrack)</a>, you will immediately notice that Richards left out any woodwind instruments that Bernstein and Sondheim included (although there is a relatively large reed section.)  Another thing I love is this album swings. The original score was ideal for adapting to jazz and swing style music, and Richards' arrangement (and Kenton's conducting and ensemble) pulled it off perfectly. That is the main reason why I claimed that this is the definitive interpretation in the title.  One final note: If you play (or love) trumpet, Conte Candoli's solos shine. Since most of the instrumentation is in lower registers Candoli's solos practically float on top of the music. If you are a musician, composer or arranger there is a goldmine of ideas on this album.

1596,1273584,A2RCJ1HUX9B84E,B0000AN4FI,Yoselovich Boris,False,"I listened to quite a few Peteris Vasks CDs and there is always a second-hand feeling about his music - this has been made many times before,but much better (D.Schostakovich and H.Gorecki, for example).It is always very dramatic,it is always about human suffering,it always aims at universal appeal and there is that moment where a sort of catharsis is supposed to be at some high point towards the end of the piece...but there isn't any. Sentimental dramatism kills it. The same can be said about this Quartet No. 4. Is Mr. Vasks really constantly suffering so deeply about universal problems of humanity worldwide(""bloodshed and destruction vs love's power and idealism that keep the world in balance"" as he puts it himself in his notes for the CD)?

I think Crow could stand to get out of this rut of all the albums sounding exactly the same, but there is nothing wrong with her sound. I like the songs here, for the most part, and don't think that a person should be penalized for consistently making quality music, even if it does not sound markedly different than his or her previous recordings. Nevertheless, I can only defend so much. I am not sure why Sheryl Crow decided to cover Guns 'N' Roses' ""Sweet Child O'Mine"" and would venture to say that Sheryl Crow was happy with the results. But I think it was a big mistake personally. She does not have the voice or personality to pull it off. Besides the fact that there is no point messing with a song that was perfect the way it was. The version of this album that I thankfully bought does not have the dismal remake on it... but when I returned from my European travels last summer, having been inundated with the Crow version on radios throughout the Continent, I was horrified to discover the late inclusion of the remake on Crow's album. Yuck. That's all I can say! Otherwise, Crow offers some solid songs here.

1602,692836,ALND45MWBGUQS,B000OHZJL4,Lunar Boulevard,False,"By 1979 Elvis Costello and the Attractions had proven themselves to be one of the best and brightest acts to come out of the English music scene. Elvis Costello had shown over the course of three very different and distinct albums that he was nothing short of a songwriting genius. After the pop success of Armed Forces it seemed that everyone, including his label, was expecting a repeat with a similar sound and style. Elvis wasn't about to be put in a box and it all came to head in April of 1979 when, during a drunken argument in a bar, Costello uttered a racial slur that gained him a fair amount of backlash and suspicion. Costello has apologized on more than one occasion and has proven over the years that he's anything but a racist. Still, the damage was done and Elvis fought his way out of it through his music. Get Happy!!, released in 1980, is one of his most ambitious and exciting efforts. It's a mile-a-minute thrill ride through Motown and R&B stylings that no one could have seen coming.  Elvis and the band went even further by cramming a stunning 20 songs on this record, clocking in at only 48 minutes. Most artists are lucky to produce a great album with half that many and yet Costello doesn't waste a minute here. ""Love for Tender"" opens the record with some upbeat organ and a fast-paced beat that immediately lets you know that Elvis is exploring the world of funk, R&B, Motown, and soul. ""Opportunity"" rides a classic Motown beat and gives every member of the group a chance to really shine. In fact, while The Attractions are in fine form, it's really bassist Bruce Thomas who dominates here. His funky basslines and sense of urgency keep every song flowing smoothly while unconsciously causing you to tap your foot. The quick-paced vibe of songs like ""High Fidelity"" and ""Human Touch"" are perfect examples of the sound Costello was going for, while slower numbers like ""New Amsterdam"" and ""Secondary Modern"" hit just as hard but in a different sort way. Even a cover of ""I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down"" went on to become a hit, proof that Elvis could take someone else's song and make it his own.  Lyrically the album is great but that's not surprising because Elvis is always in fine lyrical form. The man can write, tell a story, and play with words like a walking dictionary. A special nod goes to my personal favorite, ""Temptation"". The entire song beautifully sums up the album in terms of lyrics and music. Bruce's bassline is incredible, Pete Thomas' drums hit you right from the beginning and the subtle keyboards of Steve Nieve leave a haunting effect in the background. It's truly one of Costello's best songs and the soul-sound of it is so infectious that you'll be humming it for hours. On a record full of stellar tunes this one really drives the whole thing home.  Get Happy!! is an experience unlike any other in EC's catalogue. It rushes by at a lightning pace and yet loses none of the charm and sophistication of his previous offerings. With 20 songs there's no shortage of great material here and Costello's foray into the world of Motown and soul is nothing short of magnificent. Even the title itself is a reference to the gospel music that obviously plays a large part on this release. It's perfect from beginning to end and has more than stood the test of time.",5,"11 17, 2013",You Can Read Me the Riot Act,1384646400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,proof argument r&b go force offering come flow racist fine subtle get lyrically favorite many thing april different song happy seem attraction write really uttered part beat tell foray success right thomas home slow let explore stood leave hit band release apologize sound dominate nod release experience songwriting upbeat special costello's drive temptation expect do elvis every ec's know lyric stellar hard soul ride amount arm none act dictionary open lose like else's tap pace could come shine fidelity title everyone backlash charm group can't nothing modern bright nieve costello genius drunken see one show love new term whole lyrical material haunt give english become effect time mile-a-minute damage amsterdam still organ year human bruce's sophistication incredible scene album style keyboard yet classic story include there's bassline always three personal he's pete head humming hour songs half opportunity member take gospel obviously go box unconsciously music play course gain entire waste number sense similar vibe stun occasion shortage background produce motown artist distinct form tender man urgency make begin suspicion lightning word best slur come previous secondary sum bruce rush catalogue stand drum soul-sound funk smoothly infectious cause pop chance foot way example steve immediately someone world perfect ride quick-paced lucky fall racial high great test bar minute basslines thrill surprise unlike put record tune that's fact play touch fought walk clock stylings go large truly cram minute effort full sort excite album fair fast-paced magnificent proven even reference ambitious short funky cover bassist end repeat label anything keep beautifully

It does a great job of it, too, by offering up a few songs that most Beach Boys fans have probably heard --- like ""Come Go With Me,"" ""Getcha Back,"" and ""Rock And Roll Music"" (though that one's in  a different mix from the familiar one) --- as well as a lot of songs that many of them may not have heard, especially if they're more familiar with the group's '60s material.

Michael Hedges was easily the most exciting and entertaining performer in the Windham Hill stable.  I saw him a couple of times, once on  Halloween.  He came out in a wig, pumps and miniskirt. For those who are  new to his music, he is an acoustic guitarist.  But, that's something of a  misnomer, as his ""acoustic"" instrument is miked-up, flanged, and  reverbed enough to swallow the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  His axe probably  has more electronics in it than Jimi's Strat did.  His songs featured him  using both hands to play double lead lines, or fast and furious strumming,  or swooping portamentoes, or smacking the guitar's body with his ring.  Usually a combination of these.  He wrung more tenderness, power, good  cheer, and even majesty out of this instrument than anyone else I ever  heard, thanks to the electronics AND his talent. His originals here,  other than the novelty ""Funky Avocado"", are rather stately  ballads or tone poems.  Of the latter, ""Breakfast in the Fields""  is a standout.  At one of his concerts, he took a couple of minutes to  explain how this tune came to him from his studies of Bartok.  It's too bad  ""Rickover's Dream"" is not included here, though.

That being said, O:M II is their best work since Empire/Promised Land.  Queensryche lost their way after the release of Promised Land and have being wander the wastelands of generic prog/rock for over a decade.  O:M II puts them back on track.  While this album will never be a commercial success (what non nu-metal/pop/hip hop album can these days?) but it does satisfy the needs of Queensryche's fans.  The sound is very progressive and complex.  Geoff Tate sounds the best has has in many years.  The story isn't a crafted as O:M, but it's still interesting and there are some great track on this CD...including Dio singing the part of Dr. X.  That alone adds 1 star to the rating.  =)  Granted, it took me several listens to get into it...but so did the original back in 1988.

I've known of trumpeter Blanchard for some time now and have been aware of his well-established working partnership with filmmaker Spike Lee but it wasn't until I heard his score for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000EMGAIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)</a>, that I actually began to sit up and take notice. Then the Lee documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-the-Levees-Broke/dp/B000J10F14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When the Levees Broke</a>&nbsp;came out and I remember wishing when I reviewed the DVD that the music from the documentary would be released on CD. Blanchard's work on it is truly amazing.  Well, we haven't got that exactly but we've got the next best thing and probably the nearest thing to it we'll ever get. I'm on vacation in northern California at the moment so I can't be 100% certain but I think three or four of the songs here are from the documentary (or revised and/or expanded versions of them) and all the others are definitely inspired by it. In the inner-sleeve notes, Blanchard walks us through various scenes in the documentary and explains how these inspired the various pieces of music. Others are inspired by the effect the disaster has had on Blanchard's own life, the lives of the people he loves and indeed, the life of his home city.  It's an incredible set. He's joined by Brice Winston, particularly impressive on tenor & soprano saxophones, Aaron Parks (who is also tremendously impressive here) on piano, Derrick Hodge on acoustic and electric basses, Kendrick Scott on drums & percussion and Zach Harmon on tabla & the happy apple - whatever THAT is. Kudos to the band as a whole though; they are as talented, tight and expressive as ever. But there's even more: they are joined by The Northwest Sinfonia, conducted by Blanchard; contractor and concertmaster, Simon James.  The New Orleans tragedy is still ongoing by all accounts and this must be incredibly painful for the people who live in the city and love it as much as Blanchard obviously does. The emotions he freely shares with the listener, I find mournful, plaintive and yet hopeful (though that last one might just be me projecting). Listening to this CD is a strange experience but not an unpleasant one by any means, though I was moved to tears more than once. I've been to The Big Easy twice myself and have fond memories of the place but I haven't been back since Katrina. A debate is ongoing in my head on that subject.  But back to the music. This is undoubtedly one of the most rewarding CDs I've bought this month and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Jazz trumpet and strings - what's not to like? If you're already a fan of Blanchard's music of course this one's a no-brainer. But if you like the string-backed stuff by people like Chris Botti or Roy Hargove, while they're cool and all, this one's on a completely different level. The references to Miles Davis aren't misplaced either in my view. I truly believe this is the kind of music Miles would be making today, if he was still with us. Try putting this one on in the dead of night while the city around you sleeps. It will take you places, I guarantee it. The seventy-two and a half minutes or so will have flown by before you've realised it.

1634,1038113,A3AU6DPY28RYQV,B00NPDVTOK,Mike H.,False,"To start off, there are some excellent songs in Calvin's 4th album. Songs like ""Outside"" with the ever popular Ellie Goulding and ""Blame"" with newcomer John Newman are just outstanding. They get stuck in your head with their catchy lyrics and unique melodies with Calvin's ever growing sound, which still surprises me even though this is his fourth album. Even though the album has these great ""pop house"" songs, Calvin still provides some music that is different from the common electronic cookie cutter.  Songs like ""Love Now"" with All About She and ""Ecstasy"" with Hurts just puts you in a relaxing mood and he plays around with the old-skool acid synth in ""Slow Acid"" that just makes you bob your head. I enjoyed to hear Calvin singing again in ""Summer"" and ""Faith"", which both songs are excellent also in their own ways. But songs like ""Open Wide"" (a.k.a ""C.U.B.A."") with Big Sean and ""Dollar Songs"" with Tinashe feel out of place. They are pretty interesting songs and props for Calvin for exploring, but would be better off as standalone singles.  Of course there are some songs that are a part of the electronic cookie cutter that found their way on the album. Collaborations with Firebeatz, Ummet Ozcan, and R3hab give us such songs with the standard electro/progressive house we hear in EDM festivals. We do hear some Calvin influences in the songs, but they just get drowned out when it goes into a standard kick and snare beat with an overused bigroom or electro synth and melody. They are not bad and are listenable, but they will not be staying on my iPod. They are just lack lustered compared to the Dillon Francis and Nicky Romero collaborations from 18 Months (2012).

1635,1128204,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000002H3Y,Andre S. Grindle,False,"Considering the success of his first two albums it would've been all too easy for Howard to become as complacent as lot of other singer/songwriter/musician's believing they've reached their creative peak. But he didn't. Now on his third release he decided the best way to progress creatively was to approach his music more from a songwriter/musicians approach than a pop artist. Well he'd always rather done that anyway. But here it really takes more of a full flower. For starters this isn't possessed of some of the chillier and even lightly industrial elements you'd find on the album tracks on either&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-s-Lib/dp/B000002H23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human's Lib</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Into-Action/dp/B000002H2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Into Action</a>. Instead everything is devoted more to song construction. It's not to say this album abandons any of his synthesizer/electronic elements. If anything,he actually beefed them up quite a bit. He only used them in a more complex manner on this album.    ""You Know I Love You...Don't You"" is actually a little rockier than usual,with a little guitar which isn't typical for this artist. ""The Balance Of Love (Give And Take)"" is one of those not-so-simple love songs that again balances kind of an 80's synth funk groove with a heavy pop sound. ""All I Want"" and the more horn packed and joyous ""Step Into These Shoes"" continue on a similar sort of upbeat electro funk-pop vein. On the slower,somewhat soul inflected ""Where Are We Going"" and the more electro hip-hop flavored ""Don't Want To Fight Anymore"" both come to terms with his first use of heavy sequencer/Fairlight computer style breaks and such. And he uses them in a very expressive and non gimmicky manner as well too. This shows up a bit too on the slower,funkier,lightly gospel infused ""Give Me Strengh"" as well. ""Little Bit Of Snow"" is a slower and more acoustic piano based song. That being said also bested by it's poetic,humanistic and very non preachy anti cocaine message. The album ends with the ""remix"" of ""No One Is To Blame"" from the previous album that became a hit for him.    Overall this is an excellent record that works more as an album than a collection of excellent and singular songs. Howard always tended to be more of an album artist than a singles one in as much some of his best songs didn't actually become hits. Most of the songs on this album are of a romantic nature. Luckily Howard comes at his music from a rather mature sense to begin with. So these aren't songs about adolescent love affairs and infatuations. They are more poetic and emotionally charged expressions of adult relationships. Because soul and funk elements had become an important part of his music in particular with his previous album that more adult outlook on romance was going to be part of the picture however you'd cut it. Overall this is a mildly different type of Howard Jones album-one that possess more of a flow to it without some of the colder electronic type numbers on his first two albums. But at just the right time when he should've made a slight change to his music,he did.

1637,317247,A3K197FMG9JYGV,B000006RHO,IAF_67,False,"When my friend recommended Iron Maiden to me, I was a little skeptical. For some reason I had viewed Iron Maiden, before actually listening to it, as some sort of death metal band. Maybe I envisioned that because they like to put zombies/demons/whatever on the front of their albums. This was a case where I definitely made a mistake in judging the CD by its cover. When I first listened to it, I wasn't that impressed. Sure, I liked the beginning of ""Still Life"", but after the first 2:44 it went downhill...or so I thought at the time. In truth, I just didn't listen to it enough to really appreciate the amazing guitar work. However, I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of Bruce Dickinson's vocals...it's not that they don't sound well with the music, it's just that I don't like that high pitched type voice (you see, I'm used to listening to James Hetfield of Metallica). Nevertheless, I didn't feel that not liking the vocals affected my enjoyment of this CD too much. There were several songs where I DID enjoy the lyrics as well as the guitar work. I'd have to say that my favorite song on this CD is ""To Tame A Land"". It really demonstrates the right way to have a song over seven minutes that is interesting the entire time. The guitar work in that song is so varied that you often times forget you're still on the same song. I made that mistake the first few times I was listening to the song...I started falling asleep and then woke and thought that the CD started over again, but then I realized my CD player doesn't do that, and I was like, ""What the...?"", and then it dawned on me that I was still listening to the same song. It really is that varied. Another of my favorites was ""Flight of the Icarus"". This was one of the few songs on this CD where I thought the vocals were absolutely astounding. I love midway through the song, when the lyrics start, ""Just a babe in a black abyss/No reason for a place like this"". That may be the best part of any song on the entire CD. There were, however, a few songs I didn't care for. Number one on that list was ""Quest for Fire"". How can you take any song seriously that starts off with ""In a time when dinosaurs walked the Earth""? I like songs that actually mean something to me, or can express in song what I feel emotionally. I don't think there is an emotion that would correspond with that. The other song I didn't care for was ""Sun and Steel"". There really wasn't any one reason that I would pinpoint for not liking that song, it just didn't appeal to me. Maybe it's because, again, I couldn't really relate with things like ""You killed your first man at 13"", etc. It might also have been because I don't like hearing two or three voices singing at once, to me that sounds like I'm at my sisters middle school chorus concert, espcially when they are as high pitched as those in this band. Overall though, I really liked this CD. It was definitely worth my money, and it also gave me something new to listen to now that I've heard every Metallica album. The friend that recommended this to me said he thought it was their best album. I can't be the judge of that since this is the only one that I've heard, but I can honestly say that this is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time, and I'm definitely going to be purchasing more Iron Maiden in the near future!",5,"11 29, 2003",Excellent!,1070064000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,player mistake seven lyric express black judge much envision maybe i've think work enjoy way fire emotionally like vocal emotion say pitch however earth start song start near hear actually might think enjoyment listen time realize can't impress fall high several favorite correspond enough i'd hearing voice take recommend definitely sure big something view amazing minute feel song steel iron money go song...i middle long purchase music interesting dawn put little thing really judge affect one death like woke entire love part new future appeal make midway place right dickinson's dinosaur asleep reason favorite go seriously sound james type singing use worth varied list first downhill...or number honestly abyss/no listen school time tame sort pinpoint flight metallica icarus would album metal friend zombies/demons/whatever truth etc cd also fan sun still demonstrate voice see start band hetfield front quest guitar man listen sound walk case vocals...it's nevertheless albums astound appreciate begin maiden i'm like since forget best two chorus often overall concert mean cover though life babe relate kill sister espcially well say another three skeptical land may bruce every absolutely care give

The band is driving hard on most tunes, yet can be remarkably delicate and complex as well. The melodies are fantastic, the vocals are superb, and the spirit is pure punk. Justine's confessionals are something to behold, as she lets us know what a sex kitten she can be with her back flat on a warm bonnet; or just how devoted a lover she can be in Blue. We find out that she's a game goer in Vaseline, always ready to notch another one even when Nature won't cooperate. In Stutter, we get the full blast of Grrrlish sexuality--all hunger and willingness, but with a biting edge when John Thomas wilts under pressure.  In that case, Annie is always available.... Anything to stave off the mood-crash and the inevitable hangover...Could it be any more Rock 'n Roll?

1639,61661,A2O8XMNIBHZXCE,B000001G8B,"Joseph Kline PhD, MD",True,"In a critically acclaimed recording of Tchaikovsky Symphonies No. 4, 5, and 6, Evgeny Mravinsky leads the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra in one of the finest sets of Tchaikovsky performances to date.  What strikes me first with these performances is their immediacy.  Mravinsky generally favors the intensity of the music such that the emotional elements are expressed without becoming completely manic.  The final effect is a set of emotionally-driven performances.  The 6th symphony is a virtual repository of emotion, but I find Mravinsky a bit emotionally reticent in the slower, more lyrical sections.  He seems at his best with strong, fierce emotion.  A word about sound.  It's great.  DGG back at the time of these recordings always seemed to have a thinnish quality to violins.  I sometimes hear a bit of that in the present disc, but after all, these are 50 years old.  They are always going to sound a little like their age.  Soundstage is appropriately deep and extends laterally slightly beyond the loudspeakers.  I almost always wish that tympani were better defined.  My listening room is very well treated but this could still be an acoustic effect of the room.  These are thrilling performances and a source of joy for the listener.

Released in 2000, Caipirissima featured a few acts and artists that perhaps weren't as main stream as they are now plying their trade in the Brazil and global undergound.  This CD breaks down the boundaries, intensifies the beats and says ""anything goes - including you"".  You can feel the freedom in this cd as nothing is really ruled too radical, no beat too hard.  Starting out with Joao Parahyba (Trio Mocoto)'s ""Central Do Brasil"", you know you're going on a journey through Brazil... not Germany or Holland trying to re-invent the sound.  That track will remind you of Sao Paulo Confessions - and it should given the time frame and that Parahyba and Suba were very very close.  DJ Dolores is next with ""Monica No Samba"", a slower beat with touches of guitar.  Arto Lindsay comes in with ""Whirlwind"", a song that evokes a misty atmosphere over the sea.  And what's an electric Samba cd without perhaps the biggest and best - Ninja-Tune's Amon Tobim.  He comes in with ""Sub Tropic"", a track loaded with eerie effects that'll remind you of an old record player that somehow comes to life in the middle of an Amazon excursion.  Tobim always knew how to add that touch of live instruments to give the music another life, in this case a faded out sax deep in the background.  Suba does feature in a track featuring M.A.U. - neat effects, fast paced, intense.  But perhaps one of my favorite tracks on the cd is well known & respected DJ Apollo 9 with ""Nao Fique Ai"".  It's extremely raw!  But the way the track starts out... imagine Maracana on a rainy day, Vasco vs Flamengo.  Dark, you know something will happen, and then that voice in the background that haunts the track - it's Andrea Marquee.  It's got a sort of soul in the beat, hip-movin' track and weird flute touch.  I definitely recommend this cd but be forewarned that this will NOT be for everyone.  It's not like the Italian bossa or cheery, cheesy tracks you might hear on the Sister Bossa comps.  It's nothing like what you might hear on Brazilectros or the other comps either.  This is a unique cd and I can't emphasis enough - it's very raw, and that's actually what draws you into the music.  There have been other albums out long since this that may be more someone's speed - check out another compilation titled' ""A Rough Guide to Brazilian Electronica"" for starters.

1658,1185852,A102XSQH2IW56B,B000008G5I,Patrick Frierson,True,"Grand daddy I.U. is so Smooth, he'll make Dove soap feel like sandpaper. There's rappers past and present who kicked pimp s*it, but very few can swing it as well as the U. He has a nonchalant charisma that suggests he's a Mack by nature.  In other words, it doesn't sound forced. Where as other rappers claim to be pimps, Grand Daddy I.U. doesn't really have to because he has a natural presence that's missing from a lot of MC's who claim to have had a stroll. Rather than me sell you on that game, I'm going to let you know how I.U. sells his game on ""Smooth Assassin"".  Case in example is the opening track where he flows over a familiar sample.  ""The U is Smooth"" comes across so elegant that he sounds like a guest host at The Cotton Club in 1920's Harlem. On ""I Kick A.."" he throws more joints than a double header main event as he displays a funky type of gangsta wit that make him sound like Tommy Gibbs with rap lyrics.  Mass Destruction shows I.U. as a one man natural disaster with devastating lines like "" Destruction/ whenever I come/ There ain't nothin' left when I'm done/ The only thing that remains is ashes and dust/ Blood Stains and veins from brains that I bust/Cities and towns burned down to the ground/ Blows and echoes- screams in the background/ All feel the wrath of a psychopathic/ Death scenes are graphic/ stopping all traffic/ As I demolish MC's/ When I'm gone, ain't nothin' standing, not even the trees. With a mellow jazzy loop backing him, I.U. is a human tornado sweeping a quiet village where fake MC's retreat. The raunchiness kicks in with the reggae tinged ""Girls Dem So Hot"" and ""Girl in the Mall"". The latter makes Too $hort look like Mr. Rogers as he lays down the details of his booty call from a cashier he meant at....you guessed it- the Mall!  The Chronological detailed pattern in which he tells the story make you feel like a pet in Virginia's apartment with your eyes glued to the action (Virginia is the woman that he lays). ""Kay Cee is Nasty"" finds his DJ gettin his shine on. The record is one of the funniest and most memorable DJ solos I ever heard as he uses a series of Richard Pryor excerpts to tell you how nasty he is on the turntables. Especially funny is the repetitious chant of f*ckin' is good! .That track alone comes close to outdoing the U on his own record until he takes control back with ""Nobody Move"". The laid back jazzy bassline and Daddy U's trademark smoothness punctuates a robbery tale that sounds like a deleted scene from Hoodlum as he holds up a gambling spot,  bank, and end up behind bars. The laidback bass line gives the song an old fashioned gangsta feel from the great depression era. Think of Bumpy Johnson planning a heist with his crew and you'll get the feel behind ""Nobody Move"".  ""Behind Bars"" is one of the best cautionary tales ever made about the perils of drug and prison life. At the surface it may sound like a rip off from Kool G Rap's ""Rikers Island"" but I.U.'s tale breaks down prison life from a fallen Drug Dealer's perspective as to how it affects him inside as well as outside the prison walls- as opposed ""Rikers Island"" where G. Rap breaks down the dangers of internal prison life and what's necessary for survival. Though ""This is a Recording"" serves a summarization of who he is as a MC - it's a afterthought compared to ""Sugar Free"" where his intentions with women is summed up with a line that goes:...So it's a dead issue for you to pursue/ cuz boo, I love you but I love others too! He has a Pimp's honesty that's real, but it's so subtle to the point where you really can't get mad at him for womanizing. At least he's an honest one. The R&B vocals is probably one of the vainest examples of musical indulgences I heard since Isaac Hayes ""Joy"" ,but it does add a unforgettable charm as she sounds like one of many heartbroken women who as Grand Daddy would say ""Sugar Free"".  There are some songs that are better than others, but I.U. is frequently on target with ""Smooth Assassin"". While the laid back stoned beats may be a bit too leisure for some, it complements his flow perfectly. In fact, between the three records he released, this is the album that defines his style best. Having heard this album, I don't understand the comparisons with Big Daddy Kane.  Sure I.U. kick battle rhymes and pimped out lyrics with a flamboyant appearance like Kane, but there's a major difference that separates the two MC's. I.U. thrives on self confidence while Kane thrives on vanity.  When I.U. spits, he's not tryin so hard to make you believe he's a smooth mutha...., it just rolls off of him like water from a shower and you end up believing him because he (I.U.) believes him.  When Kane spits, he goes out his way to show you why he's a smooth mutha.... - and by the end of the record, you're sold. Not to put Kane down, or to say one is better than the other, but if you listen closely to both men's flow, you'll notice that both are different ingredients in the same pot of soup.  If you're a serious hip hop head, you'll pick up ""Smooth Assassin"" because the U's so smooth, he'll make you ""believe it's not butter"".",5,"11 13, 2008","IT'S NOT PARKAY, IT'S THE ONE DADDY U",1226534400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,dealer's defines gibbs dust wall r&b go devastate sample bar event notice scream sell vain kane understand stand ever drug shower stroll complement hear nobody mr indulgence subtle mellow johnson mutha ash soap get many thing open at....you flow sure different song header jazzy really stain wrath tell guest solo funny survival point let blow believe type peril target u's bit across butter would brain i.u.'s i.u pimp flow familiar sum separate harlem tinged water delete outdo hayes rapper sound release show main leisure ingredient presence quiet gettin two heist hoodlum mean elegant cashier pryor funny pimp force gangsta mass example do wit may chant know rip lyric hard move joy pattern record fake cotton like serf womanize vocal sell woman hip come smoothness shine tree listen affect charm can't mall claim intention tornado he'll club sell musical serious blood fall well charisma echo turntable appearance oppose s*it danger kick one death love goes:...so bumpy girl make beat crew give town perfectly cee self tryin island line psychopathic call sandpaper f*ckin tommy game apartment heartbroken cautionary inside human mc's flamboyant memorable scene case believe pursue style since story old rogers though take back behind village girl there's bassline stop three rap's retreat plan he's rather latter record spot reggae head chronological natural pimp's spit stone believe song nasty think others hot destruction dj least whenever fashioned tell excerpt big virginia bass graphic laidback leave scene sweep dead robbery frequently series lot go back kick men's free good suggests gamble boo bank summarization come mad major alone prison guess present swing what's background rap throw close tale nothin find vanity man rikers make pet i'm word best trademark break mack look life isaac honesty closely well sugar loop say confidence difference unforgettable depression afterthought control assassin track burn woman richard repetitious double glue soup remain way example smooth host surface hort add action nonchalant display nature pimp kick pick great roll eye feel real rhyme line kay put record thrive hop that's fact miss daddy punctuates issue comparison perspective compare virginia's go sound detail probably outside raunchiness ain't especially album hold lay disaster bust/cities honest even necessary ground battle cuz joint dive tale booty grand mc dem funky traffic laid vein end demolish make detail past show internal us pot era kool

Producer Arif Mardin has made the right decision to keep the production stripped down in the studio, allowing RM's immense vocal range, blinding guitar playing, those percussive finger taps and the simply amazing trumpet solo scat to balance one another in exactly the proportions that this genius employs when standing under a spotlight without support or interference from any other musical backing.

1664,573610,A4VH04TA14CPE,B00029KZMM,Angry Mofo,False,"Sure, Orbital always had the occasional dissonant numbers, but at their best, they made better melodies than just about any other techno band. Even when they made slow, melancholy tracks, the keyboards were always so clean and melodic as to lift one's spirits anyway, and when they were applied to loud, fast dance anthems with tough beats, like ""Lush 3-1,"" the result was sheer Ecstasy. So it's kind of a surprise that the Blue Album really doesn't have much in the way of those bright-eyed, bushy-tailed melodies at all. On the contrary, the feel of the album is very ambiguous; even a pleasant diversion like ""Bath Time"" sounds a bit subdued, a bit uncertain. This is largely due to Orbital's use of the claustrophobic bass sound of early techno. Some of the chirping effects in ""Transient"" could have come from a decade-old Black Dog Productions track, and ""Lost"" has a cold, chiming melody that looks back to Autechre's first two albums.  As if to accentuate Orbital's newly dark aesthetic, ""You Lot"" steals the main rhythm from Underworld's timeless track ""Dirty."" The skittish synthesizer patterns in the same track are also very similar to those in Underworld's ""Dark Hard."" But where Underworld's night-time city was alternately menacing and sad, Orbital's is luminous and sterile, deliberately artificial like the highways and tunnels leading away from a major international airport. (""Pants"" is a great track to listen to while driving in just such a setting.) The heavily distorted vocal samples at the end of ""You Lot"" call to mind another techno landmark, Juan Atkins' ""Night Drive Through Babylon."" To this classicist style, which has been dormant for so long (thanks to ""jungle"") that it actually sounds quite fresh on this album, Orbital add their recent interest in film music. The melody in ""Easy Serv"" sounds like it was stolen from some melancholy seventies-era romantic film; it would be perfect for watching the handsome protagonist walk past some bystanders down a rainy autumn street with a thoughtful look on his face. ""Transient"" has a violin melody at the end that would fit the opening credits of a pretty good noir film.  Unfortunately, Orbital also have a sense of humour, and on top of that they want to take one last stab at dance music, so we get ""Acid Pants,"" which revolves around the repetition of an unbelievably obnoxious sample as drum machines whack away in the background. I doubt many people will dance to it. To make up for that, however, they also reprise a good Orbital tradition: vague social commentary in the form of foreboding samples. As longtime Orbital fans will recall, they did this back when they were protesting against the anti-rave Criminal Justice Bill of 1994 by inserting ominous film samples about totalitarianism into ""Forever,"" the gorgeous opening track of their album Snivilisation. This time around, ""You Lot"" features a bloke expressing the view that mankind is insufficiently aware of the possible negative consequences of altering DNA and cultivating destructive bacteria. Ah, Orbital, always looking out for us.  ""One Perfect Sunrise,"" the last track, seems like a pretty obvious rewrite of Orbital's well-known ""Halcyon + On + On."" Unfortunately, it doesn't have any hooks half as good as the guitar echo and the main rhythm of the 1992 hit, so the instrumental build-up isn't nearly as effective. However, it does have guest vocalist Lisa Gerrard (known for her work in Dead Can Dance, and more recently, for composing the score to the film Whale Rider), which goes very far indeed. As a singer, Gerrard is miles above Kirsty Hawkshaw, who did the airy cooing in ""Halcyon + On + On,"" and entirely thanks to her, ""One Perfect Sunrise"" goes straight from a pointless rehash of Orbital's former glory to a song that nearly equals it.  I find myself wondering: who's going to be listening to this album five or ten years down the line? Orbital announced the end of their career before releasing it; they presented it as a deliberate swan song, a sort of album-length thank-you note to their fans. That deliberately retrospective approach already implies that the album isn't an effort to blaze exciting new trails in electronica (even though, in reality, it significantly departs from Orbital's established style, in feel if not in technique). It's as if Orbital themselves acknowledged that their time was past, and gave up in advance on any possibility of breaking new ground, which means that it's unlikely that any of the tracks on the album are going to become smash hits at Da Club. That's a shame, because it really is a pretty good album, and deserves a wide audience. Sure, it hasn't got the same highs as Orbital 2, but it's much more consistently good, and it makes a far better end to Orbital's career than The Altogether.

1693,838034,AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B003BKF696,R. M. Ettinger,False,"""I was carried - to Ohio in a swarm of bees"".  I am loving that lyric. It's a stand-out line from the National song ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"", which might be the centerpiece of their new album, 'High Violet'. But there are many highlights on this disk.  Actually, I'm loving the disk too - and you know how I really don't like much of anything, so that's kind of saying something, no?  Folks - we have a contender for the best release of 2010 !!!!!!  If Arcade Fire doesn't completely hit it out of the park with their disk in two months, the National might take the title for this year.  Back in 1987, my friend Jon once told me about my music choices, ""it's good.....but down"" or was it, ""it's down.....but good"". Either way, you get where he was coming from; and where I come from. If I were a teenage girl, I'd just go for the Bell Jar set to music.  Matt Berninger's tenor (and sometimes baritone) is riveting and haunting. When I first listened to the new disk, I wanted to stay put and turn away all at the same time. But in reality, I'm totally captivated.  I'd say the group isn't like anything you've heard before, but that's not entirely true. While they are not like Arcade Fire exactly, you can see some similar elements, but it mostly the lead vocal. AF, musically, can throw in everything and the kitchen sink - along with a running disposal. Not so much with the National.  On first listen, you might say the disk goes fairly minimalist, but the subtle layers only make you think that. When you really listen, it's pretty hypnotic and captivating. I can reference many of the songs, but ""Runaway"" comes to mind with the mostly a guitar and slowly swelling trumpets.  Lyrically, they are all over it. ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"", which I referenced at the beginning of this review, is great, but by no means the only one. Take ""Conversation 16"" with ""I'll tell you miserable things after you are asleep"" and ""I was afraid....I'd eat your......brain"". That last lyric isn't so much the words as the phrasing and almost lack of intonation in the vocal.  I'm a big fan of ""England"", ""Sorrow"", ""Anyone's Ghost"", ""Afraid of Everyone"" - actually of most every song. The only one that doesn't jump out for me is ""Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks"", even though it's a great title.  I go back and forth to what my favourite song on the disk. I shouldn't say, because it changes on every listen. That's not a bad thing - as I swear I hear new things each time. But at this very moment, ""Conversation 16"" might be it.  If you listen casually, you might say all the songs sound the same.  They don't.  For the most part, the tempo does, at least seemingly, but that's not really true either.  'High Violet' isn't necessarily a background music kind of album, it is a sit and listen to it kind of disk.  I think after you get to know it, it could make an amazing background kind of record.

It fairly much has everything to do with the lyrics. Many of them appear to be specifically written to appeal to airheads of the worst sort (check out the lyrics to ""Lookin' Up Lookin' Down""); but, conversely, there are a number of lyrics that weren't nearly as bad as some people contended (for example, the lyrics to ""Song for Sagittarians"" aren't bad at all...but in that same crowd there weren't a lot of people that would admit to listening to a song entitled ""Song for Sagittarians"" out of fear of being labeled as some sort of astrology buff, you know what I mean?).  But here's the interesting thing: When rigorously confronted by one or more of their peer group, a good many of the aforementioned would admit to liking the album and to listening to it on a semi-regular basis (usually until something like ""Lookin' Up  Lookin' Down"" finally got to them, in which case their copy of the album would meet with its demise).  What made them overlook the lyrics, sometimes for extensive periods of time? Perhaps Shawn Phillips' soulful voice and the melodies and the music (for example, ""Song for Sagittarians"" not only rocks, it's quite good to dance to; and there's the intoxicating bits and pieces of brass and orchestral music Phillips inserts here and there throughout). In general, a number of these songs are quite catchy.  However, publically I'm still in agreement with that crowd that would always contend that Second Contribution is lame.

1698,1079129,A3EUUHAB232JOI,B01BWIVHS2,Dane,True,"Vinyl - The good. The recording, mastering and pressing are very well done. The imaging is great, the audio is smooth, defined and has the sweet presence vinyl sound you can't get with a digital file even at 96K/24 bit floating point. 45 RPM allows for more audio details streaming off the LP and this LP has a lot. The music is bluesy and easy listening. Rock and Roll it's not. I am very happy with the LP after listening to all four sides twice as I'm a blues fan, not so much for easy listening. The bad - Clearly the target for the engineers was the best audio possible, hence the 45 RPM playback speed. I'm all for that, but to get all the great sound from this LP you'll need a low mass tonearm and high compliant cartridge to extract all the goodness from the groves. Pro-ject buyers will have to question the decision to purchase what they thought was a great turntable that is a hassle to play 45 RPM LPs. We will only see more 45 RPM LPs in the future as analog is back and getting better all the time. If your cartridge can't keep up and is causing breakup sounds trying to follow the groove, I suggest setting up your tonearm using the HiFiNews Analogue Test LP. Side 1 track 9 is where you should adjust your anti skate for even left and right breakup. Track 9 is a monster and will easily highlight incorrect anti skate settings. Nothing else will give a better setting as dials and weights are notoriously unpredictable for being correct from the factory. The pressing I received has some visible goobers peeling out of the grooves on side A track 2 only, but other than that it's very flat and well done. I'm going to try alcohol as my RCA brush and AT634 fluid don't dissolve whatever the goobers are made of. Probably mold release. I love the old Duals with the ultra low mass tone arms that have a RCA cable upgrade. I also recommend the best bang for the buck Audio-Technica AT440MLa Dual Moving Magnet Cartridge if you can afford it.

1699,891641,AHYWFAWKX0496,B005STGJTY,Jason L. Greenberg,True,"This is a great power metal cd, with very catchy choruses, complex and interesting guitar arrangements and thought provoking clever lyrics.  I hear inspirations from Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, and even Opeth.  Every song is written with the vocal melody as the core.  It is obvious that Theocracy writes their music with their vocal melodies in mind first.  Many prog/power metal bands let their guitarists write all the music and then cram in vocal melodies as an afterthought.  Not so with Theocracy- every instrument is given its appropriate time to shine.  Matt is a tremendous singer and has an ear for infectious melodies.  This is one of my favorite power/prog metal albums in a long time, even surpassing their previous album, Mirror of Souls. The production value is top notch as well!  Listen to the samples to check out the music, it is all incredibly well crafted and arranged with skill.  The lyrics are overtly Christian themed.  Even though I myself am Christian, I've never been able to listen to much Christian music for enjoyment as most of it is very poorly written- corny and superficial.  Matt's lyrics are hard hitting and powerful.  Each song has a point and he delivers his message without sounding preachy or offensive.  This is the first Christian metal band that gives me the same satisfaction I get from listening to a band like Dream Theater or Blind Guardian.  Matt Smith, the singer, main songwriter, and lyricist digs very deep into reformed theology, singing about things like Paul's writings on the old/new man and the internal battle of two natures as well as Martin Luther's 95 theses which helped trigger the Reformation.

I saw this some years ago in a revival, and it is charming, but very much of its time. For those who haven't seen the show, there are big plot problems, which would make it unrevivable for today's audiences. Lilli herself comes across as more than a sweet, simple girl from the country. She just seems simple. And the major plot point that she is unaware that the difficult cripple, and the man who charms her with the puppets are one and the same is a seriously difficult one to swallow. 'It's Magic, Magic!' was the real showstopper. But we can't see the show business that made it so exciting on the stage here. It  pulls the 'magic' elements of the whole show together, so it works as a whole. But if you are a Broadway buff, you should own it. It  was one of the first shows to do away with a curtain, so the stage slowly comes to life as the cast puts the travelling circus together in front of us.

This is where Soulfly took a turn for the heavier,after changing direction from Prophecy. The album starts with The Dark Ages a creepy string intro that leads you into Babylon which is a heavy fast paced,head banging guitar groove driven song. I and I is awesome just relentless and fast,drums kicking like crazy and bass rumbling away. Carved Inside is really groovy with some tribal influenced instruments. Arise Again is super fast in vein of Refuse/Resist with ferocious guitars and wicked thick drum patterns. The album is their heaviest since their first album(self titled) Molotov is a mosh pit song with break-neck guitar speeds and bass that rumbles with ferocity. Frontlines is another mosh anthem,Max vocals are brutal. They blaze through this song with their best guitar chords and just stop-start guitars. Innerspirit is anazingly melodic and beautiful,guest vocals from the same guy who added guest vox on Moses(Prophecy) it has some really spacy island tribal vibes to it. Corrosion Creeps is another song almost like Attitude,the bass drones and the drums are really intricate. Riotstarter seems to be their version of Prodigy's Firestarter but totally Cavalera'd out,this is so damn catchy with a fast-paced groove. Nice guitar vibes and excellent basslines,the speed of the song is just fast enough to make you move your body & bang your head. Bleak is far from bleak,it is percussive and vocally incredible. It is like a metal grenade thrown into your ears,the March is like a battle theme for when your ready to fight. It is a fight song,to get you pumped. Fuel the Hate is a raw & rough song that makes your head bang uncontrollably,they put there energy this baby & spit there hate at the posers(listen to the lyrics) Staystrong is a really killer song,a good 10 minutes long that starts off heavy and blends into a smooth island style tropical guitar & flamenco's are added to give it extra layers. The album closer is the instrumental Soulfly V and it is so beautifully melodic,they really have grown into their zone. They know there strongpoints and they really add newer and newer instruments & experiment with the sound. The album is solid from start to finish,the album is a piece of art and it does not have any weak points whatsoever. This is by far the best album other than the self titled,Conquer & Omen. This band just seems unstoppable but Max Cavalera is such a brilliant musician,his work with Spultura is legendary.

This band is definately the ""new thing"", with their catchy vocal harmonies, and very, very good lyrics.  Although it is nothing ground-breaking, unique, or original, it is good music.  The music tends to be rather bland and unimainative at times, but the ""back-and-forth"" style dual vocals keep the listener rather interested.  It really sounds awesome when the lead vocalist holds out a note.  He is not the kind of singer that has the kind of amazing voice that strikes you right away, but it is a voice that you really just like to listen to.  I must say, the vocals really save this album.  If the vocals weren't as good, the CD would be a waste.  The lyrics are also great on this CD, with many quoteable lines, such as my favorite, ""...the truth is you could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath, I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt,"" from ""You're So Last Summer"".

The two ""book ends"" (the first and last songs) are both weak in my opinion.  TBS could've chosen better songs to kick off and end the album.  But aside from that fact, and the fact that the screaming is very weak on this CD, there really aren't many unforgiveable flaws.  You could do much worse than to pick this up.

1722,30072,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000001AW2,Mike,False,"This is one of a very few live rock albums that cannot possibly be over-hyped. Jerry Lee is beyond dangerous on this album...he makes the snarling, hip-swaying, swaggering Black Leather Comeback Elvis look like Richie Cunningham by comparison.  The Rolling Stone review for the album claimed ""'Live At The Star Club, Hamburg' is not an album, it's a crime scene.""  I view the album through the filter of a Val Kilmer Doc Holliday quote in the movie ""Tombstone""...""Oh, make no mistake. It's not revenge he's after. It's a reckoning.""  You see, on April 5, 1964...when this album was recorded, many fans, as well as the music press, had turned their backs on Jerry Lee over his ""indiscretions"" and his 1958 marriage to his cousin, Myra Brown, who was 13 at the time of their vows.  Jerry Lee was on the road back, but for all intents and purposes, in light of his career trajectory prior to the marriage, he was still fighting his way back from exile, still reclaiming his lost turf. Other performers would have buckled under the scrutiny and criticism, would have folded up their tent and wandered off into obscurity, but not Jerry Lee. He was defiant, he was feral, he was the Killer, and the Killer had come to the Star Club for a concert...and a reckoning.  It takes him all of 20 seconds to hurl himself, head-first, into a blistering vortex of pure, aggressive, unbridled rock & roll that doesn't let up for 40 minutes. He's introduced...he acknowledges the cheers of the audience with a menacing, teasing little tiger purr, followed by a few glissando strokes of the keyboard, and BLAM...it's ""go time,"" with the Killer eviscerating Ray Charles' ""Mean Woman Blues.""  The next song is one of Jerry Lee's own, ""High School Confidential""...""Come on, little baby, I wanna rock a little bit tonight..."" He can hardly spit the words out with enough venom to match the Herculean hammering of his piano as he bellows ""YEAH! SHAKE THAT THING!""...and at this point we're only about 5 minutes into the show.  At the end of the track the audience begins chanting ""Jer-RY! Jer-RY! Jer-RY!""...it's a thing of beauty.  He tones down the ferocity...but not the intensity...on ""Money,"" the next track. What's ""over-confidence"" in the hands of Jerry Lee Lewis? Is that even possible? He's supremely cool, arrogant, fully in control...""Your lovin' gives me such a thrill, but your love just won't pay my bills...""  In similar fashion, ""Matchbox"" allows Jerry Lee to recharge the battery for his next full-frontal attack, but he is by no means on cruise control.  Next up is a two-part assault on another Ray Charles classic, ""What'd I Say."" He'd later dust this one off again in the Seventies for a rockin' version on the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Session-recorded-in-London-w-great-guest-artists/dp/B000BQS6TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The (Complete) Session recorded in London w/ great guest artists</a>, but here, it's howlin' and bangin' time again.  On what was originally the opening track of the vinyl release's side two, Jerry Lee returns to his own hits with ""Great Balls of Fire."" Following that are workouts on Little Richard's ""Good Golly Miss Molly,"" then is own ""Lewis Boogie,"" Hank Williams' ""Your Cheating Heart,"" and a brutal ""Long Tall Sally,"" before the crown jewel...""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.""  He takes his time with this one...more of that cool, calm confidence...at the one minute mark he shouts ""Oh, let's GO now,"" and the band's challenge is to keep up with him as he progressively ratchets up the heat. Then there's the ""EEEEEEASY now, let's get it on down real low"" teaser middle, before...at 3:22 he bellows ""LET'S GO ONE TIME"" and all bets are OFF. All of the hype, all of the legend, all of the fact versus fiction, all of the things this man was supposed to be...as well as ""who"" and ""what"" he was in reality...lights up the sky like an out-of-control Fourth of July on this track. This is the kind of recording you put in a time capsule so that centuries from now, our great-great-great-great grandchildren will be able to immediately grasp the concept of ""rock & roll.""  The set closes with ""Down The Line,"" another track that found a new life on ""The Session,"" but by this point Jerry Lee has reclaimed the crown and we're simply given one more series of left hooks and right jabs before he triumphantly brings the show to a close.

It supplies your body and mind with energy like no other album except of the masterwork, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Mother's Milk introduces Chad Smith on drums and most important, John Frusciante's funky guitar work. You can hardly call it work, it sounds like all the members having the same fun and excitement like the listeners.

'Knock me down' is the most beautiful and melodic song on this CD but better don't keep it too much in your head cos the lyrics of the chorus really knock you down.

Christina's voice is also beautiful, and the way she sings ballads on this album like ""The Voice Within"", ""Cruz"", and the higher notes on ""Dirrty"" is just the way a singer should sing.

If this is part is commercialized, it's working very well! The best songs are ""Dirrty"", ""Beautiful"", ""The Voice Within"", and ""Infatuation"".

1731,1106534,A2J7B7F2J7V4DM,B000001GHT,Chosroes III,False,"My Schumannmania dates back a long way-- even before I ever heard a single note I knew I would love him, thanks to his bio, with its forbidden love, marital passion, duelling with the Philistines, and of course the inevitable descent into madness.  But Schumann was an irrepressible, if agitated, soul, as is borne out by the idiosyncratic fervor of his four symphonies.  The ""Spring""s opening movement is one of those endlessly exhilarating experiences in art that never fails to give the spirit a kick-- without being reductively a piece of ""program music,"" it manages to suggest the fructifying power of incipient spring-- even to tickle the skin with the physiological symptoms of ""spring fever.""  And this is a quality spread throughout Schumann's orchestral canon, from which the immortal ""Manfred Overture"" and the rich ""Genoveva"" are also included on these discs.  All are glorious, but it would be a pity not to single out the extraordinary ""Adagio espressivo"" of the 2nd Symphony, a movement which rivals even Mahler at his most transcendentally expressive-- and Schumann is not a child of the Wagnerian era. Nor can I fail to cite the shuddering grandeur of the fourth movement of the ""Rheinish"" Symphony, an interlude of intense pathos in that galloping,  impish, lighthearted, always loveable work.  Schumann is still a controversial composer, but perhaps I love him for all the reasons Nietzsche did not (with all respect to the sage!).

Very bluesy with Michel holding a repeated blues lick to a fantastic climax. September Second starts out as latin tinged number which shows that melodic flair. It develops to a number of tremendous climaxs helped by Steve Gadds incendiary drumming.  Little Peace in C for U is a be-bop inspired piece, again with moments of genius from the little man.  Anthony Jackson and Steve Gadd are both excellent. Their backing is sometimes a little more aggressive than some traditional Jazz trios, in particular Gadd adds perhaps more 'rock' based drumming techniques than some may like.

This album has some heavy metal, prog, pop, and much more.  I love DT's approach on this one.  I happen to really enjoy the opener, The Root of All Evil.  This song rocks hard.  Sure they use a bit from Dying Soul, but I thought it was cool.  Don't forget that part of Metropolis was used in Home, and nobody complained then.  The Answer Lies Within is a great song.  It is very mellow, and beautiful in it's own right.  There is no shredding on this one, but who says that DT has to shred on every song anyway.  Hell, Another Day and Surrounded are popish songs that are awesome, yet nobody seemed to complain about those either.  These Walls is another heavy tune, and is probably one of the stronger songs on the album.  I Walk Beside You has a similar vibe to U2, but I really like this song.  If anyone has seen the 5 years in a livetime video, DT does a similar sounding song in their unplugged show in Holland.  I'm not sure what the song was called, but it said something like ""Tell Me What You're Thinking"".  That song was awesome, and so is I Walk Beside You.  Panic Attack is a very heavy tune that is fun to listen to.  Never Enough has an awesome solo section where Petrucci and Rudess play in unison.  If you listen carefully, you will hear some of the best soloing I've heard Petrucci do.  Sacrificed Sons is a very beautiful song.  It begins pretty mellow, but builds up to a fury.  This is one of the best songs on the album.  Octavarium is a beautiful song.  There are too many textures to name.  Many of DT's influences can be heard.

Nothing that Fagan,Becker or Steely Dan have put out since the early 80's has been an exception. That being the case nothing on 'Morph The Cat'sounds dated at all-it has the classic groove sound these guys always do have and could've been made anytime in the last thirty years. It's all very timeless. It's not too surprising either but as always there are subtle differences. A good example is the scaling vocal dynamics of the title song and ""What I Do""-now that tune is a reworking/tribute to Ray Charles that has Fagan's sardonic wit all over it and is rather hard edged.'Morph The Cat' overall is the least optimistic of Fagan's solo releases and it's lyrics explore subject matters such as sadness and politics. The best political song here is the funny ""Security Joan"",one of those great funky grooves about Fagan's fetish for an airport security guard-his chants of ""Frisk me baby"" have that flavor of 'Royal Scam'-era Steely Dan or 'The Nightfly'.Some songs like ""The Bright Nitegown"" are highly repetetive but that can be a good thing too. The slowest tune here is the ""The Great Pagoda Of Funn"" and that being said 'Morph The Cat' consists mostly of up to midtempo tunes. No 'Morph The Cat' is certainly not as crowd pleasing as 'The Nightly' or as welcoming as 'Kamakiriad' but is a tad more well written then the most recent Steely Dan release 'Everything Must Go'.So far there seems to be no such thing as 'bad' Fagan or Steely Dan but some release are certainly stronger then others. That went for the 1970's as much as today. That being the case in terms of musicianship and sound music doesn't get much tighter then this.

Hey, it's evolution baby. ""Riot Act"" is the next phase of evolution. Sounding mostly like a sister cd to Binaural, Riot Act shows you more of the mellow yet more musical side of Pearl Jam. Before with albums like ""Ten"" ""Vs."" ""Yeild"" and ""Vitology"" their sound was riding on the hooks of their singles. Now with Binarual and Riot Act they're riding on the ingenuity of the flow and build of the album. Listening to ""Riot"" is a different kind of experience because it puts you in the middle of a Pearl Jam jam session.

I bet you half these people don't even bother to listen to them.  What they are are is a wonderful group of musicians who are well honed at the craft.  In their original incarnation Toto Consisted of six men.  Bobby Kimball-Lead Vocals Steve Lukather-Lead Guitar, Vocals David Paich-Keyboards, Vocals Steve Porcaro-Keyboards, Vocals David Hungate-Bass Guitar Jeff Porcaro-Drums, Percussion    These Guys had already been Session men for a whole bunch of artists, Notable at the time was Boz Scaggs.  However by 1977 they decided to form a band of their own.  Toto was born.  That year this album was recorded.  Let me tell you folks what a way to start your career.  Rich harmonies, superb hooks and mind-blowing playing abounds.    The album kicks off with an instrumental called Child's Anthem.  An interesting choice.  I like it though.  It's quick high energy and to the point.  I'll Supply the Night follows and is just great.  It has an Anthem like Chorus and a funky verse section.  It introduces us to Bobby Kimball on vocals.  He just shakes your house down.  His voice works perfectly with Toto.  Great R N B type vocals.    Georgy Porgy is a smooth laid back Boz Scaggs type song with Steve Lukather on vocals.  Sure the chorus is ridiculous but the vibe is just so cool it hardly matters. We are introduced to David Paich on Manuela Run, which is one of my favs. Dave is great on vocals and this song just has a chorus to die for...so infectious.

Her voice has darkened, deepened, and has a ""dusky"" and ""husky"" quality to it now, and she doesn't have quite the resonance and brilliance that she had even 10 years ago, but even so, her voice is still incredibly rich and smooth. And she can still belt a high note like no one's business. She works magic with each and every song she sings, completely enthralling the listener. Especially magical and beautiful are ""The music of the night"" and ""Somewhere"", both of which she sings with the Pop/Opera group ""Il Divo"". The sound of her voice interwoven with theirs, especially at the climax of each song is, yet again, beautiful, magical and exhilarating. But of course, Barbra is all of those things when she sings alone as well.  She sings for us some of the staple songs of her long career, such as ""The way we were"", ""Evergreen"" (which she also does with Il Divo and in a variety of different languages), and ""People"". She also sings for us some songs from early in her career, such as ""Have I stayed too long at the fair?"", which is one of my personal favorites. She also treats us to a whole string of songs from ""Funny Girl"", some from the movie, and some from the stage version that didn't make it into the film. We are also privileged to get to hear her briefly play the piano, and then sing for us the very first song she ever wrote, ""Ma premiere chanson"". In this recording, she seems very relaxed and amicable towards the audience, as opposed to past times when she perhaps was more nervous and tense.

The songs he performs are not the same kind of ""fusion"" flare that you, the casual listener, are going to be accustomed to. He was a jazz fusion pioneer, sure, but things have changed since then. He's more into the classical side of arranging and playing now.  Having said that, his playing on this DVD is amazing. The sound quality and video are also good. The band he's playing with are all very well-versed musicians. The pianist he's playing with, I think he's name is Mario Parmisano, suprised me greatly. Al wouldn't be playing with a musician that isn't fantastic, so hats off to Al for his choice in musicians. Very strong rhythmic presence throughout.  As to comment on something a reviewer said in the review prior to mine, he mentioned how he was disappointed that Al Di Meola didn't talk to the audience more. Look, I think I can say wholeheartedly that you DON'T want Al Di Meola talking to the audience! Trust me folks, you couldn't bare it. Not only does he seem a bit stand-offish, but I honestly don't think he would know what to say other than something weird.  No offense to Al, but I don't want hear him talk. I want to hear him play, and that's the reason I purchased this DVD. To me, it's good enough to actually have something of him playing on DVD. If he doesn't talk or if he does really shouldn't be a valid complaint anyway. The review of any concert DVD should be a review of what it is, not what it could be.

The movie is an adaptation of a stage play, and Perry's translation of this to a movie has earned tonnes of harsh reviews.  The soundtrack, on the other hand, is a winner and an all women affair with something for everyone. Opening is ""Main Title"", a haunting string-swathed classical piano piece with poetic recitals by Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise and Janet Jackson, followed by the retro Soul ""Longer And Stronger"" by Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings. The lilting ""All Day Long (Blue Skies)"" is seventies Stevie Wonder-style Jazzy Soul done by Estelle, while ""What More Can They Do"" by Laura Izibor is groovy with echoing guitars. Lalah Hathaway lends her dusky vocals to the soulful piano ballad ""Sun"" while ""Ansomnia"" with stabbing bass, electro beats and swirling synths features Zaki Ibrahim.  ""Settle"" is acoustic Soul with Gladys Knight and choir-style backing vocals. ""La Donna In Viola"" is a Classical piece and features Karen Slack, Andrea Jones-Soloja and Hollywood Symphony Orchestra. ""Sechita (A Senhora Em Amarelo)"" is another recital, this time featuring Anika Noni Rose, Carondelet Percussion Ensemble against a clunky Jazzy backdrop. The bouncy Pop/Rock ""Stand Up"" features Macy Gray, and maintaining the tempo is Janelle Mone's catchy ""Without A Fight"".  ""Four Women"" is a Jazzy piano piece with Nina Simone, Simone (Nina Simone's daughter), Laura Izibor and Ledisi, truly outstanding.

My favorite songs are: ""Higher"", ""Heart's Song"", and ""I Hate You"". But I also rated ""Nu Creature"", ""Avaylable"", ""Broken Spirit"", and ""The Glory of the Lamb"" with 5-stars!  I love this album so much, I went on the artist's Myspace page and thanked him with a personal comment. His approach to worship and praise music is FRESH. Very much so. It's not the typical, expected, predictable gospel music that's grown flat over the last decade. This music incorporates rock, traditional asian and african instruments, and some tribal beats while demanding a very frank and real heart song from the soul. Some of these lyrics are frank and honest. Some of these lyrics are emotional coming from the depths of a believer's soul. The desire - the hunger - the pain and joy experienced in this faith are expressed throughout the album. I don't think the artist leaves one rock un-turned.  Moreover, this album has mass appeal - from the young to the old in faith. Those who have fallen away, those who are steadfast and those who are at the crossroads. ""Lord, please keep me in Your Will"" - is a plea. Very passionate plea.  Now is the time for honesty. For a believer to be honest with him or herself. Are you really a believer? Then hunger with me for more - dream with me of going HIGHER in faith. And let that be our reward. Not material possessions or strokes to our superegos...but real rewards. Let that be enough.

The song ""Mesmerised"" is cool too.this song sounds most like the seventies music. With all the instruments and her screaming like voice.

1797,1357942,AOEE8EPD15NE2,B001KH68GM,Adam Baldwin,False,"'Invaders Must Die' continues the Prodigy tradition of starting and finishing with a bang, and by my calculations is probably their best album yet (please note that I'm writing this after the release of 'The Day is My Enemy' and while I think that album probably doesn't surpass this one from what I've heard so far, I'm not considering that just yet since I haven't listened to it enough yet).  'Invaders Must Die' (the song) has some great drum sounds, great synths, great beats and bass. Yeah, I know, not very descriptive, right? What can I say, this song is AWESOME. Every bit as good of a lead-off song as 'Spitfire,' better than 'Smack My Bitch Up.' It sets the tone for an amazing album.  'Omen' is crazy good. Let me restate that, 'Omen' is a GREAT song. It has a sort of atonal quality to it, but is still very musical and incredibly catchy. 'Omen' is a song that will be considered a classic Prodigy song.  Everything that I just said about 'Omen' can be said about 'Thunder.' Right off the bat, three amazing songs. This is why this album is so hard to beat even when compared to other Prodigy albums. 'Thunder' is probably a better song than 'Omen,' even, which is saying A LOT.  'Colours' is fast-paced, syncopated beat with kind of a punk rock vibe. It's a really good song and very listenable.  'Take Me to the Hospital' ...wow. This song is like the total embodiment of The Prodigy as a group, and one of the best songs they've ever made. Every single bit of this song is perfect. Go watch the video on Youtube (which apparently has a tweaked audio track, as it's not the same exact song that's on my CD). Has to be the best song on the album, and that's not an easy statement to make (kinda like saying which Prodigy album is the best).  How do you follow up an amazing song like 'Take Me to the Hospital?' With 'Warrior's Dance.' I know I just said that 'Take Me to the Hospital' has to be the best song on the album, but I'm thinking that may have been wrong. This might be it. It's a dance beat, another Prodigy song that refuses to let my body stay still, but it feels like it harkens back to 'Music for the Jilted Generation,' which is probably another reason why I love it so much. Crap, I can't pick one over the other.  'Run With the Wolves' is a bit ""harder,"" sort of the punk rock style that Prodigy employs at time. This is a great song. On an album this good, it's almost filler since it can't touch the previous two songs, but on its own it's awesome. I'm listening to these tracks as I write this review to keep them fresh in my mind and I'm kind of blown away by how good this album really is. Not only are so many of these songs great, but there's not even a hint of a stinker in site.  'Omen Reprise' is basically a remix of 'Omen,' an incredibly good one. It really does sort of feel more like a reprise than an outright remix. The melody and lyrics are familiar but the structure of the song is entirely different. I normally don't like reprises but this quick little gem just always sounded great to me, like 'Omen' deconstructed.  'World's on Fire' is as much of a stinker as you're going to get on this album. It's still a great song. And I mean great. The fact that this song is probably the weakest song on this album makes me realize that 'Invaders Must Die' really is easily the best Prodigy album to date.  'Piranha' in some ways is similar to 'World's on Fire' and is probably the second-worst song on the album which, again, means nothing. Jeez, all of these songs are so darn listenable. There's a theremin-sounding instrument which captivates the song at one point, some great jungle beats, and I've stopped writing the review because I'm too busy listening to this great song.  Everything that I said about 'Shoot Down' on 'Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned' goes for 'Stand Up.' It is quite simply the perfect way to end this album. WOW, what a way to go out. So many great sounds in this song, and did you know that Dave Grohl did the drums? Yeah! It's got what sounds like some Roland TB-303 in it, and it's way less straight techno than most Prodigy songs but it does have a lot of sampling going on, and how can you not love the big sound of it all? I feel like this song is a celebration of what is capable with electronic music and how it can seamlessly integrate things like live drums and record samples and 303s while still sounding incredibly organic. I can't say enough about this song!  Having gone through listening to this album while writing the review, I'm shocked by how good it is. I've listened to it countless times and didn't realize how much I liked it because I listen to the other albums and think that they're really good, too. It really is the best Prodigy album by virtue of the fact that there are so many GREAT songs here and absolutely no stinkers to be found (a stinker, in Prodigyland, is a song that maybe you don't particularly care for or that is merely ""good"" instead of ""great""). Life is not complete without this album. Women think less of you if they find out you don't own this album. Just kidding, but seriously, why haven't you bought this album yet???  One note about this album: as I mentioned in my review of 'Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned,' this album sounds a LOT better on vinyl than it does on cd\mp3.

It's a lush and complex recording, probably the deepest Rush in an already deep pool of intense, intelligent thought-provoking material.  I was initially disappointed in the overall less-than-upbeat tone of the whole package, and I struggled to decipher melodies and hooks because of the sheer weight and verbosity of the lyrics.  But I am thrilled with the sound quality, and with repeated listenings and growing familiarity have found many gems in this collection of 13 songs.  I have nothing but renewed admiration for the trio who have given me such joy over the years; each new album serving as signpost and virtual diary of my own existence.  After two weeks, it's difficult to know precisely where to place this among the hierarchy of all Rush releases, but I'd put it up there easily in the top third.

Even if the timbre of Wiener's high nasal baritone were right for the role, which it isn't, it's hard to accept such a pinched, unattractive sound with such unmusical phrasing. The monologues go for little and the scene with Eva in the second act sounds like sadistic baiting though that could hardly have been the singer's intention.  Where is the warm brown voice allied to the simple humanity that Sachs should have - on the completes you get it with Schoffler even though he was past his prime and for the absolute best you have the excerpts with Friedrich Schorr. But this won't do at all - in addition you have Hans Hotter in absolutely terrible voice - no amount of intelligence can make up for the ruinous condition of the voice that evening. Keilberth plays it through with hardly any inflection or ideas of his own - the reading just sits there. Finally though this was supposed to be recorded live on opening night, the total absence of any audience noise or excitement (the gathering of the Guilds in Act Three is totally devoid of impetus) except at the ends of acts leads one to suspect most was recorded at the dress rehearsal .

1808,762325,A2WELK8CCU9MH8,B0013V2B2U,Socrates Stewart,True,"I purchased this item for the novely of seeing what it would be like buying an album on a USB stick. The potential for neat things is clearly there but this product offers nothing that couldn't be packaged in a regular CD/DVD format with a few additional data files.  All you get are a few extra pictures including a fascmile of the setlists for each nights with complete musician credits acknowleding little known facets like when Blondie Chaplin plays guitar on a few numbers, and Tim Ries on keyboards. You'd know these things if you've been to a Stones concert. The same booklet as for the CD is available as a PDF file. WOO-HOO.  Okay, there's the value-add in a nutshell for double the cost. You're going to probably download this on your iPOD anyway, so that might be a little faster than downloading off the Internet or from a CD. Is there anybody who is in that much of a hurry?  On to the album's content itself. This album maintains the long standing mystery that aside from ""Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out"" which is one of the best live albums of all times, in general, Stones live albums are very disappointing. The World's GREATEST Rock n Roll Band, the biggest draw, the kings of longevity, can't release a decent live album! To think there are dozens of live Grateful Dead albums, and even though I don't consider myself a ""Deadhead,"" I honestly enjoy having ""umpteen"" versions of ""Sugar Magnolia"" live because they capture the feeling of a Dead concert.  The Stones albums don't do that. I'm not going to rehash the trail of tears from ""Love You Live"" foward. ""Stripped"" is an interesting novelty as it has studio jams and acoustic performances. It doesn't really try to capture a full scale Stones concert anyway.  So here we have ""Shine A Light."" It might be better than some of the rest. The songs seem to follow the flow of a real Stones concert a little more accurately where some of their previous live albums are so randomly compiled. If you're going to get anything out of this album, you're going to have to play it extremely loud on a conventional stereo setup. The immersion of sound you'd get via a headset or car stereo makes it sound too artificial.  Keith and Ronnie are having a blast through out shooting guitar riffs off of each other. Daryl Jones and Charlie Watts lay down that slimy, greasy old Stones rhythm. Chuck Leavell plays a decent piano and pulls in the horns as needed for that extra punch.  Mick Jagger seems to be trying too hard to enunciate his lyrics rather than to just go with the flow and lead the show. After twenty six years, does anybody give a hoot you still can't understand him singing half the lyrics on ""Exile on Main Street?"" At times it sounds like Mick Jagger singing Rolling Stones karaoke!!!  Jack White really takes advantage of his cameo singing his duet on ""Loving Cup"" but everything else about the song stinks.  Some good points, ""As Tears Go By"" is one of the best live ballads they've ever recorded complete with Keith on 12 string. The instrumental performance is so strong that Jagger's wishy-washy vocals don't bring it down that much. This is the best live ""Sympathy for the Devil"" in a long time, but it still sucks. It sounds more like a live performance relying less on digital samples that has been the norm since ""Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle.""  Jagger sounds just plain silly. There's no drama. There's nothing menacing about his performance. It just's just so much better than thinking of fans paying for $100 seats getting to hear a computer play percussion. You actually get to hear Charlie's drums, and some of the ensemble banging on clangy things. Am I reaching for nice things to say about this album? YES!  The highlight of the album, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS???, it's Keith song, ""Little T&A."" Keith hardly ever sounds good on a live recording, but he's Keith. That he's still alive and conveys all that Keith attitude is good enough on stage anyway, but on this live album what makes it is the instrumental jam. First Keith and Ronnie are RED HOT. They then work into a quick little jam where Daryl Jones lays down one of the best live bass guitar passages for all time.  The strongest group performance is the title track, ""Shine a Light."" Jagger struggles to hit the notes at times, but the whole mood of the song is so powerful. It works as a wonderful closing piece to the album complete with two fine guitar solos just like the original.  One additional note, I reviewed the music from listening to the complete, not the editted CD. The USB stick was defective. Some of the pictures didn't load completely and some songs wouldn't load at all or skipped or missed miserably.  You're paying twice as much as the double CD version of the album, an album you'd probably only buy if you're a Stones completist or what a memeno of the concert tour which would be much better accomplished by purchasing the four DVD set from Best Buys which is worth it for just the Texas concert alone.  The stick is enclosed in a rubber cover shaped as the Stone's infamous tongue logo attached to a keychain. It's cute packaging. Double WOO-HOO.  For us aging baby-boomers there's a certain sense of reassurance to see the Stones still carry on, but as a serious listener, this is not a good album. If it weren't the Rolling Stones, this would be a throwaway album. I never thought I'd get so down on a Stones album, but the live CD's are piling up on the shelf and aside from ""Ya-Ya's"" not a single one screams ""Play me!"" except for the El Macambo set on ""Love You Live.""  Kids who are just getting into the Stones for the first time should go right to the classics and then download a song here, a song there from later on to enjoy the whole experience.

But  leave it to Neil to take his followers to the point of despair and then  come up with one of his very strongest collection of songs.

1820,541842,A363QRXP83K8ZE,B0000AGQ3K,N. P. Stathoulopoulos,False,"This DVD is a good value as it gathers both the New York 81 show (previously available on the VHS Taras Schevchenko) and the Reading Festival 98 show.  You get New Order 17 years apart, from the young men (and woman) leaving behind Joy Division to the older men (and woman) cranking out tunes again, getting ready for a comeback. The 1981 show is far more interesting than the later date.  The spare, moody lighting, the full yet cold electronics and the silent efforts of the band come across very well.  Even the opening shots of the venue are very fitting.  If you love this portion, I can't recommend the Peel Sessions CD enough.  It has the feel of this show and then some. As one reviewer noted of Taras Schevchenko, the band does not speak with the audience or even to each other.  Their heads are down and they play some great songs that sound much richer than some of the mixes from Movement.  I love the haunting ""Truth"" and a real treat is an early live version of the classic ""Temptation"". It might just be me, but lately I find most music videos to be almost unnecessary and generally unrewarding.  If you really love listening to the music, you might not gain much from watching the people play on a DVD or video.  You may even be turned off by it.  Case in point is the Reading material.  The 98 show is significant because it was a sort of comeback show for the band, albeit several years before they would release a disc of new material (Get Ready in 01).  New Order never went in for big stage shows, favoring simple lighting and playing and avoiding pyrotechnics and movies and other assorted gimmicks.  The show sounds great, but there is nothing to see.  The band looks a little crustier, and Peter Hook appears to be bombed, which makes it distractingly funny at times.  The version of Temptation is fantastic though; it was release on the 60 Miles An Hour Maxi single in 2002. Highly recommended for fans though.

I have been a fan of garage rock's retelling of the doo-wop era's chorale pop since The Ravonettes and The Prissteens began re-computing the old cliches of Frankie Avalon and Fabian.  What is especially refreshing with Cults is they are more subtle than The Raveonettes and push the envelope farther as well.  Garage rock goes electronic, and the radio is on in the wrong direction.  In other words, Cults crosses through the radio silence.  OK.  Think Blondie, reconsidered, and the static is like getting beamed-up like Spock to a UFO bearing crowds of beauties in miniskirts and interesting textile texturing.

1831,253650,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000002VMD,Lawrance Bernabo,False,"There have been a lot of successful soundtrack albums from ""West Side Story"" and ""The Sound of Music"" to ""Grease"" and ""Titanic,"" but in all of those cases the movies were big successes as well.  However, in the case of ""The Bodyguard"" the album was way more successful than the film selling over 15 million copies, spending 20 weeks at the top of the charts, and winning the Grammy award for Album of the Year.  Then there was the hit single, ""I Will Always Love You,"" a powerful cover of Dolly Parton's sweet little song, which hit the #1 spot on the Billboard singles chart and stayed there for 15 weeks.  Of course where ""The Bodyguard"" was different from most soundtracks was that the leading lady not only did her own singing but happened to be at the top of her game.  True, she only sang the first six songs on the album (what would have been the first side of the record back in the olden days), but these were songs that sounded like Houston was still recording ""I'm Your Baby Tonight,"" except with better songs.  Consequently, there is nothing here that is regarded as a stretch for the singer turned actress (compare the results with what Bette Midler had to do in her first film, ""The Rose""; Midler is a pretty good singer but Janis Joplin-type songs are not her forte). Most of the other songs made it high up on various charts: ""I Have Nothing"" was #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, ""Run to You"" was #10 on Adult Contemporary, ""I'm Every Woman"" was #1 for Hot Dance Music/Club Play; and ""Queen Of The Night"" was #1 for Hot Dance Music/Club Play.  For four years the album made it to the top spot on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.  If you want more of an explanation for the album's success than Whitney Houston's voice and Kevin Costner's buzz cut, then the variety of charts these songs covered evidences its widespread popularity.  The only serious complaint is that Houston only does the first half of the ablum and the rest is just the sort of filler than usually makes its way onto soundtrack albums in the last decade or so even if having Kenny G, Aaron Neville, and Joe Cocker doing the filling was above average.  But in comparison to the way the album started the second half could not help but suffer in comparison.

The sound quality of the original was pretty good, so I am not sure what could be improved in this ""remastered"" version.  Many regard this album as the best Tull album since the 1970s.  I agree that it is certainly one of the better ones...which isn't that hard since many of them were not very good.  But, is this great?  While there is nothing really bad on the album and most of it is pretty good, there is nothing memorable or stand out about it.  I just played it twice in a row and I still can't remember a song on it....well, not quite true.  The thing is that even though the many of the previous Jethro Tull albums were not spectactular, they still had one or two great, memorable songs.  I think that some of the songs on the CD are still a little bit choppy, featuring a few seconds of a musical interlude and then jumping to something else.  Anderson started toying with the musical style in A Passion Play but really did not fully get into it until Crest of A Knave.  It can take a beautiful song (like he used to write in the beginning of his career) and turn it into something that is not as pleasant to listen to.  Of interest is Wounded, Old and Treacherous, which sounds like Frank Zappa's Montans and Stuck in the August Rain that sounds like something the Dire Straits would do.  This is one Jethro Tull album that I will keep, because I like nearly every song on it. For most every other CD since Thick As a Brick, there have not been enough good songs to keep the whole CD.  I have been ripping the tracks I like and have been putting the CDs in the pile to get rid of.  I have always been a fan of Jethro Tull (but not some albums) and have seen the group every time they are in the area.  They nearly always put on a great live show (except the album Live at the Hammersmith).  One of the first great concerts I saw was the Thick As a Brick tour.

I can't choose any standout tracks, because they are all as good as each other. I too have heard people refer to DKL as nu-metal, and this is absurd.

Greenberg,True,"A few years ago I brought out my aging vinyl copy of George Harrison's masterpiece, ""All Things Must Pass"" from its longtime resting place with my many other hoary sixties' and seventies' era lp's. The reason was that the ten-year-old daughter of a good friend of mine had emerged as a devoted fan of George, this after having abandoned the Spice Girls for the Beatles during the previous six months (yesssss!!)  In an impulsive act of magnanimity, I decided to buy the cd version of the album and then to donate the old vinyl copy to this nascent Harrison fan. Big mistake!  This was not so because I regretted bringing a smile to a little girl's face, but because the quality of the cd remastering of ""All Things Must Pass"" was so very, very awful.  And ""awful"" doesn't come close to capturing the flat, murky, indifferent nature of the mixing that was done the first time the album was put on cd.  Listening to this abomination, I almost cried, and I vowed to write to EMI to ask, nay, BEG them to remaster ""All Things Must Pass."" I'm sure I wasn't the only one to make this request, so I am hardly going to claim credit for the miracle that followed.  But yes, the album has been remastered, and this time they did a fine job, indeed, restoring this complex sonic masterpiece to its original glory, including a fine rendition of the famous Phil Spector ""wall of sound.""  Thank you! Here once again we have all of those musical gems from 1970:  ""My Sweet Lord"" (or is it ""He's So Fine"" remixed, hehe?), ""Isn't it a Pity"" (twice), the delightful ""Apple Scruffs,"" the hypnotic ""Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp,"" and the rave-up masterpiece, ""Awaiting On You All,"" complete with its classic jibe at the Pope (""owns 51% of General Motors"").  Perfection! To top off this wondrous musical development, some additional tracks and rerecordings have been added, including a new mix of ""My Sweet Lord"" that features some gorgeous guitar licks that I can only assume are George's.

1851,619450,AZRK5W6XSHMBR,B000A8AWVE,Uncle Elmer,False,"In this DVD, Pete Best puts forth an argument that basically he got the ""royal shaft"" by the Beatles by getting kicked out on the brink of their success. In essence, he makes his point and the Beatles are found guilty as charged and should be ashamed of themselves. At the least, they should have provided a cut of the profits as to reward Peter for his work and helping them succeed. This peevish act of the Beatles is a smear on a musical legacy.  One comment on some reviewers here who seem to think that Peter Best was holding up the success of the Beatles and that his sacking was neccessary. PUHLEEZEEEE!!! This is rock n roll folks not brain surgery.  As someone who has played drums, if their is some problem a studio guy can get everyone over the hump and eventually the regular drummer can work it out. Look at Hal Baline doing studio work for Dennis Wilson. Was Denny sacked because he wasn't some genius on the drum kit? No, because his brothers loved him and worked with him and he stayed in the band.  Pete Best never should have been sacked and it was a disgrace to have been involved with this mean spirited act.

1852,330465,A5KJVGJ43ZDC9,B000008DA7,Ronald Battista,False,"...Brian Wilson's songwriting with the Beach Boys. This is a depressing and disappointing coda to the Beach Boys' golden age.  The cover is really ominous for the Beach Boys-a sunless, dark blue-hued rendering of what appears to be a vanquished medieval warrior of sorts riding his horse- body sagging, head down, lance down. It's actually quite fitting, since the material inside suggests a tired band in full retreat from the rebellion of the 60s. For example, Bruce Johnston reminisces about the 50s in ""Disney Girls"", and Mike Love counsels everyone to avoid a youth revolution after the events of Kent State. And Brian, well, he's retreating from just about everything at this point, of course. His contributions to the album are placed at the end of the record, as if the other bandmembers were ashamed of the songs. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, since its not like there was a huge contrast between the other brothers' material-no one seems in top form nor particularly happy on this record-the only difference perhaps being Brian wanted to die and pretty much was telling everyone in no uncertain terms on ""A Day In The Life Of A Tree"" and ""Til I Die"".   If you are looking for the Brian signature sound, it comes thru a bit on the final two songs, but only briefly. The rest of the album is spare in instrumentation, with heavy reliance on studio gimmickry to psychedelize the songs...perhaps to mask the substandard composition.  I recommend this album as a document of an end-of-the-60s/dawn-of-the-70s mentality that is somewhat akin to Hunter S.

But, as I listened further into this album and finally finished it--I thought it was okay.  I wouldn't consider this a wasted effort from the boys, because there is too much good material on here to make it a waste. Many reviews I have read on this album elswhere seem to reflect this as a ""disaster.""  Many thought the addition of Joe Lynn Turner was a big mistake.  I'll admit that Turner doesn't fit the Deep Purple mold.  His voice was a stark contrast to Gillan's high pitch--Turner's voice is grittier.  Gillan just seems to have more charisma. But, there is plenty to enjoy on here.  The only things that drag this album down are the bad pop songs--notably ""Truth Hurts,""  ""To Much is Not Enough,"" ""Breakfast in Bed,"" and ""Love Conquers All.""  They are just entirely too moody. The great tracks on here are capped off the by the ultimate symphonic-styled rocker ""Wicked Ways""--which I believe is among the top songs DP ever recorded.  Ritchie's main riff on here is evil.  Another highlight is ""Fortuneteller"" which reminds me of that mid 70's Rainbow sound, making it truly enjoyable.  ""The Cut Runs Deep"" starts out as if it were going to be a shredder, but then fizzles down into a more traditional DP rock tune.  But I must say that Lord and Blackmore's interplay on here is fantastic.  ""King of Dreams"" is a highlight because of its driving opening bass line and ""Fire in the Basement"" is another high point--a great bluesy rocker. What can I say?  It's not a disaster and there are great tunes on here.  I would probably put this on the same level as ""The Battle Rages On"" as far as enjoyability(ranging between 3 and 3 1/2 stars).",3,"12 6, 2000",Truth Hurts...,976060800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},4.0,,"joe mistake tune rainbow admit much pop i'll waste effort thought rock enjoy fire gillan's drive ever level start cap song evil among traditional moody shredder rocker enjoyable blackmore's high many enough open seem big addition great make run contrast initial impression must bass deep breakfast charisma read wicked fortuneteller line put star gillan thing really tune entirely turner love waste stark cut bluesy point--a far gritty material believe go good consider ritchie's boys probably highlight truly fit first remind album riff would symphonic-styled fantastic enjoyability(ranging top dream bed truth track bad conquers disaster mid songs--notably finally voice battle plenty hurt mold pitch--turner's release drag listen sound dp make basement main lynn review interplay purple rage record finish okay reflect seem fizzle ultimate lord it--i ways""--which another say king elswhere"

That didn't mean they did not have good songs and this shows that the critics will sometimes deride anything with the slightest possibility of being successful. Arguably they have done better (the follow-up ""Purple"") and the other four records are more diverse, but this still gets things going strong.  People compare the group to Pearl Jam, but I'd say this record is far more Alice in Chains. A lot of the songs are still played to death on rock radio, but here you also get pretty good songs like ""Piece of Pie"" that the radio doesn't really touch. The pace is changed a bit on other songs, and although most songs here run past five minutes, none of them seem self-indulgent or unnecessary. Still, ""Plush,"" ""Wicked Garden,"" and ""Creep"" were meant to be hits and they are still catchy. The masses are still enjoying it for a good reason: It rocks like it should. Emotion is there. A couple songs change the overall pace here, including the ender, ""Where the River Goes.""

1866,616508,ARCV0CKMSKYU0,B0009ZDJKE,Pranav Chandrasekhar,False,"Six years since his groundbreaking debut, one of Britain's hottest Urban exports Craig David returns with his latest offering - an autobiographical and personal album titled ""The Story Goes"". A spectacular debut can be a boon or a bane. While it definitely helps engrave a musician's position and significance in the world of music, it also lays the foundation for lofty and unrealistic expectations for future musical endeavors. It is the phenomenon that created the term ""sophomore slump"" - something Craig experienced with his last album ""Slicker than your average"". Yet, it has not deterred him and he is still possessed by the will to go on. His fans will be more than glad about this - especially given the results of his most recent effort, which while not stellar, are most certainly substantial.    On ""The story goes"", it appears that Craig has made a deliberate effort to focus almost exclusively on ballads. Some listeners might get the feeling that Craig has taken a ""middle of the road safe"" approach to most of these ballads making them sound like mainstream adult contemporary tracks. While most of them are not instant grabbers, their classic R&B vibes melted with Craig David's smooth voice  most certainly have the potential to grow on listeners in a rather short span of time. The only exception to this is ""Hypnotic"" - Craig's strongest ballad to date - a magical ingredient  to spice up a romantic evening. It is reason enough for listeners to give this album the chance it rightfully deserves.    For those that equate Craig David with high-energy 2-step tracks, this album might not be all that they would have hoped for. The only track reminiscent of the 2-step style that Craig adopted on his successful debut ""Born to Do It"" is ""All the Way"" - a fun, light-hearted and exhilarating  up-tempo track aimed at filling a dance floor. On the other hand, for those that associate Craig David with a powerful voice that keeps him miles ahead of the rest of his R&B contemporaries, this just might be the album they have been secretly waiting for.    Delivering clear-cut verdicts on an album such as this might not be as easy as one would hope for since it does not match the standards of the highly successful ""Born to Do it"" but most certainly provides glimpses for a long musical future for the exceptionally talented Craig David. It deserves a fair chance.

Also on the album are short catchy little rockers (""Dance Little Sister"" and ""Short and Curlies"").  The album closes with a really good groove rocker called ""Fingerprint Files"" and I mine as well mention that the album opens with the perfect hard rockin' ""If You Can't Rock Me"".

While I don't like Al Barr quite as much as the departed Mike McColgan, you can't really go wrong with either of them, and Ken Casey remains an able co-lead vocalist. Fast-paced anthemic numbers predominate on this disc, and I haven't heard a band that can write a catchy anthem quite like the Murphys; witness the addictive energy of ""The Gauntlet"" and ""Heroes of Our Past."" The band, however, augments their punk attack with ample doses of bagpipes, tin whistles, and fiddling. The Murphys also add to their appeal with some meaningful and intelligent lyrics that actually have some relevance to real life. ""The Fortunes of War"" deals with the wars between factions of youths, ""Ramble and Roll"" describes the life of the small-time musician, and ""Caps and Bottles"" exposes the dangers of the hard-living lifestyle that many young people anticipate living. Musically, the album is extremely diverse, with many songs whipping along at breakneck pace, and others slowing things down. The music is strong, with the guitars sounding a little crisper than on previous albums, but still not too refined. I wouldn't call this the best Murphys album, but it still beats pretty much anything you'll find on the airwaves now.

I can think of only two other singers who possess/possessed Ms. Riperton's singing range; Yma Sumac and Mariah Carey. Truly an apt title to her second studio album, ""Perfect Angel, "" Riperton passed much too soon (at 31). But she was courageous, and a fighter. I recollect a time people were shocked after she announced she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer (on The Tonight Show, on August 24, 1976). Later, she continued touring, was the national spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society, and President Jimmy Carter presented her a Cancer Courage Award. Remastered CD is a fitting and loving tribute to this beatiful lady. Interestingly, her best known song, ""Lovin' You"" sounded best. But overall, disc's fidelity is very good indeed.

1881,88858,A3QWNQ2WA7QZYJ,B0000025AE,kireviewer,False,"This is Heart's third album (although many consider it to be their second).  It also might be their third best album.  Nothing can touch their monster debut album, Dreamboat Annie.  And their fourth album, Dog and Butterfly is slightly better than this one.  This album is certainly better than anything they have done after the seventies. This is an album from 1978, so it is just at 40 minutes long.  The sound quality is excellent.  CBS records has always done a wonderful job of putting old records on CD.  (Other record companies have done a horrible job of convertion old records to CD). The ""professional"" reviewer of this record is very far off base.  He writes that this CD is not very accessible.  That is ridiculous, as is all of his other commments.  There were 4 hit singles released from this album. How could that be inaccessible?  This reviewer is obviously a fan of juvenile hard rock and does not like softer or more artistic music. The two best songs on this CD are the accoustic ballad Cry to Me and the rocker Love Alive.  Heart is at its best when it mixes folk music with hard rock.  But there really isn't a bad track on this album.  At the same time there is really no monster track either. This is really Heart's third album.  After Heart released it's first album, Dreamboat Annie, it got into a contract dispute with its record company at that time, Mushroom Records.  Heart's second album, Magazine, was released, and then quickly pulled back.  You could still buy Magazine in Canada.

1884,260785,ALR35EFI69S5R,B000002W4U,Barron Laycock,False,"With a flurry of best-selling rock hits over a short spate of several years, the Canadian group ""Guess Who"" topped the charts and were on the ""A"" list for concerts and gigs. Then, seemingly as quickly as they had burst on the popular music scene at the close of the 1960s, they were gone, evaporated from the scene as the group disintegrated and went in several separate directions at the same time. Yet there is no denying the sheer hit-producing power they possessed, or the magically rock music they left behind as a memory of their brief flirtation with super stardom. Many of their best hits are here, from ""These Eyes"" to ""Laughing"", from ""Undun"" to ""No Time"", from ""No Sugar Tonight"" to ""Hand Me Down World"". Yet, there are many more worthwhile cuts on this collection. Also included here are some provocative lyrics and social commentary, as with both the songs listed above and some of their most memorable work, as in ""Hang Onto Your Life"", Share the Land"", and their most phenomenal and most enduring song, ""American Woman"", which was a thinly disguised broadside at the blatant hypocrisy of American values in the face of the Vietnam War and the widespread social injustice so controversially debated in the late 1960s, about the time of the urban riots across the country. Incidentally, they used the euphemism of the ""American Woman"" to illustrate how Lady Liberty, the Statue of Liberty standing in New York City's harbor, was a hypocritical symbol of an arrogant America gone crazy. It is song that is consistently played, and one many of us hear almost daily. Nice collection of the hits of one of the best groups to have come out of the turbulent sixties.

1887,56774,A1CQCS17LQCHIH,B000001FOL,Jinkyu,False,"Chelsea Girl, Nico's debut album, is made up of pretty songs, dominated by strings and woodwinds, supplemented by soft guitar, and with some interesting arrangements.  Most of the songs were written by by Jackson Browne, who played back-up guitar for Nico at the Electric Circus in New York during the time, and combinations of Nico's then-recent Velvet Underground mates.  Tho Browne was still a teenager, his three very pretty tunes here (the first two tracks and ""Somewhere There's a Feather"") outdo the uneven entries of Lou Reed/John Cale/Sterling Morrison.  ""It Was a Pleasure Then,"" the only song Nico was involved with authoring (she co-authored it with Reed and Cale), reflects a negative aspect of the Velvets, to allow themselves to be self-absorbed in eccentric, drag-on, incoherent stuff (e.g., ""European Son,"" ""Sister Ray""), although the feeling of isolation is evocative.  But in spite of some distinction among songs, Chelsea Girl is above all a coherent, atmospheric album, if not a concept album.  That is, in some way, everything has a similar texture:  a somber but not deep sadness, a beauty that is not exactly dark, evoking perhaps a misty evening in the country, and at the same time having a subtly urban, urbane feel.  I'm not going to engage in the tired-out debate on Nico's voice, except to say it is pleasing to me.  It is rich and pretty, even if somewhat dry, and lyrics are clearly pronounced.

They are completely two different artists, Omarion makes great RnB music and Bow Wow makes barely listenable Rap music (if you can call it that). Don't get me wrong, I love some of Bow Wow's music, but I can honestly say that I have never listened to a whole album of his because I find myself skipping many of the songs.

This solely could be the reason that the topics he raps about are repetitive.

1903,1233759,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00005427R,Tom Brody,False,"BRAHMS PIANO TRIO No. 1 and No. 2 was recorded by Arthur Rubinstein, Henryk Szering, and Pierre Fournier.  The recording is from September 1972.  The sound quality is excellent.  The piano is not muffled at all, and there are no annoying echoes.  Please note that the age of the recording might lead one to wonder about the sound quality.  For example, the Horowitz recording of Schumann's Toccata from the year 1969, available on CBS masterworks, has a sound that is of compromised quality, not unlike music from a radio with marginal reception.  However, the product under review has an excellent sound, so don't worry.  PIANO TRIO No. 1.  ALLEGRO CON BRIO. This begins with a stately theme on piano, which is then reiterated by the cello.  At 45 seconds into the piece, the violin joins in.  At 2 minutes, the pace doubles but only for 20 seconds, and this is followed by a slower interlude that is somewhat aleatory.  At 3 1/2 minutes, the music becomes motoristic and driving, and at 4 min, 15 sec, borders on being thrashing.  At 5 1/2 min, the trio engages in a sustained thrashing effort, and at 6 min, 20 sec, the original stately theme is revived.  At 8 min, 30 sec, the stately theme appears yet again but in a deccelerating manner that gets progressively quieter, and where each instrument provides individualistic flourishes.  ALLEGRO MOLTO.  This begins with a 10-note theme that goes like this: 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4.  There is a little tune that goes with these notes, of course, but the tune just goes up by a note then down by two notes, and then back to the original note.  Although this is not much of a tune, the main point is the slightly ominous quality of the rhythm of the 10-note motif.  At 2 min, 15 sec, the listener is treated to a lovely melody, similar to that of the famed Brahms Lullaby, and here the tune is the main thing (not the rhythm).  At 4 min, 30 sec, the lullaby stops, and the 10-note motif returns.  At 6 minutes, the piano engages in Liberace-like flourishes, with arpeggios sweeping up and down the keyboard  ADAGIO.  In contrast to the first two movements, which are lively, driving, and loud, ADAGIO is quit and the pace is slow.  The music takes the form of pure elegance, and is not encumbered by any tune.  At 2 min, 40 sec, a melody makes its entrance, and it is vaguely reminiscent of SUNRISE, SUNSET from Fiddler on the Roof.  Later, the following motif appears.  The piano provides a series of 4 chords, slowly ascending as if climbing a flight of stairs.  Immediately after each 4 chord ascent, the strings provide a flourish.  ALLEGO.  This begins with the following wistful motif, which is repeated over and over.  The motif is: WHAH-dit-dit-dit-dit, WHAH-dit-dit-dit-DIT, WHAH-dit-dit-dit-DIT.  There is, of course, a tune, but the tune is only two notes going down and then two notes going back up to the original note.  It is not much of a tune, and so the main thing is the rhythm.  (This is not a complaint.)  At 1 min, 10 sec, the motif is repeated but much louder.  At1 min, 20 sec, the listener is treated to a lively melody of astonishing beauty.  At 6 minutes, the original wistful motif makes another appearance, with the same rhythm, but much louder and with a somewhat modified tune.  PIANO TRIO No. 2.  ALLEGRO.  This begins with an awkward tune on cello.  The awkwardness continues for only a half minute.  At 2 min, 50 seconds, begins a distinctive series of piano doublets, sounding like hiccups.  The awkward tune is repeated at 3 min, 30 sec.  At 5 minutes, the listener is treated to a short dramatic interlude.  ANDANTE.  This begins with a tune reminiscent of the opening moments of the song, ""Girl,"" from the Beatles's Rubber Soul album, where the lyrics go, ""Is there anybody going to listen to my story, all about the girl who came to stay?""  At 3 minutes, 55 seconds, the Girl-theme is repeated, but in a strident manner.  At 6 min, 20 sec, the Girl-theme occurs again, but this time it is wistful and gentle.  SCHERZO.  This begins with an appealing jittery motif from the strings, which is accompanied by a nervous rumbling motif from the piano.  Then, the strings provide the jittery motif, but accompanied by arpeggios from the piano, sweeping up and down like Liberace.  At 1 min, 30 sec, the jitteriness is replaced by an engagingly beautiful tune, like yet another version of the Brahms Lullaby.  At 2 min, 30 sec, the lullaby is louder.  At 3 min, 20 sec, the jittery motif returns, along with the nervous rumblings from the piano.  And then, the jittery motif returns, accompanied by sweeping piano arpeggios.  FINALE.  This movement, which is 6 minutes and 53 seconds long, is distinguished by the appearance of the theme from THE SIMPSONS, composed by Danny Elfman.  This is not a complaint.  The similarity is striking.  Simpsons theme occurs at the beginning, and again at 20 seconds, at one minute 50 seconds (in a fragmented form), at 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and at 3 minutes and 47 seconds.  How fun it is to hear the Simpsons theme in this trio by Brahms.  At one minute and 20 seconds comes a brief playful motif, suitable for amusing children.  This playful motif is repeated at 4 min, 50 sec.  At 5 min, 40 sec, the fragment version of the Simpsons theme occurs again, interspersed with dramatic ascending flourishes from the piano.  The following concerns an INVERTED Simpsons theme.  An inverted Simpsons theme occurs at 2 min, 20 sec and again at 6 min, 20 sec.  CONCLUSION.  I have only couple of concluding comments.  RCA Victor has a series of many re-issues, all of them in the format of a comfortable cardboard booklet (no plastic jewelbox) and an essay of some 40 pages long.  This series is called THE RUBINSTEIN COLLECTION.  I own several of these, including the BRAHMS VIOLIN SONATAS, also with Henryk Szeryng.  I recommend exploring all of the available titles.  Some time in the late 1960s, my father took me to see Mr. Rubinstein perform an evening of piano solo pieces in a large auditorium in San Francisco.  All I remember is that it was crowded.  Also, my father took me to a smaller auditorium in San Francisco to hear an evening of guitar music by Andres Segovia.  We sat near the back.  All I remember is looking through my telescope (a small one) because I wanted to count the number of frets on Mr. Segovia's guitar.",5,"04 2, 2015","One of my all-time-favorites from the classical repertoire, along with the Brahms piano quartets and Brahms piano quintets",1427932800,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},3.0,,evening go fragment brief return drive theme come motoristic slow mr interlude strike child many thing opening fragment jittery later note song brio join provide finale fun suitable annoy girl-theme original point double fournier slow thrash couple progressively hiccups violin continue compromise version repeat flight booklet hear explore small inverted masterworks sound crowd main father two scherzo record segovia border instrument comment call stay telescope go year example note small string review replace count essay lyric plastic soul awkward much radio effort rubber like liberace-like sonata pace elfman arthur might product cbs listen interspersed conclude anybody several wistful compose engagingly long echoes rca arpeggio appearance liberace one conclusion elegance astonish reminiscent henryk first ascend strident remember horowitz time rhythm concern engage movement also ominous see solo motif listener deccelerating beatles's distinctive jitteriness yet story include take girl similarity piece fiddler begin record lively tune min flourish distinguish schumann's roof however recommend trio piano cardboard sit stop near jewelbox half victor allego szering wonder slightly quieter contrast reception want individualistic szeryng although music sweeping little course format muffle san movement series quality back vaguely quit similar beautiful sustain take danny aleatory come occurs francisco sunset rubinstein marginal provide form pierre rumble andante stately begin piece along beauty famed sound auditorium con another get amuse climb look awkwardness simpson age perform entrance title lovely keyboard flourish somewhat manner modified adagio reiterate immediately toccata appear complaint sunrise september moment segovia's chord cello whah-dit-dit-dit-dit encumber fret please lullaby minute re-issues unlike gentle appeal pure slowly accompany andres allegro follow go loud large stair ascent comfortable collection minute number sec page album molto melody nervous rumbling playful lead guitar doublet second treated chord short becomes worry louder brahms excellent revive make available dramatic late follow

1910,242944,A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B000002UDN,Rebecca*rhapsodyinblue*,False,"Frank Sinatra chose Axel Stordahl to arrange and conduct this collection of sixteen remarkable ballads that he was so well-known for. These songs were recorded in 1961 except for the last four tracks which were recorded in 1953 and were not included in the original vinyl release.  Any song that the legendary singer recorded became his own and he had left his mark of elegance on each song. To me, that is known as the Sinatra Charisma. Any Sinatra recording is a delight to listen to like this CD, ""Point of No Return."" It's a representation of how excellent he was in interpreting these ballads with superb arrangements by Axel Stordahl, whose works were mainly inspired by the Romantic Era. His arrangements were classically-infused and gentler than the works of other Frank Sinatra arrangers.  Listen closely with your undivided attention to the Chairman's poignantly beautiful and moving rendition of one of the best tracks ""I'll Remember April"" from a trio of songwriters Gene DePaul, Patricia Johnson and Don Raye as he sings this verse...  ""The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes For flames and love live such a little while I won't forget but I won't be lonely I'll remember April and I'll smile""  One of my personal favorites from this collection includes ""These Foolish Things Remind Me Of You.""  ""A telephone that rings But who's to answer Oh how the ghost of you clings These foolish things remind me of you""  I also loved his splendid renditions of ""I'll Be Seeing You, ""As Time Goes By,"" the quintessential love song and theme from the film ""Casablanca"" and ""Memories of You,"" a gem of a song by Eubie Blake & Andy Razaf.  ""Here and there, everywhere Scenes that we once knew And they all just recall Memories of you How I wish I could forget Those happy yesteryears That have left a rosary of tears""  And last but not least, my number one favorite from the pens of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren - ""There Will Never Be Another You.""

Orion had many of the same qualities as Boston, yet they had their own signature sound. Personally, I hear magic in it. Fran Cosmo is virtually AWESOME on lead vocals! If you ever wanted to rate anyone as being comparable to Brad Delp, Fran is THEEE man! So, the beauty here is, this music offers a sound that is Boston's close cousin, but yet with enough originality to not be Boston's clone. At this point in 2008, Boston itself is not able to clone Boston, and their current touring line-up is such a poor attempt to resurrect a legendary band. I want to also make clear that Hirsch Gardner was the producer of Orion The Hunter and just MIGHT be largely responsible for the sound of this production.

1923,1206065,A2JFEBUIADIRDO,B00000J8C1,Derivative Contrivance,False,"EP7 is bizarre. I mean, it's not an EP! If 11 songs cumulatively clocking in at over an hour is an EP, then full-length LP's must be so expansive that only DVD's can contain them. But the oxymoronic misnomer nombre is sensible compared to the music contained within. See that amorphous, ambivalent fractal on the cover? Add colors like heliotrope & mauve, and you have the perfect visual for the music. The music is aural geometry, Pythagorean pentatonics, the harmony of a hypotenuse. It's cosine waves, exponentially polyrhythmic meter, melodic integers. It's the dividend of logic into emotion, the aggregate of a polygon & a polysynth, key signatures as simplified mixed numbers, chord progressions filtered through a prism. Don't try to find the value of X, don't try to round off the square root to the nearest even number. This music is a negative zero, a postulate whose only proof is its own paradoxical existence. It's a syntax error; it does not compute. So just let this rogue antivirus infect every last kilobyte of your databanks. Once you abandon the notion that EP7 is an equation to be solved, you will find that these tunes are inexplicably catchy. If you take it too seriously, every track is as easy as the square root of Pi you will never find a method to the madness. I mean, the bulk of this album was composed by generative synthesis! No, that does not mean that it's all sporadic math blather. What it does mean is that the music is so convoluted that Autechre themselves had to program a computer to play it because the human mind cannot process so much information at such a rapid rate while laying down a track in real time! So just enjoy it! Don't analyze it! I only get off on this tangent to remind you that this is music, not arithmetic, so please treat it as such.  So! EP7 May get tagged as the counterpart to LP5, like who Envane & Cichlisuite are companion EP's to Chiastic Slide, but that's just not so. Once you see EP7 as LP6 instead of an extension of LP5, it's much easier to digest. LP5 is basically a pop album, the standard template for glitch IDM. EP7 is the IDM blueprint diced into word salad. It is an arduous task to commit the structure of these tracks to memory. Thus, it is either infinitely intriguing or intensely infuriating depending on your mood. Sometimes (which is most of the time for me, actually), it is the only thoroughly stimulating album around. Other times (which seems to be most of the time for most other folks, I find, it's a haphazard smattering of slapdash stuttering & stoic stammering that's too experimentally noodling to warrant a listen. People who gripe about Autechre abjectly abandoning musical music for garbled DSP-wankery are referring to this album. I can see how they could assert such harsh allegations. I myself asserted them the first time my ears glanced this album for the 30-second duration of the lofi mp3 samples. But once I actually LISTENED to the entire duration of the 1st 5 songs, my head was boppin'! I was really getting into it! I discovered that in addition to the positively groovy cadences, EP7 is chock full of (gasp!) latently scintillating melodies! They were just a bit obscured by all the hoopla. So...? Anyone who says this album is just a juxtaposition of inhuman racket is really just lazy. Yes, it may take more than a couple spins for this disk to work its voodoo, but that's a bargain price to pay for the payoff that comes when you `get' this album! So come on! Autechre deserves a fair chance! Remember how cool Tri Repetae is? Well, EP7 is at least on par with that now classic album. It's not dancing to architecture, it's dancing to the mos' def hip-hop! Listen to ""Rpeg"", ""Outpt"", ""Dropp"", ""Maphive 6.1"", and ""Pir"". If you can't find the melody in those songs, you probably couldn't find your way out of a paper bag. If you can't find the other songs to be worthy of at least some moderate head-boppin', then you probably couldn't even find your way into the paper bag in the first place. If you find ""Ccec"" to be annoying, however, then your mind apparently hasn't totally rotted out your ears just yet. ""Ccec"" is the only blot I can spot on this otherwise immaculate album. And even then, it's a perfectly groovy song, aside from that confounded blathering vocal sample. And even that vocal sample is fun most of the time, especially when you're completely frustrated and you need to vent. Then I highly recommend blathering along with it. It's a blast!  So the final step in the process of this equation is for me to estimate the tantamount average reaction to this album. My conclusion? EP7 = difficult squared. But as any avidly voracious consumer of fine music knows, the most difficult songs to stomach are often the most rewarding. Just have patience! Someday you will see the absence of light that is EP7.   Now, for those who are still reading, I have a reward: I shall now do a concise track-by-track analysis because I feel this review has hitherto been kinda vague. So... ""Rpeg"" is straight-up squelchy hip-hop driven by a melody played on a synth patch that can only be described as a ""robo-Oboe"". ""Ccec"" sounds like a maniac has hijacked the intercom in a tarmac, and is blathering while paranoid glitch-hop is accompanying him in the background. ""Squeller"" is similar in melodic structure to the restless chord progression of ""Vose In"" from LP5. The only difference is the beat in ""Squeller"" is much funkier and the percussion sounds sound like a recording of a NASA control station hub going haywire because someone spilled coffee on the main terminal. ""Left Blank"" sounds like an interactive control pad in a flight simulator cockpit chirping with delight as its buttons are pressed. ""Outpt"" is propelled by a beat that actually has a groovy swing to it. For some reason, it sounds like the kind of song they would play before a futuristic Olympic event, it's very driving, and it swaggers with self-assurance. I suppose it could be the ""We Will Rock You"" of the future. ""Dropp"" begins with a slightly mordant melody that is promptly swallowed by vicious onslaught of steam pistons trying in vain to completely engulf the downtrodden melody. But the melody prevails! Kind of a triumphant track, in it's own low-key way. ""Liccflii"" sounds like the themesong to a stowaway running for his life down labyrinthine corridors to evade the ship's security patrol, who are hot on the trail of their quarry because he leaves a distinctly foreign scent. At the end of the song, the alien security guards corner the stowaway and devour him. Seriously, it's nowhere near as terrifying as it sounds, because Autechre puts us in the perspective of a series of cameras on the wall, who are just indifferent witnesses to the chase. ""Maphive 6.1"" starts with gigantic drums being beaten as a melody flits about like a fly. The track gradually chills out, until all that is left is the fly buzzing around the marimba player. Yes, this track contains a marimba, even if it is synthetic. It's a very upbeat track, very fun to dance to. And probably the most danceable track on the album... ""Zeiss Contarex"" sounds like a field recording of the inside of a UFO hangar. Spacecraft depart & return all throughout the track as a bored mechanic fiddles with a radio until he finds a station broadcasting the most preposterous sample of a Japanese lady gabbing. It must be heard to be believed. ""Netlon Sentinel"" contains the most pummeling percussion on the album. It sounds like a starcraft factory. The melody is often as glitchy as the beat, but it still somehow manages to be one of the prettiest on the album. ""Pir"", the closer, is absolutely stunning. Yes, the beat is garbled to the point of nearly arrhythmic ruckus, but that soaring melody! That majestic bass! It's beautiful. And it should be proof enough for anyone that this is not music for robots or people devoid of souls. It's very soulful. And you would've missed out on it, had you never given EP7 a chance. I told you it was worthwhile!  Hmm... That's all, I suppose.

These pieces must be studied to be fully appreciated.  I don't mean studied as in analysed to figure out exactly how Booth & Brown made the sounds; that is nearly impossible, even knowing a few things about sound.  By study I mean attentive listening.  That can be a challenge, as Confield's tracks are demanding on one's attention span. Vi Scose Paise's lightly drumming rhythms open the album suddenly but not startlingly, then after a minute or so a quiet melody peeps in the back door and turns on some lights.  It never asserts itself, which makes it all the more appealing.  When finally the drumming stops, it gives way to a new percussive melody.  At first it sounds like electronic jazz, until the fourth note.  This is Cfern, and it has no idea where it's going.  Just the same, it wanders around, and you're welcome to follow it. Through corrugated sloshing beats and strange melodic and harmonic tapestries, Confield takes the listener on a joyride in a bumper car with no driver.  Not only is it a challenge to dance to, it's even a challenge to make sense of it all.  Ultimately, after the fun is over and one awakes from the hour-long meditation, there is an overwhelming urge to push the ""play"" button just once more.

1929,539823,A3Q83VI243WI7U,B0000A0DRX,Michael Topper,False,"The 1996 remaster of this album--my second favorite of all time, after The Beatles' ""Revolver""--was pretty good, with most of the relevant artwork, good liners and good sound quality, so it would seem the only reason to get this new edition is for the new liner notes (which are slightly more comprehensive) and the five bonus tracks.  The bonus tracks *are* a delight, for they complete this masterpiece at last.  The expansive, epic 11-minute live ""Ballad Of You And Me And Pooneil"" (with a longer feedback intro, incredible vocal gymnastics and greatly extended bass/guitar jamming) is the same as that found in the ""Loves You"" box from '92, but in much better sound quality; plus, it's nice to have it on the same disc as the rest of the album.  The same goes for the mono ""Martha"" b-side, also originally reprinted on the box set--which is then followed by three completely unreleased gems, including an alternate ""Two Heads"" with a different vocal take, a gorgeous acoustic demo of ""Things Are Better In The East"" (the electric version having found its way onto the box set) and a nice instrumental run-through of the aforementioned ""Young Girl Sunday Blues"" as a hidden bonus at the very end (and, as the review below mentioned, with some great stereo effects; one can more fully appreciate the band's famed psychic sense of interplay without the vocals here).  This is about as comprehensive a clearing of the vaults as there has ever been for this album, which has been done for all of the Airplane albums in the new remaster series (I plan on getting ""Crown Of Creation"" next, and will hopefully be able to now hear the oft-bootlegged ""Saga Of Sidney Spacepig"" outtake for the first time!). However, this new version gets docked a star for its sound quality.  Interestingly, the bonus cuts sound crisper than the album itself--the original master tapes seem to have deteriorated slightly since the '96 version, because I hear some very slight, but still noticeable, background hiss and static that was not there previously (this is most noticeable on the first ""suite"", but then goes away after ""rejoyce""), and the volume levels have not been improved (I still have to turn my player way up to hear this one  decently--and by ""decently"", I mean VERY LOUD, which is the only way this album should be heard!).  I will abstain from a more detailed review of this wonderful, magical work--which combined elements of their previous classic ""Surrealistic Pillow"" with ""Sgt. Pepper"", The Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, Hendrix and Cream to create as close an approximation of the density and intensity of the acid experience as has ever been put on record, recorded smack in the middle of the Summer Of Love--as I already have a lengthy review of it for the old remaster. Suffice to say that the album is worth it for ""rejoyce"" alone, Grace Slick's finest hour and one of the greatest pop songs of all time.  Because of the minor static problems, though, it would seem that one should actually retain their copy of that '96 version if one desires to hear the album in the best possible sound quality, but still pick up the latest one (which, to be fair, is being sold at a discount price in most outlets) for the liners and, especially, the 25 minutes or so of bonus tracks.  Also recommended is the new remaster of ""Pillow""--which, unlike ""Baxter's"", has been significantly improved in sound as well as the addition of bonus cuts--and Jeff Tamarkin's new and comprehensive bio of the group, ""Got A Revolution!"", which manages to vividly recount the heady atmosphere of the late 60s and 70s in which the band thrived.",4,"10 3, 2003","5 stars for the album, 4 for the remaster",1065139200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},16.0,,"player significantly go onto star acid hiss retain ever lengthy disc hear actually delight young last problem decently--and get favorite cream vividly different note artwork discount density gems turn original possible revolution suffice airplane hour heady version oft-bootlegged would hear track late docked band summer sound hidden demo volume experience head plus extended improve set two record revolver""--was mean without interestingly greatly previously reprint do review away slick's much jeff unreleased vocal sell liner noticeable martha beatles group approximation effect alternate element acoustic tape well minor liner bass/guitar intro one new love--as deteriorate electric suite bonus pillow worth gorgeous first work--which time sidney also run-through still bio five incredible album appreciate interplay since classic intensity old expansive magical though include girl saga originally three remaster manages spacepig slight ballad second nice vocal edition decently longer sunday b-side jamming creation however songs create next clearing pink surrealistic take desire album--my slightly itself--the vault middle find box thing dead combined series quality smack relevant recount sense crown able good fine gymnastics thrive alone get background baxter's level close static plan masterpiece blue abstain rejoyce tamarkin's best famed previous wonderful pillow""--which well say get grace master pop way completely outtake aforementioned cuts--and hendrix pick recommend addition great already set--which minute east unlike put great record floyd stereo crisper atmosphere epic comprehensive reason live follow mentioned grateful loud detailed price copy fully pepper love hopefully especially album fair mono psychic instrumental complete sgt rest feedback outlet cut pooneil band's seem end get late pretty"

Having admitted my bias, I must also state that I have yet to listen to this box set in depth to assess its artistic merits when compared to other performances of the same works. I have, however, sampled each disc for sound quality and, simply put, this set is a monument to the beauty of the ""Decca sound"" in all of its 1950's mono glory.  Decca recording technology of the post-war period was so far ahead of the curve that it left most other recording companies in the dust. This was largely due to the fact that the British millitary was given access to top secret patents which were used to produce advanced sonar circuits used by the Allies during World War II--patents which were eventually released to Decca after the war for use in commercial sound recording circuitry--with much of the recording equipment produced in-house by the great Decca engineering staff. The results of this superior technology can be heard in these recording, as well as other magnificent Decca mono and stereo recordings of the period--many of which have rarely been surpassed--even in the current digital era.  The outstanding resolution, transperancy, sense of space and depth, and superior microphone placement, assign these recordings to a revered place in the pantheon of post-war grammophone recordings. One quickly forgets that these recordings are not stereo--because it simply doesn't matter. The 24/96 remasterings are lovingly executed, superb by any standard.

However, it is a pleasure to hear Carreras in his sadly very short prime, singing with feeling and never trying to sing this music like it were Puccini.

I'm a guy on the doorstep of 40 and I actually like both of her records! Her 2007 debut, ""Don't Forget"", was a very enjoyable pop/rock record that showed a sense of Adult Contemporary maturity that is lacking in the sound quality of her Disney Channel counterparts such as Miley Cyrus (although I do enjoy some of her songs), her real-life BFF Selena Gomez, and Ashley Tisdale. Let it also be known that in terms of vocal talent, Lovato appears to be the best among the four.  On her second effort, 2009's ""Here We Go Again"", she continues to expand on her ever-growing maturity in terms of sound and production. The songwriting is simple but effective, which gives it that unique balance of being a record that your young daughter would sing along to, but you'll find yourself dancing along with. With remarkably catchy songs that highlight her apparent four-octave range (?), both of her albums appear to be a hybrid of Tween Pop sensitivity & Adult Contemporary maturity.  Clocking in at just over 46 minutes over 14 tracks, the album's opener, the title track, is a rockin' cut that could've done without the final cymbal crash at the very end. ""Solo"", ""U Got Nothin' On Me"", ""Everything You're Not"", & ""World Of Chances"" are solid, thoroughly enjoyable tracks that are just comfortable to hear. ""Catch Me"" & ""Gift Of A Friend"" are outstanding slow ballads, but ""Everytime You Lie"" is the standout song here, a wonderful slice of R&B/Jazz-tinged pop that could be easily used in a party/club scene in a TV series like ""Melrose Place"", ""90210"", or the now-departed ""The O.C."".  As the primary star of [the Disney Channel Original Series] ""Sonny With A Chance"", it's only fitting the album closes with the show's theme song ""So Far So Great"". The sing-songy arrangement is a bit daunting, but this girl gives it a spirited ""YEOOWWWW"" at the end and redeems it nicely. But Lovato deserves a lot of credit for being able to hold this record together with a vocal range that seems to be beyond her 17 years of age (as of this writing). Yeah, she's no Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey or even Beyonce' and she's not trying to be. Truth be told? She's not SUPPOSED to be .... and she SHOULDN'T be!!!  Take into account that both ""Don't Forget"" & ""Here We Go Again"" were released by a major label (Hollywood Records) NOT affliated with Disney. That speaks volumes about the impression they had about Lovato's talent and the sound she managed to create a mere two records in. Solid and consistent, ""Here We Go Again"" is just an infectious, catchy, and just plain comfortable record. Her vocal talent & sound will mature with age and that should be expected. When that does happen, it's possible she'll give the aforementioned ladies a run for their money.

1949,161366,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,B000002HRF,Paul Lawrence,False,"The story goes that much of the material for this release was written around the time of the Load sessions and certainly there is a constant vein throughout. So if you liked Load then you'll probably like this given it has a similar feel and the songs have familiar structures. And a number of interesting things are tried here such as the inclusion The Unforgiven II, a sequel to the bands hit The Unforgiven from the black album. And while it has been done before by bands Metallica are perhaps to be lauded for revisiting a lyrical theme so openly, to try to take the story further.  Further kudos are warranted for the fact that the band stuck to their guns in the face of some not unjust criticism of the Load album, the band quite clearly believing that these songs had a purpose and deserved to be aired in a formal release, as opposed to the inevitable inclusion in some latter day `from the vault' style release.  The long and the short of it is however that the band are wrong. These are not important, nor overly worthwhile songs and the simple fact is that given that most of these songs were apparently done in the same writing sessions and yet didn't make the Load album - that kind of tells you something doesn't it. This is the second rate songs from those writing sessions dressed up and send to an unloving and underwhelmed public and the few outstanding tracks are mercifully at the start of the album; Fuel - the nearest thing to a blazing mindless good time track on the album; The Memory Remains - which rides a slow and pounding riff which threatens critical mass and, well, that's about it really.

Bis succeeds amazingly where Garbage fails miserably. If you have been a long term fan of Bis, you will welcome the songs you hear on this album.  Sure the tempos are slower, there is more restraint here than ever before.  But Bis proves they can play it cool without losing anything. You can hear true artistic growth in these songs. I thought I'd be disappointed when I learned that Manda Rin would be doing fewer lead vocals this time around.  But the shared vocal work is great.

1966,899893,A3UWABJ3RUDZ3E,B006YH1U7U,J. Loudon,False,"After changing their name from Jabroni Sandwich in the spring of 2009, Surfer Blood generated a great deal of hype in the months that followed leading up to the release of Astro Coast, their debut album. On December 14, 2009, Pitchfork even listed Surfer Blood's lead single, ""Swim (to reach the end),"" as number thirty-seven on their list of the 100 best tracks of 2009.  Although Surfer Blood's name and the occasional use of a tremolo pedal might put them up against bands like the Beach Boys, the majority of their album is straight up indie rock. Every song seems to have glimpses of the beach, but their overall sound is much more complex. Astro Coast opens with ""Floating Vibes,"" an incredibly catchy pop track which presents the surfer influence briefly halfway through with the use of heavy reverb and Dick Dale stylistic picking before returning to the fuzzed out guitar and driving drums that make the song memorable. There seems to be a heavy Silversun Pickups influence in the guitar tone which works exceptionally well for this song. The same influence is also present on the ninth track, ""Anchorage.""  The first single ""Swim"" follows ""Floating Vibes"" with what I can only describe as Animal Collective meets Weezer's ""blue album."" Every song on the album appears to pull ideas from a different band so it's no wonder this song led Surfer Blood to be instantly described as ""Weezer-esque"" without having heard anything else on the record. Vocals saturated with reverb lead the way on what will no doubt be a crowd favorite when performed live.  The final clear influence that can be heard in Surfer Blood's music is Vampire Weekend. This comparison is most easily drawn from the tracks, ""Take It Easy"" and ""Fast Jabroni."" It's possible fans of Vampire Weekend may shun Surfer Blood's music on account of being too similar, but the album as a whole successfully blends so many styles that I still consider this an incredibly successful debut. With a nod to David Lynch on ""Twin Peaks"" and the word ""jabroni"" in two of their track names, it's clear they wanted to let their fans know a little about them and how they got their start. They're young and still fairly new at making music together so I have no doubt they will only improve from here on out. Look for them to take the college market by storm this year.

1977,609854,A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B0009IFEJ0,Chandler,False,"Common (Sense) latest album ""Be"" was possibly one of the biggest hip-hop albums in 2005. In my opinon it was a little overrated, but at the same time, it held it's own. Eleven tracks deep, Common was trying to stay real with his older fans, but at the same time trying to attract newer ones (yeah...you people who never liked him up until this album then say you were down since ""Ressurection""...shut up). Well there is not too much I can say about this album that hasn't been said.  Common hooked up with Kanye West who produced the majority of this album. Many tracks he does a good job on, like the two singles ""The Corner"" and ""GO!"". Common uses his introspective side of himself on most of this album, and it would show on the last song ""It's Your World"", and the title track ""Be"". My favorite track is the song ""Love Is"" which is backed by a teriffic beat. And you can hear Common regain his strength like on earlier albums on the song ""Chi City"".  Now what holds this back from being a 9 or a 10 out of 10 (or a 4.5 or 5 star album), are a few things. First, I believe 11 tracks is kinda short on an album for Common (his shortest album to date). Not necessarly a bad thing, but fans would want to hear more. Second ""The Food"" from the Dave Chapelle show. I was suprised the fact that it was on this album (I guess he wanted to give Dave some love on this album), although the origonal song was recorded months before the album was released. Also they shortened the song too. And to be honest, I wasn't feeling the song ""They Say"" with John Legend and Kanye in my opinion.  Overall Common dropped a dope album in 2005. I'm glad to see that he gets the love that he deserves, although I really didn't approve of the move too much (on the song ""Doonit"" from his ""Like Water For Chocolate"" album, he said he didn't care much for charts, but five years later he was aiming for them). This album is enjoyable by all, and if you don't have it, I recommend this to you. It's one enjoyable album mostly from start to finish.

1981,1438514,A3L9FT8OJY4Q6I,B0151T70UC,Stuart Jefferson,True,"""None of Graham's tribe wanted to be part-timers, doing one or two gigs a week and having a day job.  They embraced the road and stayed on it for the duration.  And to achieve that they always gave 100%.""  The four ""star"" rating is for the performances--not the sound quality--which is rough in spots on this approximately 4 1/2 hours set.  Included are Bond's BBC stuff,  including things like an hour long jam session from '62.  If you're familiar with the previous box set of Bond's music you'll know pretty much what to expect sound-wise.  But Graham Bond was a large piece of the musical foundation in Britain during those formative years in the '60s for so many musicians who went on to form important bands.  Hopefully this set will become more widely  available soon for those wanting to take the  plunge.  Last minute ""finds""/additions kept this set from being released as originally scheduled.  You'll also occasionally hear the voice of  a BBC ""presenter"" (including John Peel)  between tunes introducing a song.  Some people may find that irritating but I like it because it adds a note of period authenticity--as if you've somehow been transported back in time and are sitting in front of your radio in your front parlor.  This box set  (not tall packaging like the first set) is produced by the same people (notably poet Pete Brown) who brought us the previous Bond set, so it has  the  feel of that earlier set.  The two jewel cases slip inside a thin cardboard slipcase and each case has a thick booklet with two discs with track information in one booklet and great period photos and ephemera in the other booklet.  And while I'm a big fan of Bond's music and his various bands I do have to say that the sound is at times perhaps rougher (Disc 2 tracks 11-14 are from a bootleg of a ""Pop Goes The Beatles"" show from 1963)  than the previous box set.  But this era of British music was the beginning  for a lot of  the many musicians who passed through or were influenced by Bond, and is so important to what a lot of British groups did later.  I still remember when Bond played with another British legend, Alexis Korner (check out his blues albums) in the group Free At Last, which is where (thanks to Korner)  Rodgers, Kossoff,  Kirke, and  Fraser got their band name, Free.  A few highlights:  Disc 1 begins in 1963 with a BBC ""Jazz Club"" set with John McLaughlin on guitar and Bob Breen on vocals, plus four tunes with vocalist  Duffy Power and again includes Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  There's also a BBC broadcast from '62 with Don Rendell which features the great  Dick Heckstall-Smith on a couple of tunes with Bond on alto sax trading riffs.  Disc 2 has Ginger Baker-drums, along with Heckstall-Smith and trumpeter Mike  Falana on tunes like (a Bond favorite) ""Wade In The Water"", and ""Only Sixteen"", plus some improvisation from Heckstall-Smith and Bond's latest group, the Graham Bond Initiation also doing ""Wade In The Water"".  But as with many live tapes from this early period the sound is far from great, but it's the closest we'll get to Bond's early live stuff.  Disc 3 is all Graham Bond Initiation with a couple of BBC sessions from the John Peel Show and ""Top Gear"".  This edition of his band was actually a pretty good group of musicians which you can hear on these tapes.  Disc 4 has a rare EP track from 1962, (the ""Jazz and Twist"" EP), which I've only heard about until now.  Plus there's a session with Brian Dee's Trio that features Graham Bond, and Bond with pianist Joe Palin from a rehearsal tape which shows another dimension to Bond and music from that era.  Obviously this set isn't for someone new to Bond's music--for that check out his studio albums (""The Sound Of 65"", ""There's A Bond Between Us"", and ""Solid Bond"") which have better sound and will give the new listener a good idea of what his music was like.  Similar to the previous box set there's  a few rough spots which are far from good sounding--even for fans (like me) who want to hear Bond's music from the period when he had a number of great players in his bands.  Much like some collections of old blues music you have to get past the sonic anomalies as best you can and concentrate on the music.  This set is for those who really want to go back in time when British rock, blues, soul, r&b, and jazz was new and exciting, and musicians were beginning to combine various genres into an exciting new sound.  And Graham Bond was at the forefront of jazzy, bluesy, rock music, (along with Mayall and his slavish devotion to blues music), and gave so  many up and coming musicians a chance to play music in a newer direction.  This is one part of  where it all happened.  Heavily influenced by American jazz, blues, and r&b, included here are songs like ""Everyday I Have The Blues"" (Peter Chatman--known as Memphis Slim), Hallelujah"", ""What'd I Say"", ""I Got A Woman"" (Ray Charles), ""Kelly Blue"" (Wynton Kelly), ""Oleo"" (Sonny Rollins), ""Sack 'O Woe"", ""Things Are Getting Better"", ""Work Song"" (Cannonball Adderley), plus ""I Saw Her Standing There"" (The Beatles), and songs by Bond and others.  There's a lot of exciting performances included here--especially if you like that era of British music.  A number of these performances have the band really working out on these tunes.  Check out Bond's organ playing, or Heckstall-Smith's sax blowing, or the Jack Bruce/Ginger Baker rhythm section, or some of the unknown (to American jazz fans)  jazz players who are all over these BBC sets.  All in all, ultimately, a nice addition to Bond's discography and some great listening for fans.",4,"10 23, 2015",BOND'S BBC RECORDINGS--FOR DEEP FANS WHO WANT TO SWING.,1445558400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},5.0,,"power r&b go jack i've star ephemera legend stand influence rehearsal player mayall disc heard actually dee's ep time last tall get favorite many expect happen later song direction jazzy really heckstall-smith's occasionally part close far we'll soon kossoff session britain couple hour kelly stuff schedule information booklet hear familiar track sack late anomaly water band tribe sound idea ultimately release forefront show plus spot saw set two plunge chatman--known go slavish british note may know case give performance palin soul much radio rock peel none bootleg pianist sonic riff like vocal woman transport baker-drums duffy section week four beatles group mclaughlin sounding--even photo name club brown musical tape well long thick parlor slip bbc one new sax unknown dick fraser pass become first remember band add time rhythm various alexis top also rougher group falana here--especially still charles voice inside organ trade year road listener ginger case album play pretty old peter include kirke new there's originally always begin pete give joe nice wade play edition work bring jam foundation hour trio cardboard john song rodgers music--for others job important brian take big everyday rendell want fan hallelujah obviously go trumpeter genre box music broadcast thing dimension set lot back rough american highlight similar presenter free good graham approximately finds""/additions sit poet graham's early produce perhaps get rollins check vocalist somehow period form front keep blue heavily rating introduce bond's performances--not begin piece i'm best work along previous come session memphis jewel say another bruce discography part-timer want track blow initiation wynton stay pop bruce/ginger chance find breen gear packaging devotion sonny thanks twist someone ray quality--which addition great solid korner feel sixteen gig notably achieve early concentrate improvisation tune formative include rare play bluesy bob live baker bond duration large heckstall-smith alto minute number want studio thin woe listen adderley sound-wise hopefully exciting disc blue irritate fan day musician guitar slipcase widely mike combine oleo cannonball include authenticity--as embrace slim people jazz available past get show collection tape what'd era feature"
1982,1118048,A1F89OE7BAM7EL,B0000027AN,Ralph Moore,False,"I love so many of the issues in the Sony ""Essential Classics"" series featuring Ormandy and the Philadelphia, not least because the sound is so spectacular, not just for recordings made fifty years and more years ago; goodness knows what one, lone reviewer found to moan about in his review headed ""terrible recording"". The other dependable is the sheer virtuosity of the Philadelphians; the orchestral playing here is luscious, right from the sweetest of solo violin solos from Anshel Brusilow in the opening of ""Sheherazade"". Ormandy could by all accounts be routine on the podium live, but so many these recordings are first class.  I also love two accounts of the main piece by Stokowski, with the RPO and the LSO (on Cala) but I'm not sure this one is very different: all are grand, large-scale events which don't put much store by superfluous subtlety but let the bands sing out, making a glorious sound. I bought this issue for virtually nothing plus p&p because I wanted a good account of the ""Capriccio espagnol"", somehow absent in my collection - and I got what I wanted: a thoroughly energised, brilliantly coloured performance, with excellent balances between the succession of riffs from instrumental soloists and the concerted orchestra passages. Rimsky never sounded more like like Tchaikovsky in the textures and effects he demands here; this is ""heart-on-the-sleeve"" stuff, delivered with sincerity and unabashed indulgence.  In fact none of three pieces here is especially demanding music and withstands the gung-ho approach and lush sonics given them.

1985,913068,A269Y1XB5ZFA6L,B0083YRT4U,Mr JB,False,"Carmen recordings are one of those subjects on which there never will be a total unity among the reviewers. It's one of those operas you are likely to have heard already in your childhood, and I think what you've heard then is somehow a guide for your taste when you grow older. Often you find reviewers arguing for one specific recording and throwing every other in the garbage bin. I'll try to avoid too much of that...  The Berliner Philharmoniker starts the whole opera, under the baton of Simon Rattle, with an impressive beauty of sound, and a better sense for french music than I had expected - probably to do with the fact that Rattle has been more and more interested in french music lately. Still not as french as the ONRF under Beecham in his famous recording, or the orchestra of the opera comique under Cluytens, but those are old recordings and the sheer beauty of the sound and the sound quality is far superior in this live recording. Rattle presses rather hard at times,  but he still has a nice grip of the score, and he's great in presenting the melodrama, using his trademark tempo changes to great effect. Rather the same can be said about the chorus - it sounds great for most of the time, but not very french in style.  I don't think anyone will ever buy a new recording of Carmen, however, with the conductor as the sole reason. And this is where the problems with this recording begin. Magdalena Kozena, a mezzo I own several recital discs of, whom I very higly admire, was an unexpected choice for me as Carmen, and, unfortunately, is the main reason for me not giving this recording 4 or 5 stars instead of two.  She does, and I much admire any singer who does this, bring us a non-clich Carmen - there's not even a suggestion of overtly erotic singing. There are singers who has done this before, and still has managed to make us belive that this is a woman every man would notice and whish for, no matter when or where he saw her. The first two who comes to my mind are Victoria de los Angeles (Beecham) & Theresa Berganza (Abbado). For those wanting more obviously sexy Carmens you have Migenes (Solti) and Price (Karajan) to name just a few. Kozena's beautiful voice is displayed well here, but lacks the warmth needed, and her acting is to simpleminded. When she's mocking Don Jos in Act 2, she just sounds angry and intimidated - never a suggestion of anything that would infuse Jos with any fear and even less insanity. Another example of Kozenas shortcoming is the final scene of the whole opera, where she screams at Jos in a way that makes you think that she's the one who's lost her mind, not Jos. Actually, Kozenas interpretation makes me think of Mim rather than Carmen. I could give more examples, but I rest here, for I highly admire almost every other aspect of what she's done before.  Let's instead turn to Jonas Kaufmann. This is one of his best roles. He gets terrified, pulsates, softens, despairs and finds a vocal nuance for every other feeling you could possibly ask for from Jos. His interpretation here is better than when I heard him a few years ago in a broadcast from Milan, his Jos is now a real character, not just a mix of hot feelings. And the quality of the voice itself is as usual one to die for. Just listen to his crescendo from pp to mf, and the a little back again, on his high Bb ""toi"" at the end of the flower song. Few tenors in the world have managed something as beautiful as this. And probably noone on record.  The singleminded, gruff character Escamillo should, just as Carmen, suggest a threat to Jos, someone just as virile as Jos, and with far better self esteem. Kostas Smoriginas has much to recommend himself in terms of voice, although he lacks a little heft in the lower register, and he never presents a real threat to Jos, nor in the Torreador song, not in their duel.  Genia Kuhmeier as Micaela is the other obvious success of the recording. She has a firm, yet rich, very feminine soprano voice that suits Micaelas character perfectly, and she uses it intelligently. Not since the days of Freni has Jos's stupidity in chosing Carmen instead of his mother's whish, been so obvious.  The minor roles are all very well taken. In fact I more than once played with the thought that Christian van Horn, the Zuniga, could have switched roles with Escamillo. Before I end, it must be said that this recording is of the Oeser edition, including dialogue. I'm not very fond of this in recordings, it fares better in the theatre, I think. Since the singers aren't french, this makes for some strange sounds, but on CD you can always skip as much as you like with the remote.  Overall good conducting, good minor roles, superb Jos and Micaela. My favourite Carmen is Beecham's old recording with de los Angeles & Gedda, with Abbado's and Cluytens' sets close on second place. There actually is rather a bunch of good Carmens out there, but this one can only in parts compete with or win over them.",2,"08 30, 2012",50% Great,1346284800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},23.0,,crescendo present guide reviewer manage interpretation taste oeser notice scream who's ever fear smoriginas say start kozena's hear actually try garbage time mim problem los christian possibly song superior role singer star orchestra belive torreador turn success solti far singer almost highly would pulsate angeles ago bin melodrama sound beecham's main superb press saw overall two jos mezzo example do every feeling give hard score opera much carmens think remote fare magdalena recording like sheer singleminded woman unexpected could character usual berganza berliner listen chosing several name whish mother's well unfortunately carmen minor suggest french obvious one soften new term change beecham whole impressive abbado's jos's likely strange win perfectly non-clich day self let's effect first gruff angry noone gedda time terrified sole give buy cd still voice year childhood rich simon scene choice jonas style since die mocking yet old nuance include virile admire there's flower ask throw use always heft infuse lower soprano he's rather second record nice tenor vocal play i'll edition milan comique however recommend suggestion skip kostas among operas freni think hot conductor victoria aspect anyone kozenas act despair must kaufmann lately obviously less although higly music little broadcast set fond quality back pp conduct place sense beautiful act good suit van come mind cluytens part shortcoming close horn toi firm somehow micaelas unity find man zuniga de make bb avoid i'm tempo best present often duel trademark beauty overtly specific bunch theresa karajan esteem rattle display well micaela expect another get final kozena want find threat onrf way lack register example feeling baton someone erotic intelligently world warmth recital philharmoniker simpleminded high migenes something great already take real begin kuhmeier interested stupidity grow record fact insanity need theatre sexy favourite feminine live reason sound lose singing probably dialogue price escamillo disc argue even matter rest mix subject never bring switched mf chorus abbado total instead intimidated end genia make compete famous old anything use grip

Osowski,False,"Given the consistenly high level of music Hank Williams produced in his brief recording career, pretty much any Hank compilation is bound to be great (unless it's a botched reissue or it features unwelcome overdubs).  However, this is the one Hank disc I'll probably end up listening to the most (I also have the superb ""Ultimate Collection"" and the Proper (UK) issues).  Why?  First, I actually like its brevity.  True, the CD is barely half full (just over 40 minutes), but its length makes it perfect to listen to in one sitting (or one drive).  It doesn't hurt that I picked it up for only a buck here on Amazon.  Second, it features a nice balance between full band recordings and solo demos (in my opinion, some of Hank's most poignant work).  Third, and most important, the song selection is, for my money, perfect.  I'm yet to hear a Hank song that I don't like, but all of the songs here are personal favorites, such as ""Ramblin' Man,"" ""Lost Highway,"" ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,"" ""Weary Blues from Waitin',"" and the devastating ""Angel of Death.""  It's also a nice touch that the lyrics are reprinted in the booklet.

1995,406019,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B00004SGUT,Chris &#039;raging bill&#039; Burton,False,"Although I'm into faster metal than this such as death and black (eg. Satyricon, Cradle Of Filth, early Entombed) or the more melodic power metal (Iron Maiden, Blind Guardian, Queensryche), I do still like this album. I wouldn't say I listen to it a great deal due to personal taste, but it certainly is an album I felt I should review. If it's great guitar work you want, then you're looking in the right place. Zakk Wylde is a guitar god - without a doubt one of the best, not just of his generation, but in music ever. He can play unbelievably fast, AND he can do all of this stuff live when he's jumping around. Being a mere mortal, I find it hard to recreate even a relatively simple riff when I'm pogo-ing around, never mind a lead that is faster than most can do sitting down. Then there's the songs. As I said, they're not particularly fast, so it that's what you're looking for then look elsewhere. But if it's sludgy stoner metal you want, then Zakk serves up exactly the right menu. The best songs include Phoney Smiles And Fake Hellos, 13 Years Of Grief and Counterfeit God. There also two really good ballads, Rust and Just Killing Time. It seems that most people prefer Rust, but I would have to go with amazingly touching Just Killing Time. But if you want ballads, you may want to look at Book Of Shadows, my personal favourite of Zakk Wylde's albums, and also by far his most different.

1999,833638,A2NA6VPXNOY5LR,B00317CO3K,Jonathan,False,"Adam Lambert's debut was highly anticipated, far more than Kris Allen's, the winner of American Idol. Fans were curious to see where he would take his music, since it seemed he had artistic control over the project. What Adam gives the masses is truly strong album of pop that also delves a bit into arena rock, theater, and adult contemporary, all crafted into a cohesive artistic statement, even without a general theme.  The album couldn't have begun better than with Music Again, bursting with energy and popping with joy. The rest of the album suffers slightly because of it, as there is no equivalent later in the track listing. However, the rest of the songs show such range that it's difficult to criticize. The five ballads on the album are spaced well, with mid- to up-tempos weaved amongst them, though never too jarring. Adam's voice is the greatest instrument on the album, be it when he wails on the chorus of the stomping Strut, restrains his vocals on affected Whataya Want From Me, or becomes a desolate portrait on the eery Broken Open. He owns each note making it count, and if he doesn't seem quite emotionally invested enough, he has plenty of time for that in the years to come.  The album at its core is very much pop. The older crowd that may have liked him on American Idol won't find a lot to enjoy because of it, but it seems clear that this is the type of artist Adam wanted to become. The more rock-influenced songs, such as the aforementioned Music Again, the anthemic Sure Fire Winners, and the Linda Perry co-penned Pick U Up. It all adds to the final product, which is Adam as the glamorized pop rock god that he was always destined to be.  For Your Entertainment is a very strong record. A good six of seven singles could have been promoted from the project, and yet the general public was left with three, only one of which (the gorgeous Whataya Want From Me) painted the album favorably. It is quite the listening experience; no matter what genre Adam takes on, it all feels like he's bringing his best.

I was watching some late night rock n roll TV show, (It was either Don Kirshner's Rock Concert or The Midnight Special), and this band came on with an incredible lead singer and tight instrumental chops.  They caught my attention immediately and I had to explore more of their stuff.  I went out and bought their then current album, ""Infinity"" on the strength of those 10 minutes of exposure, and was hooked right away.  I had no clue that the band had already been around for half of a decade producing 3 albums of more progressive / fusion oriented music.  People who where already fans of the band recoiled in horror when vocalist Steve Perry joined the fold, but to my unexposed ears this was all new and fresh.  34 years later I still think this album holds up pretty well.  Several of the songs on this one have become bona fide classics  including ""Lights"", ""Feeling That Way"", ""Wheel In The Sky"" and the proggish ""Winds Of March"".  The use of occasional duel lead vocals between Perry and Rollie works great especially since they have such unique and different vocal styles.  The music on this one is much less progressive oriented than on the band's previous discs, but there are still some very nice guitar, keys, drums work here and there on the album.  I think Journey would go on to do better albums, but this one was a great launching pad for the band's next phase which would see them go from a club level act to arena superstars.",4,"10 9, 2012",Journey - Perry Joins Up,1349740800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},7.0,,feel drum nice away vocal much use rock midnight decade work way pad ear steve kirshner's come immediately vocals fusion level song half clue think night next join tight horror several perry journey chop superstars roll great already club act unique different later minute fan go good less music rollie one new right explore become first singer stuff arena light sky remember time infinity wind especially album bona disc would hook hold launch phase instrumental vocalist orient strength recoil still attention work see classic band lead tv year progressive guitar catch incredible fold occasional current buy fresh either keys watching album special around wheel since fide band's unexposed duel concert previous include people go well proggish show style late exposure march produce pretty

2010,265077,AT8TIN5JKHO2V,B0000032PS,Craig Fenton,False,"Amazon Reviews  As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.  Foghat's fifth release ""Fool For The City"" became the largest selling studio record and attracted many first timers for the ride.  The newer fans as expected gravitated immediately toward the two radio songs, the title cut and ""Slow Ride."" Those that had taken the slow ride with the band previously found equal pleasure throughout the album enjoying ""My Babe"" (The Righteous Brothers version is considered legendary) and ""Terraplane Blues"", to name only two.  Starting with the title track (Great choice for the opener), Foghat's sound is in your face. Their signature rock, blues, and boogie have our attention from the opening notes.  As ""My Babe"" plays you notice the funkier phrasing of the vocals. A terrific cover to an old classic.  ""Slow Ride"" has become a mainstay of Classic Rock Radio. Lonesome Dave and Rod's guitars are a blowtorch that can't be extinguished. Often overlooked and unfairly so is Nick's Jameson's bass that enhances the firepower. Jameson had a hand in the production and engineering and he picked his spots very well.  ""Terraplane Blues"" made sure to silence any question if Foghat would abandon the sound of the previous four records. As a master key, this would fit perfectly on any Foghat release.  ""Save You Loving (For Me)"" could be the most underrated track on the record. It has the mix of the typical strong Foghat song while fitting like a glove after ""Terraplane Blues.""  ""Drive Me Home"" has the band click on all cylinders. The vocals are well executed and the piano puts the right seasoning on the song.  ""Take It Or Leave It"" brings the festivities to an end. The slowest paced tune on the record shows even more of the groups diversity.  If you never experienced a studio Foghat album this is the perfect place to start. For those that have been with the ""Rock And Roll Outlaws"" doesn't your vinyl copy need replacing?

2015,184776,A26DPJ5DLJOT2O,B000002IWQ,R. Miller,True,"After spending the last several years laboring as a better-than-average -- and highly professional -- pop group, Rush returned to its hard-rock roots on COUNTERPARTS. Also, despite the presence of a couple of clunkers, they managed to come up with a fairly strong set of songs. The result was the band's best effort to date since GRACE UNDER PRESSURE.  The album opens with a really astounding 1-2-3 punch. On ""Animate"" the group manages to deconstruct a riff that sounds like it is straight off of a Pearl Jam record and to turn it into a bit of frothy hard prog-rock. ""Stick it Out"" is probably Rush's heartiest slab of metal since 2112 and is a heck of a lot of fun. ""Cut to the Chase"" is another strong up-tempo rocker which manages to sustain the momentum generated by the first two tracks.  After that, the record settles down a little. The best of the remaining tracks are ""Between Sun and Moon,"" ""Cold Fire,"" and ""Leave That Thing Alone."" ""Nobody's Hero,"" despite having one of the more ham-fisted verses ever written (the first), is still a good power ballad, complete with a fittingly over-the-top orchestration from Michael Kaman.  The only real dog here is ""The Speed of Love"" which should have been titled ""The Speed of a Slug."" ""Double Agent"" certainly has problems as well, but at least it has certain parts that I like a lot. I am torn over the spoken bits, because I love the guitar parts in those sections, but they still come across as a little dumb.

It's pretty refreshing, actually; I'm getting tired of groups who seem to never have some unifying sound behind them.  It seems even the great Radiohead aren't really ones for conssitency, as even on one album the styles vary wildly (Kid A, for example).  Here, Beth Gibbons and Co. have really etched out a style of their own, combining a '40's noir style with downtempo electronic beats, orchestration, and the occasional squalling guitar.  Unintentionally, I suspect, branded with the label ""trip-hop,"" this music still seems one of a kind no matter how you look at it. ""Mysterons,"" the kick-off for the album, is the best example of their mastery and technique.  With a sci-fi, quasi-wailing Ondes-Martenot from Star Trek line going through it, Gibbon's trembling, on-the-verge-of-breaking voice carries a plaintive melody that's hard to resist.  Same goes for their one hit, ""Sour Times,"" which with its spy-film soundtrack sensibilities and longing vocal still packs some strong emotional punch.  ""Strangers"" picks things up a bit, with a driving beat and synth tones giving Gibbon's impassioned vocals some oomph. Everything's a gem on here; even the tracks which seem most obviously filler benefit from their trappings and become just as catchy.  ""It Could Be Sweet,"" though overtly Sade-alike, has a delicate smoky atmosphere that's hundreds of times more subtle and adventurous than anything she's ever done.  ""Numb"" has an almost bratty vocal to it and a strangely Jamacian sound to its beat and tempo. The two classics on this record, though, ""Roads"" and ""Glory Box,"" are what launch this record to immortality.  ""Roads"" is probably the most emotionally simple and sincere song I've heard in a long time, with a muted beginning building up to a steady beat and lush orchestration, as Gibbons reflects on alienation, loss, and passion.  Towards the end as the song nears breaking emotionally, a gentle bassline brings everything back to earth.  Simply awesome.  ""Glory Box,"" on the other hand is more direct in its longings, as Gibbons pleas to ""give me a reason to be a woman,"" over a bluesy beat, strings, and bass, maybe suggesting to her nameless lover that this is something serious and not trite.  As the beat deconstructs the song, Gibbons wails ""This is the beginning of forever and ever,"" we can't do anything but take her, and her band, seriously, as one of the greatest collections of musicians of the 90's.",5,"03 25, 2003",Forging something incredible,1048550400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},2.0,,give on-the-verge-of-breaking launch hard go vocal stranger sensibility hand i've maybe star lush impassioned beth like drive emotionally steady suggest kid unintentionally ever kick-off vocal woman delicate trip-hop soundtrack earth resist could simply hear gibbon electronic actually sci-fi oomph think subtle one punch time lover can't orchestration passion towards brand gibbon's building seem take tired something great direct radiohead noir simple serious song plaintive downtempo bass obviously trek bratty long everything's refresh music longing line box gentle deconstruct great thing record really loss that's bring smoky one alienation break beat back atmosphere beats mysterons technique immortality trite pack bluesy vibe reason tremble sweet spy-film kind mastery go sade-alike forever seriously probably mute adventurous become bit reflect suspect almost time album wildly pick melody give etch tone glory road synth track nears everything nameless group squall still carry voice even hit matter classic sour filler plea band musician guitar co sound occasional longing vary ondes-martenot conssitency strangely never catchy begin i'm style combine tempo gem best two awesome sincere numb overtly look though emotional seem wail behind unifying end there's trapping jamacian quasi-wailing bassline get example do label strong style benefit hundred collection anything string pretty

2025,1154466,A2UXNWAZ9210SO,B000003CTI,Moldyoldie,True,"Charles Mackerras and the Prague Chamber Orchestra present exhilirating performances of these Mozart favorites with very fine recordings.  In reference to an earlier review, any so-called ""distance"" evaporates when you crank up the volume! Telarc offers up a comfortably moderate aural perspective with a wonderfully resonant bloom -- in my opinion, well-nigh perfect for a chamber-sized orchestra and for these works in particular. Discounting the opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik might be the most recognized piece of classical music in the entire repertoire, perhaps even the most popular.  As to the performances, all I can say is ""wunderbar!""

After all, there's more than one way to play this music.  However, despite his fine sense of musical architecture and orchestral balances, Bhm almost turns this light-hearted music into a sleeping pill substitute with his slow, measured tempos.  In contrast, Mackerras' tempos are lively, upbeat, and invigorating; the playing of the Prague Chamber Orchestra is magnificent!  After hearing Bhm's Posthorn Serenade, Mackerras' was like a refreshing splash in the pool, or maybe even a rousing slap in the face!

""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" is the studio version and not the better known version from ""Foghat Live.""  Everybody happy? Great. Now on to what really matters. Despite never getting the kind of praise that would have matched their peak popularity, Foghat were a people's rock band. Chances are pretty strong that, somewhere in America, a radio station is playing either ""Fool For The City"" or ""Slow Ride"" and someone is playing air boogie guitar nearby. During their glory run, from the albums ""Energized"" up to ""Stone Blue,"" Foghat saddled up Chuck Berry, Al Green and Buddy Holly next to solid originals like the masters that they were.  The format was simple. Take a basic riff, turn it up very loud and boogie like anytime was party time. And don't be afraid to indulge in some hard core blues rock like ""Take It or Leave It."" Add to the mix that Lonesome Dave Peverett's distinct vocals were a cut above most basic rock bands and you had the winning formula for seventies rock and roll. This was such great party rock that I and a group of fellow senior classmates went to see Foghat rock out Hersheypark Arena in 1978 just days before graduation. (With Sweet opening on their ""Love Is Like Oxygen"" tour, no less...sigh!) And you have to dig the way they made a Sun Records styled Christmas boogie out of ""All I Want For Christmas Is You.""  This two CD anthology is a much better buy than the ""Essentials"" dozen and the original Rhino Best of, and if you really want some great rock, you certainly won't be amiss if you purchase ""Fool For The City,"" ""Foghat Live"" or ""Night Shift."" But until someone decides that a Best Of Foghat CD should have the single edits replaced with their full length counterparts, this will suffice as a not quite five star collection.  This new set does have a pretty good set of fresh liner notes and decent mastering. (So how about the rest of the Foghat catalog, Rhino? ""Fool For The City"" and maybe a deluxe version of ""Foghat Live""?) The latter albums - basically everything post ""Stone Blue"" - get cherry-picked for the cooler cuts like ""Slipped Tripped and Fell In Love,"" ""Live Now Pay Later"" and ""Stranger in My Hometown.""

2035,1214222,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B000025XP1,Larry L. Looney,False,"Let me state from the beginning that anything you're fortunate to find by Anouar Brahem is going to be excellent.  This man is one of the most talented, consistently tasteful musicians around.  He is a multi-instrumentalist and composer, but his main instrument is the oud - the lute of the Arabic music world - and that's what he plays on this recording, accompanied simply and beautifully by Bechir Selmi on violin and Lassad Hosni on percussion.  All of the compositions here - based on traditional Arabic music forms - are by Brahem, except for `Barzakh' (composed by Brahem and Selmi);  and `Souga' and `Bou Naouara' (composed by Hosni). There are slow, moderate, and fast-paced pieces here - most are relatively short, with a couple of moderately long pieces and one lengthy one.  The musical ideas and themes are developed intelligently, with grace and incredible beauty - and none of the faster-paced passages give the feeling that the players are utilizing the tempo simply to impress the listener.  They allow the music to take them where it will, with no unnecessary side trips or embellishments - but even with the sparse instrumentation (or perhaps because of it), each piece is full and complete. ECM has a long-standing reputation for releasing music that refuses to be rammed into the corner of a single genre - BARZAKH is an outstanding example of that freedom of thought.  This is a recording that can be appreciated by almost anyone - fans of world/ethnic music (for obvious reasons); jazz (taqsim is the Arabic term for improvisation around an established theme, an important aspect of these pieces); and classical (for the Arabic classical elements in this music are strong).  The recording quality, as in every ECM release I've ever heard, is exceptional and `trick'-free, presenting the music to the listener with as few barriers as possible.

2036,608130,A1UMI7I5Q81G9R,B0009EOZYO,Ryan,True,"I have been a DT fan since I&W's hit the airwaves in 93.  Since then I have followed the band through every studio and live album release and I must confess that this latest effort is very disappointing to me as was ToT.  Before I go into detail I will sum my feelings up by saying that DT is regressing instead of progressing.  So why do I say that? Because veiled behind the amazing technical ability of the band members is the same recycled guitar riffs, instrumental passages, drum beats, and operatic vocals since SFAM.  Does anyone else notice that since Rudess joined the band their style has remained consistant and might I say quite boring?  It seems obvious that song structure is no longer a concern to DT and they feel quite content jamming to tape in the studio and then laying down uninspiring vocals over the music.  I am not sure why DT also feels the need to become so introspective and dark with their lyrics.  The mood of their lyrics seem so heavy but fail to be captavating at all.  As you might tell I am a long time fan who is coming to the realization that the band I onced loved and respected is now losing my attention.  I know there are a lot of new fans who love DT's current music but for me songs such as ""Caught in a Web"" ""Voices"" ""ACOS"" ""Lines in the Sand"" and ""Pull me Under"" and even a few off SFAM and 6DOIT represent what I liked best about DT.  Songs that were accessible while maintaining a heavy, technical, and progressive element.  My suggestion to DT...lose Rudess and stop rehashing the same idea and get back to writing songs with some vibe and interest rather than instrumentals with vocals.

2042,179052,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000002J2F,mwreview,False,"Duke is the best Genesis album of the Phil Collins era. A little above Trick of the Tail, further ahead of Abacab and miles away from most of the second side of their self titled album, Invisible Touch, and We Can't Dance. It is one of those albums I love to listen to straight through. It is wonderful and, on a personal level, helped me get through a rough time. I was working at a job I hated 60 miles from home and the one thing that kept my spirits up was knowing I would be listening to this cassette during the commute to and fro. Even though, lyrically, the songs on Duke are about loss, I feel good listening to it. Musically, it is uplifting. It starts with the powerful ""Behind the Lines"" (a much better version then the one found on Phil Collins' solo album). ""Duchess"" is my favorite. It is about the rise and fall of a singer who was, at first, very committed to her art (""But she really cared about her music, it all seemed so important then"") but then became wrapped up in trying to keep her newly earned fame (""Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want""). On VH1's Behind the Music, Tony Banks referred to this track when describing his band's current state. ""Guide Vocal"" is tied to ""Duchess"" and is a short, beautiful ballad with simple piano. ""Man of Our Times"" is the most experimental of the tracks. The aggressive keyboards almost dominate the vocals. It is a little long and repetitive, but very unique nonetheless. ""Misunderstanding"" was the single and quite a good one. You can't help but sing along to it, it is very addictive. On the second side ""Turn It On Again"" is another fan favorite. It is an aggressive rocker perfect for the live shows. It sounds even better on Three Sides Live. ""Alone Again"" and ""Please Don't Ask"" are two pleasing songs about lost love. The latter is a very personal song about Collins' divorce that is, lyrically, even more revealing than the songs on his solo album Face Value (""I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world but I miss my boy""). The last tracks are powerful instrumentals (limited vocals on one) that are definitely not fillers. Fans of Genesis' later material who do not have Duke are missing out on something very special.

2045,444112,AAZ7KZVDJOZP5,B00005BJMW,Nicholas Denoia,False,"I never gave this band any thought until I saw them cover Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" for 2003's MTV Icon. And though they didn't play the whole song, they did play the solo and the fact that they were able to pull that off got the attention of me.  When some kid I knew was giving away CD's he didn't listen to anymore, along with two other CD's, I picked this one just to see what the boys were made of. Well, I was a bit disappointed.  It seems that though these guys grew up listening to bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden (as mentioned in the song ""Fat Lip"") and seem to be decently talented players, they are either only capable of writing pop-punk music or they were just focusing on what pleases the masses when making this record.

2055,203977,A3S175V6UMWDSU,B000002KEN,Robert,False,"""BILLION DOLLAR BABIES""  REVIEW:  This is the peak of the success of the Alice Cooper group. ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" which was produced once again by the great Bob Ezrin, is the group at its most theatrical. Top notch production values highlights this album that would eventually include such concert staples like ""Hello Hooray,"" ""Elected,"" ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" ""No More Mr. Nice Guy,"" ""Sick Things,"" and ""I Love the Dead"". However, both ""Unfinished Sweet"" and ""Generation Landslide"" are some of the best tracks on the album!!  In 2001, . Warner Bros./Rhino re-issued the ""Billion Dollar Babies"" album with excellent bonus/live tracks that included: ""Hello Hooray"" (live '73), ""Billion Dollar Babies"" (live '73), ""Elected"" (live '73), ""I`m Eighteen"" (live '73), ""Raped and Freezin'"" (live '73), ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" (live '73),  ""My Stars"" (live '73), ""Unfinished Sweet"" (live '73), ""Sick Things"" (live '73), ""Dead Babies"" (live '73), ""I Love The Dead"" (live '73), ""Coal Black Model T"" (a early version of 'Slick Black Limousine'), ""Son Of Billion Dollar Babies"" ('Generation Landslide' Outtake), ""Slick Black Limousine"" . The collection of live tracks on the digipack re-release of ""Billion Dollar Babies"" is the best live recordings (on CD) to be found of Alice Cooper.  MUSICIANS:  Alice Cooper - Vocals and Harmonica  Neal Smith - Drums and Vocals  Dennis Dunaway - Bass and Vocals  Glen Buxton - Lead Guitar  Michael Bruce - Rhythm Guitar, Vocals, Piano and Organ  Bob Ezrin - Keyboards  Mick Mashbir - Guitar  Dick Wagner - Guitar on ""I Love The Dead""  Steve Hunter - Guitar work on ""I Love The Dead,"" ""Generation Landslide,"" and ""Sick Things"".  Donovan Leitch - Vocals on ""Billion Dollar Babies""  Reggie Vincent - Percussion on ""Elected,"" Guitar on ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" ""Elected,""  ""Raped And Freezin'"" and ""No More Mr Nice Guy.""  INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released in January of 1973, ""Billion Dollar Babies"" peaked at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 and would quickly become another Platinum selling album for the group. Meanwhile the album spawned three Top 40 hit singles. ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" at #25, ""Elected"" at #26 and ""Hello Hooray"" at #35. The single ""Billion Dollar Babies"" would only peak at #57.  2. ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" was actually written around the time of the group's 1971 album ""Killer"" but it didn't fit the theme of the album. It was then re-submitted for ""School's Out"" but was again rejected.  3. The song ""Elected"" was a ""re-imagining"" of the band's 1969 song ""Reflected"".  4. The song ""Hello Hooray"" was written by Canadian songwriter Rolf Kempf, and was originally performed by Judy Collins.  PACKAGING:  Excellent album cover. The CD booklet features pictures of the Alice Cooper Group, as well as a clever drawing of a ""One Billion"" Dollar bill. It also features the album's lyrics, as well the typical Warner Bros.

(I know they did some Glam/heavy metalish stuff in their early years but that isn't really my thing) But Cowboys From Hell is Pantera's shinning moment, more so than any of their other albums. This album puts together some of the best qualities of music. Great melody, and strength with the brutality Phil Anselmo has in his voice and Darrel Roberts has on the guitar. Vinny Paul, isn't the best drummer but he is the best drummer for Pantera? (Catch what I'm saying?) The title track is killer and its one of their bests. ""Primal Concrete Sledge"" has a crunchy guitar riff and a powerful chorus. Another highlight of this album is ""Domination"" It is powerful, rebellious, and catchy.

I got turned onto Nightwish by accidentally stumbling on their live performance from Wacken, Germany, just three days ago. It took me all of about three minutes to realize that this is a band to be reckoned with, they are anything BUT subtle! I immediately went out and started to purchase their catalog with this being the first. I wanted a recording with Floor as the vocalist, being familiar with her work from other endeavors, most notably for me Areyon and Star One. While opinions always vary, I personally think she is one of the strongest female vocalists in the genre and her stage presence is without compare in almost any genre. I can add nothing to the other reviews except to agree with all the 4 and 5 stars and that you simply must listen to this LOUD on the biggest sound system you can find.

2060,14529,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000000IUC,Bryan,False,"Unfortunately, I can't quite give in to majority opinion and declare Murmur to be one of REM's greatest, most underrated efforts.  I say ""underrated"" because you never actually hear any of these songs on radio stations, which is definitely not the same story when it concerns OTHER REM albums (such as every album they created from the late 80's to the early to mid 90's).  However on the internet, Murmur is certainly a popular album and many consider it one of REM's best.  Murmur honestly feels like yet another beginning effort by an aspiring rock band before eventually moving on to bigger and better things.  In other words, while the songwriting on here is memorable enough to get the job done (and on some occasions -such as the first four tracks- REALLY terrific) the album as a whole doesn't actually scream of greatness like, for example, Automatic for the People does.  Another complaint is that some of these songs are predictably written and that doesn't help matters either.  Of course it's possible this is just an example of me being really familiar with their later albums to the point I have a really good idea what the bands style is like by now.  ""Radio Free Europe"" reminds me of Tom Petty quite a bit, though to the bands credit, 9 out of 10 times Petty would *never* make something this melodic.  Other moments like on ""Pilgrimage"" the chorus isn't quite as strong as many people would have you believe.  It's a good effort obviously, and it grows on you with repeated listens.  Another problem is that many of these songs blend together.  I must have heard this album at least 10 times by now and I *still* can't remember how any of it goes when it's finally over.  Some of the tracks like ""Laughing"" and ""Shaking Through"" really blend together which therefore means I have trouble separating them in my mind.  Of course while they're playing I LOVE them.  ""We Walk"" has an AWESOME vocal melody though, and ""West of the Fields"" ends the album on a really good energetic note.  Murmur has one more flaw, though not necessarily a major one- I don't quite understand how this album is supposed to sound way ahead of its time.  Sure, the production is good, but then again, early U2 albums sound excellent as well and yet THOSE albums never get the same amount of credit or recognition that Murmur does.  To sum up the experience- the songwriting is good half of the time, great during the other half (hence the 5 star rating).  Murmur doesn't sound drastically ahead of its time like many people believe.  I realize REM is considered one of the founders of the alternative rock movement, but this album doesn't really reveal any alternative rock tendencies (and if it does, I can't hear them).  Many of the songs blend together because the band hasn't yet developed an ability to thrown down a creative set of songs (something they'd improve upon in the future).  As a result of all these flaws, I can't help but think Murmur is somewhat overrated.  Just a tad.

Everything from the album artwork, the inner sleeve that came with the vinyl that admonishes the listener to play the record loud, to the opening track, which in my opinion is not only the best Rolling Stones song, period, but the best representation of what a rock song should be in general - the incomparable ""Gimme Shelter"". If you could only pick one song as the best in the genre then in my mind ""Gimme Shelter"" is it. Again, there are others who make the case for the album and the individual tracks - and they do a fine job. So I have nothing to add - be sure to read their reviews for the history and critiques, as most of them are quite good and insightful.  And I will not debate which is the better album, Sticky Fingers or Let It Bleed - I will leave that debate to others. My position is stated above. It is subjective. The two albums are very different from one another, but there is little doubt that these are the two best Stones albums. People can have their personal favorites, but no serious fan or critic of the Stones can be taken seriously if the say that the best Stones album is not one of these two albums. Period.  However, what I must address here, as I did with my review of Sticky Fingers, is what kind of rope are the 13 reviewers who rated this album as 1 Star smoking? What sort of scarey and abysmal music collection adorns their rooms and iPods?  What, pray tell, rates a 5 Star album in their world?

There's even one track for the potheads (#9 ""Mary Jane"").

Houlihan,False,"(continued from above)...the power,majesty,and glory we Yesfans had all suspected was present in the recording,but not quite heard since this controversial album's release,nearly 31 years ago now. Since I acquired this item solely for the possibility that something like this had happened,that someone had finally gotten it right,I cannot tell you quite how happy I am with this reissue,for mere words cannot convey. I have shared my Yes enthusiasm with members of my family and friends(some have called 'shared'-'infected'!!!)since way back when,and for us,as I see has been true for many of you,this 'album'(my archaic terminology itself gives my own personal antiquity away...)has been a source of much consternation and ambivalence. Until now.  Having seen this band live 6 times over the last 4 & 1/2 years,during an improbable resurgence(somehow it has become,at long last,almost hip again to love them...personally,I kind of miss the days when they were nearly universally despised by the rock [un]""intelligentsia"",and they were,kind of...'our little secret'...but few bands have worked harder on the road in the last decade,if any,and at last they may have reaped some small reward for this labor),& having been a rabid fan since 1973(only semi-rabid from '71 to '73!!),the year this item was released,I feel at least somewhat qualified to remark upon their,and it's sound.  One thing I have noticed,first of all,is that whenever this band decides to play from this album,in performance-magic ensues. They're so wonderful live anyway,it's particularly special when there's Topographic to be played! I've seen it. I've heard it. You Yesfans know it's true!  So what does that have to do with this product review?Ah-ha!....I've been waiting for this question!-  Try listening to this remaster as though Yes were performing it right in front of your face. I can see them playing it,whenever I listen. That is the highest compliment that I think can be paid to an endeavour such as this. Every vocal track,every instrumental line, can now be heard clearly. And clearly,the band composed this album with the intent of playing these monumental compositions for a live audience. However,not until now has the full impact of this material been available to the listener,unless the band itself is playing it.  So,I've often found myself wondering about this,the most universally loathed of all Yes' main sequence classic 70's releases. Until I saw them play again from it live(I DID see them play the entire album in what has now become a legendary Madison Square Garden show in 1974,but it was so long ago,I barely knew what I was looking at,or hearing,and barely remember it!),at which time it almost seemed as if they too,were rediscovering the material.

Great songs, great production (by Lloyd Maines, no less), excellent musicians and a nice voice. But what is this about so-called Red Dirt music. Forgive me, this album sounds very country and not at all dissimilar to the stuff that Garth Brooks was releasing in the early '90s. Some of the songs are similar in style to those that Garth released (Wolves, The Thunder Rolls, Belleau Wood, The Cowboy Song and so on), the arrangements are very similar and Jason Boland's voice even sounds like Garth in inflection and tone in places.  It is obviously not fashionable to admit to liking Garth Brooks, but I do (especially his early stuff) but I would say that Jason Boland has been listening to it and has produced an album that matches up very favorably.

2079,1259641,A3KV8E79WT10ZI,B00006IJ4A,Matt Stoessel,True,"First of all, I should congratulate you for finding such a rare jewel.  Few bands can do what ...And Oceans does, Samael being the only other I know of.  Cradle of Filth has a song as the last track on the bonus disc on Cruelty and the Beast but it is far from the same.  It is really a full techno song with black vocals and lyrics.  Also, Dismal Euphony's closing track on Autumn Leaves has a techno edge to it, but it's even worse.  Tristania's World of Glass album has a song that tries to mix techno, but it is awful.  These bands should stick with what they do best. So how does ...And Oceans do it?  Well, I can't figure it out either!  We metal fans should just take them for granted.  Some fans of traditional black and death metal won't be disappointed with this sound.  Every song is pure death metal (yeah, this album isn't as much black metal as other releases - there are only 2 short blast beats) with OCCASIONAL techno beats.  Most of where the techno comes into play is in what would be the ""by hand"" equivalent of a bass and keyboards.  If you want a pure techno song with black vocals, Cradle of Filth's song does the job and the last song on this band's previous release does the job beautifully.  Also, what I miss the most on this album are parts like the beginning of ""Tears Have No Name"" on the previous release.  Also, the CD is heavy enough to contain blast beats and sound good, so where did they all go? So overall, I'm not saying this is a bad release.  It is just not atmospheric, making it not quite my cup of tea.  I prefer albums ""Allotropic Metamorphic Genesis of Dimorphisism"" and ""Eternal"" more than this. Alright, let's talk about my title.

How could I even come close to the quality of the thoughtful reviews that have preceded mine?  Well, I can't. All I can say is that this album, for me, changed everything. I had no idea that music could be so touching, so intimate, and at the same time so raw. When I first heard it, I was in the throws of electronica obsession - and to a certain extent, I still am. But after the first spin of this album, I was even more obsessed with electronica. Funny, huh? Perhaps you were expecting me to say something like, 'After I heard this album, I was completely head-over-heals obsessed with it and never thought twice about throwing in a Chemical Brothers album.' Nope. That's not it at all.  This album took a long time to grow on me. Like 3 years. And I'm so happy I didn't loose my patience. I read somewhere that it's the albums that you initially find the most difficult that are the ones you love forever. I think that's a perfect way to state how I feel about ""Loveless"".  I've tried long and hard to find an album that compares not only in quality, but one that gives me the same feeling as when I first really appreciated ""Loveless"". So far I've come close with Ride's ""Nowehere"", Catherine Wheel's ""Ferment"" and Slowdive's ""Slouvlaki"" -- but even those amazing records don't come close.  Instead of going into a song-by-song analysis, which 33 1/3 has already admirably done, all I'm going to say is that if you want music which is truly transportive (I may have made that word up), check out ""Loveless"".

2086,782981,A3TSB3MKTNS4B2,B001CISHU4,Kendra Smith,False,"I love Amon Amarth. With Oden On Our Side is my favorite death metal album ever, and the rest of their back catalog is either pretty good or incredible.  For me, though, Twilight just wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be, and boy did I hope. I really, REALLY wanted to say this is a good album, but it just did not capture the same feel and intensity that the rest of the band's work did.  The album starts off great. The title track is easily on par with, if not better than, the best of the band's music. It's in your face, loud, and just works, telling the tale of Thor's final battle during Ragnarok. Then of course there's Roope's solo. I only don't like its inclusion because it causes the sound to change when they play it live, but that's a small thing that can be overlooked, and it's also not to say it's a great solo, because it is. I saw them play it, and it was still a great set opener.  But then comes ""Free Will Sacrifice"" and already the album's power, quality, greatness, etc. begin to diminish. Compared to the song that came before it, ""Free Will"" sounds remarkably weak. It reminds me of how ""Where Death Seems To Dwell"" seemed a rather weak second track on Fate of Norns, especially coming right after the brilliant song that is ""An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm.""  ""Guardians of Asgaard"" has become quite the fan favorite these days. I feel that this song is also weak as a whole, but it has an excellent chorus and solo (nice, soft, and slow, but it works).  The chorus is probably one of their best but the rest of the song feels too slow and generic. I really, REALLY wish that they could've done the rest of it so much better than it actually is.  ""Where Is Your God?"" is one of my favorites on the album. The gallop beat is awesome and reminds me of an army of vikings on horseback in battle against their enemies. It's not another ""Death in Fire"" or ""Pursuit of Vikings,"" but for what it's worth it's a really good song.  About the only other songs I really enjoyed were ""The Hero"" and ""Embrace Of The Endless Ocean."" The latter feels like an appropriate closer. It really reminds me of the closer on their last album, ""Prediction of Warfare,"" and also ""Fate of Norns.""  ""The Hero"" sounds almost ballad-like and rather soft for the Norsemen, but it truly captures the feeling of what a warrior/soldier/etc. feels and endures during their lives. How can one truly believe these people never feel a sort of pain or guilt for people they kill in war? This song is about one such man, who calls himself ""an evil man"" for killing as he did, yet the title implies everyone else thinks he is a hero and he is about to lose their lives for their well being.  All the other songs, though, feel like a mess, especially compared to their other albums. Many others will enjoy it (it's obvious this point has already been proven judging by both the star rating this album currently holds and that a user poll on AOL Radio listed this album as one of the top 10 death metal albums of all time) and if you like Amon Amarth's other stuff or just like death metal as a whole, give the album a try.  There's enough here to satisfy new fans to get them ready for the band's earlier material, so it's also a great place for listeners to start. If you like this one, try one of the three albums that came before this one, With Oden On Our Side, Fate Of Norns, or Versus The World, then continue backwards from there. If you like the brutal viking metal end of this, I also recommend Borknagar, Enslaved, Immortal, early Satyricon, and Bathory (Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart, Blood On Ice, and their two Nordland albums). For simply the pagan viking genre overall, try Falkenbach (about half of their songs also fit the brutal category above), Tyr, Ensiferum, Leaves' Eyes, 3 Inches of Blood, and Therion (particularly their Secret of the Runes and Gothic Kabbalah albums).",3,"08 2, 2009","For Me, The Album Stumbles",1249171200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,asgaard power star gallop come ever diminish start slow inch actually try remarkably last get favorite category many thing song pursuit seem really beat right point believe amarth's thor's album's kill ready falkenbach stuff almost remind aol cause would metal particularly ragnarok viking work tyr easily sound either live enjoy saw endure overall set two endless opener boy do backwards lose small wish feeling give oden kabbalah much radio enjoy like mess evil title everyone brutal blood well storm amarth hope obvious one prediction death love new guardian whole generic leave material ancient worth day become time twilight call top immortal etc also still weak brilliant user solo ice incredible side album amon gothic intensity yet though there's guilt three dwell could've roope's rather hammerheart second latter nice listener work genre fire recommend song simply half hero others viking war enough secret norn seem change greatness catalog want fan fate music embrace god poll course face back quality place par enemy favorites free sign good satisfy fit rune come list early sacrifice start man versus ballad-like overlooked rating hop capture continue best awesome come warfare horseback well say another final killing therion implies track enslave quite world nordland soft great feel already eye borknagar feel begin pain pagan early bathory judging that's play ensiferum appropriate army currently compare live loud sound probably tell truly inclusion norseman sort especially album hold fan proven satyricon closer battle think rest else never capture tale ocean chorus band's warrior/soldier/etc excellent end people pretty

However, this is nearly all music. I must say that in addition to Wynton's virtuoso trumpet playing, the band playing with him on ""He And She"" is STELLAR!! Walter Blanding on saxophone plays in outstanding fashion, sometimes cool and other times blisteringly hot(with Wynton matching him at every turn). Plus, this rhythm section is truly outstanding: Drummer Ali Jackson & bassist Carlos Henriquez at times steal the whole show, and pianist Dan Nimmer does a great job throughout.

2101,729387,A18IZ5QX2PRB3C,B0012IXBPA,Michael Stack,False,"It's been 25 years since Bauhaus released a studio record (1983's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burning-from-the-Inside/dp/B000002GDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burning from the Inside</a>).  In the intervening time, the band has been busy with vocalist Peter Murphy pursuing a solo career and the rest of the band-- guitarist Daniel Ash, bassist David J and drummer Kevin Haskins finding fame as Love & Rockets.  After a handful of reunion tours (the first of which documented on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gotham/dp/B000031KB7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gotham</a>) and persistent rumors of an album, ""Go Away White"" has finally arrived, the band's ""farewell"" record (yeah, we've heard that before).  But like I said, it's been 25 years since these guys have gone in the studio to record new material-- goth and new wave (and contrary to popular assessment, Bauhaus straddled both camps) have run their course and spawned their children in the various alternative movements of the past 20 years and glam music had been reduced to a bunch of guys with eye liner and trashy metal riffs before collapsing.  So it's into this that Bauhaus' new album arrives, and one thing I can say-- you can't go home again.  The music of Bauhaus in the late '70s and early '80s was unique, powerful and of its time.  It stands on its own but one fears any effort to recapture that glory would fall flat-- mind you, it'd draw its armies of praise from the retro crowd, but in five years, it'd be a record collecting dust like other similar projects.  Happily, Bauhaus did not pursue this route, instead turning out something entirely new.  This comes clear pretty much right from the start-- ""Two Much 21st Century"" kicks in with a modern production vibe-- bright guitars and a crisp, ringing bass sit in between a great rolling backbeat and Murphy's explosive vocal.  It's a statement-- this isn't your dad's Bauhaus, if anything, it sounds like what Murphy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unshattered/dp/B00063MCB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unshattered</a>&nbsp;should have been (I just couldn't get into that record).  As the record moves on, it sounds essentially like a modern band that's really influenced by Bauhaus, admittedly sometimes this is more overt (loping goth piece ""Mirror Remains"") and sometimes less so (""Undone"", a rambling alt-rock slice that could have come off a Jane's Addiction album but for the vocal).  The album does consistently hold interest, and while it does have an occasional foray into goofy glam (""International Bulletproof Talent""), the balance of great songs such as screechy guitar driven funk rocker ""Adrenalin"", droning goth redux ""Dog's a Vapour"" (full of harmony laden vocals and a doom-driven musical cut) and post punk rocker ""Black Stone Heart"" (really quite the standout) carry the record straight through to the closing ambient cut ""Zikir"", recalling the best work in this form of the side careers of the band.  The only downside is that apparently the sessions yielded some sort of division in the band and this is being described as the band's farewell.  The material sounds like it'd come alive in concert and it's a shame to hear.  Nonetheless, it's great to see a Bauhaus record that has something to say.",4,"03 5, 2008","Proof you can't go home again, but then... why would you want to?",1204675200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},28.0,,"fall fame collapse funk division fear explosive dust slice away glam doom-driven ringing crowd black vocal vapour redux much close apparently effort yeah bright quite recall goofy work remain career riff like career stand influence say vocal admittedly driven arrives bauhaus powerful straight could songs interest come heard drone liner guy handful loping tour screechy harmony hold rocker lade can't child get zikir mirror we've modern statement shame thing goth on&nbsp;<a something great happily ramble unique musical century project downside bass undone yield rumor dad's less music document international form rocket record really draw that's course one jane's entirely love balance crisp new go foray haskins adrenalin murphy's&nbsp;<a right guitarist kick reduce popular assessment cut similar farewell vibe material drummer sound home daniel session roll consistently straddle pursue first david come post contrary turning studio route full early backbeat time find sort mind album would heart various metal collect describe white sometimes glory wave standout alive hear movement vocalist guitar production reunion finally see start data-hook=""product-link-linked murphy band solo rest recapture five class=""a-link-normal arrived year stone alt-rock talent ash murphy's guitar sit overt occasional addiction kevin release move side retro dog's intervene pursue piece bulletproof since best band's two concert inside</a persistent instead peter run punk bassist bunch eye trashy army flat camp nonetheless spawn go alternative it'd essentially past say busy ambient late carry anything clear praise pretty"

This album seems to feel like a fly on my wall that just won't go away. The first single off this album was ""Swallowed"" which to me features one of the worst videos of all time where it seems like everyone was at an acid party, and everybody after a great big dinner started dancing up and down up and down let's hope they didn't get sick. The song in some ways was one of the angriest songs of the 90's, but to me it seemed as though it reminded me of the Tomy pocket game called ""The Kissing Game"". You know where you pull back on a lever, and you'd see what kind of faces the boy and girl would make, and it just seemed to remind me of the girl making a smiling face while the boy was all angry. I had feelings for a woman at that time, but was afraid to get hurt, so I put on a angry face to keep me safe. Then the other single was ""Greedy Fly"". I finally found this song as it was a thorn in my flesh. I remember March 24th, 1997 this was the day my parents were over, and my mom gave me this card to give to my grandmother to sign. You see my grandmother at this time was dying of Pancreatic Cancer, and she had moved back to Pennsylvainia. She had no clue, or so I think at this time that my brother and I were hiding a secret from her. At the suggestion of my parents we didn't tell her about the fact we had bought a house because we were in debt to her for when we moved down here to Florida. After she died I felt so terrible and full of regret I did the only thing I knew how to do, and that was run away. I ran away spiritually, mentally, and emotionally. I remember signing the card during the playing of this song especially with the guitar solo after the second verse. It was like being told to sit at the table till my green vegetables were done. I feel as though my grandmother died without hearing about Jesus, and I can't deal with that, and my parents were like the money I owed her was a gift, and I'm still coming to terms with this.  I regret this so very much as my grandmother and I didn't have a close relationship at all, and now she's been dead. I know after she died I went on a self-destructive binge of spending money on myself, and causing myself to go into debt because I didn't care anymore. I regret having hidden this secret from her because I know after her death there was her blood on my hands, and I couldn't get them clean, so I ran to hide, and I would through having sex outside of marriage, spending money like crazy, and through church activities. Talk about a greedy fly; I lived it all my life. This song had such a depressing hold on me, and I release it now to free my life to fill with things that are good and Godly.

2121,675587,A1M1PPER44S9AI,B000J4OSRI,gnagfloW,False,"For those thinking this is the definite Oasis singles collection, take a look at the songs NOT included (highest U.K. chart position):  Shakermaker #11 Whatever #3 Roll With It #2 D'You Know What I Mean #1 Stand By Me #2 All Around The World #1 Who Feels Love? #4 Sunday Morning Call #4 The Hindu Times #1 Stop Crying Your Heart Out #2 Little By Little #2 She Is Love #2 Let There Be Love #2  Their web site states: ""The tracks as chosen by the band themselves - the songs they believe encapsulate their remarkable career to date."" For many though, omitting all these tracks (no less than 3 number one hits) is rather excessive. Actually, this track list would make most bands proud of their achievement. Usually when tracks are omitted on such greatest hits compilations, those are one or two songs the band just simply hate (case in point is the recent R.E.M. In Time compilation which skips Shiny Happy People) or more often minor hits or known album tracks.  Not one track from Be Here Now is included but over half of the tracks here are from their first two releases, incidentally the albums most people already own.  This edition includes a bonus DVD.  Given the type of this compilation, it should be no surprise that it consists mainly of a few performances and interviews.  Alas, this is not the place to find Oasis videos in one place.  This is not to say that the songs on this compilation are not superb, they are.  On that strength I give this set 4 stars (I am probably generous).  There should, however, be a warning sticker on this release stating that this is merely a compilation, nothing more.  An alarming case in point is the track Whatever, which has only been available as a single. This begs the question, why is there not a double CD version of this release?

2134,189500,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B000002JSZ,Missing Person,True,"Originally released in August of 1983, ""Flick of the Switch"" is a damn fine AC/DC record, and if you love the band, I really can't understand not digging it.  In the liner notes for the 2003 remastered version of ""Flick..."", Malcolm Young explains that the band wanted to get back-to-basics with this record, which they produced themselves, and you can see what he means--the album has a real live-in-the-studio sound to it, with guitars exploding out of the speakers, plus all but two of the tracks are under 4 minutes, and they've completely ditched the special effects a la the bell tolls on ""Hells Bells"" or the cannons on ""For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)"".  Also, Brian Johnson's vocals are at their gloriously piercing best throughout.  The liner notes in the 2003 reissue also state that the album is ""remarkably varied"". Is this a joke or what? One thing that there sure as hell isn't a lot of on this album is variety. The boys do a nice job of mixing up the tempos--you have your slower paced tunes (""Rising Power"", ""Nervous Shakedown"", ""Deep In The Hole""), medium-fast tunes (title track, ""Guns For Hire"", ""Bedlam In Belgium""), and fast tunes (""Landslide"", ""Brain Shake"")--but that hardly makes for a ""remarkably varied"" batch of songs. One thing I won't argue about though is that the album is indeed very consistent.  The album starts off with ""Rising Power"" which is one of those great AC/DC stompers, with a brilliant sequence of kickass riffs.  Likewise, ""Nervous Shakedown"" has another great sequence of riffs and builds spellbinding tension before breaking into the call-and-response chorus. The title track, with its sly guitar licks, is a ton of fun. The boogying ""Landslide"" is one of the most wildly exciting rock songs ever--it's a furious, fast-paced thrill ride with an ultra-catchy rapid-fire vocal hook leading into the chorus, and blistering guitar soloing from Angus; if this song doesn't get your heart racing, I don't know what the hell will. Also irresistible are ""Deep In The Hole"", with its cry-of-desperation chorus; and ""Bedlam In Belgium"", with its clever almost-but-not-quite-synchronized rhythm guitar parts and its spiritedly malevolent chorus.  As solid as the album is, it's not a bonafide classic. ""This House Is On Fire"" is a middling rewrite of ""Hells Bells"". ""Guns For Hire"" sounds a bit rushed-through and underwritten, although there's no denying that it's got a hell of a main riff. The bluesy ""Badlands"" lazily recycles the ""Bad Boy Boogie"" riff, although there is an ear-catching bit in the riff just before the guitar solo. The album closing ""Brain Shake"" is a really cool tune that seems to borrow some of its riffery straight from the Beatles ""Helter Skelter"", but the repetitive ""joy to ride"" 'hook' gets to be a little annoying, as does the heavy repetition of the title.  You've got to be nuts to think that this album marks the beginning of a major artistic decline for AC/DC.  If you actually enjoy the watered-down, Foreigner-style arena-rock of songs like ""Touch Too Much"" and ""You Shook Me All Night Long"", then it makes sense that you'd find this album disappointing.  But the true AC/DC aren't about lame cockrock; they're about ass-kicking hard rock, and ""Flick of the Switch"" does a very fine job of capturing the true essence of the band--this album is a must for any true AC/DC fan.",4,"09 12, 2005","really solid--doesn't reach classic status, but comes pretty close",1126483200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},10.0,,"blister know track nice call-and-response tune house power cannon hard flick rapid-fire shake"")--but vocal joy get close much build hell find rock middle helter they've belgium enjoy lame repetitive speaker riff fire like capture understand hell vocal stomper furious true start straight song deny clever liner underwritten fine actually completely medium-fast think ride lead malevolent young band--this beatles ac/dc salute remarkably job pace title riffery night can't toll consistent tempos--you get irresistible brian means--the ton thing seem effect sure great solid minute note want real state song must mix deep artistic although long thrill bedlam cockrock decline fun little record really tunes repetition bell watered-down one rewrite ditch break joke hook love touch lot johnson's explain annoy august brain ultra-catchy lazily borrow hire argue arena-rock bonafide bluesy sense badlands boogying nut back-to-basics sound hole slow rushed-through likewise boys live-in-the-studio varied gun skelter spiritedly hardly bit major variety cool sly dig version shakedown switch produce gloriously album la excite wildly sequence heart angus rhythm lick mark part fast-paced landslide track bad batch also fan nervous guitar indeed see cry-of-desperation brilliant explode essence boogie band fast kickass race ear-catching solo shook guitar sound release main ever--it's plus almost-but-not-quite-synchronized special shake begin foreigner-style disappointing ass-kicking riff best reissue chorus two classic tension though throughout boy make there's bell pierce originally rise heavy soloing recycles malcolm damn another get they're remastered spellbinding"

2137,663536,A1E08DHJFORY6U,B000GY729M,Kid A,False,"The Killers' debut was easy to like.  It was straight-up '80s-influenced rock.  Nothing complicated.  It also would have been easy to release a follow up that attempted to continue to milk the success of their previous release.  First off, I am glad The Killers decided not to rehash their first album.  The question, though, is whether or not what they've done with Sam's Town is worth the effort.  The first track, Sam's Town, sets the groundwork for the rest of the album.  Although there is still some of that trademark synthesizer sound, it is relegated to the background as a heavier guitar sound takes over.  After a short detour with ""enterlude"", the current radio-play song, When You Were Young brings back the synthesizer a bit.  Perhaps this song is the closest thing to the sound everybody broke their teeth on so many months ago.  Admittedly, I am not overly fond of it.  It sounds too much like an attempt to throw a hasty coat of paint on an old theme.  Although I've seen several people mention ""Bling"" as a standout on this album, it's somewhat of a pass for me.  I prefer For Reasons Unknown, the following song.  It sports the high-tempo vocals that make The Killers what they are without sounding much like the material from their debut.  Read My Mind and Uncle Jonny continue to help define The Killers new sound.  Neither is a ""killer"" (pun intended), but they manage to hold their own.  The following track, though, ""Bones"" is a standout.  This song manages to extend what's at the heart of what makes The Killers who they are; the melodic rollercoaster ride with Brandon's voice getting a nice workout along the way.  The next few songs, while not necessarily notable, certainly aren't bad.  On a side note, the last song, ""exitlude"" reminds me a bit of Modest Mouse.  It is an interesting change of pace to end the album and closes down the theme set up by ""enterlude"".  All in all, Sam's Town doesn't quite live up to the standard set by the debut.  However, it is still a good listen.  It is obvious The Killers are trying to move in a different direction without completely abondoning what got them to where they are.  Change is good, and there is a lot of room for these guys to evolve.

It was a great record in 1991 and it was still exceptional in 2002 when I first reviewed it.  The only complaint I have about the original piece is something is lost in the production.  I could never put my finger on why I would still listen to the songs from the record, but only when they were played live in the many ""official bootlegs"" released by the band.  I then read a review that said something along the line of ""studio effects that were applied to give a stadium feel were more 80's than 90's"" and it hit me as finally someone had put to words my only problem with this piece of rock history.  The new versions, re-arranged and produced by long-time Pearl Jam producer Brendan O'Brian are cleaner and sharper than the originals.  You can make out more of what is being said.  I know that this is a challenge, especially in the world of Pearl Jam.  The feel overall is more like the rawness that is captured throughout the rest of the discography.  So much of the processing effects added in the post-production phase are gone and we are left with a more living version of the original.  Put this disc in the player and you feel what it would have sounded like sitting in the booth those days with the band. . .  To me, this is what this should have been all along.  This is not to give the impression that the original was not great, and in line with the production standards of the time, but it takes some of the polish off that left a mildly muddy feel.

2158,153779,AWUMLV72KTL8O,B000002H72,kabalabonga,False,"No one who listened to the raw, churning, aggressive guitar melody of ""Levitate Me"", the first track the Pixies ever recorded (and the last cut on their first release, ""Come On Pilgrim"") could have mistaken it for a mutated sort of post-punk pop song or predicted that it would serve as a template for the quiescent/aggressive musical dynamic informing the band's iconic sound. And yet with the benefit of 25 years of hindsight, both statements seem pretty accurate to me. ""Doolittle"", the band's third release, was the apotheosis of this juxtaposition between tuneful discordancy and an undeniable melodicism underlying  hooks large enough to hang Black Francis's Size XX flannel shirts upon, and in my opinion, the finest post-punk pop release to have been recorded, period.  Most of the tracks the Pixies recorded for ""Come On Pilgrim"" and ""Surfer Rosa"", though quiescent in some parts, could be defined as possessing a sense of ferocious abandon, were often aggressively paced and frequently built toward a sense of sustained explosiveness.  And you'll still hear that on ""Doolittle"", most notably on ""Tame"" , `Wave of Mutilation"",""I Bleed"", ""Monkey Gone To Heaven"", and ""Crackity Jones"". Yet often an acoustic guitar could be heard complementing a bristling electric lead (first heard most prominently on ""Nimrod's Son"" from ""Come On  Pilgrim""). ""Doolitle"" is the first CD where the quiescent/aggressive dynamic is built solidly from this mixture of electro-acoustical guitar interplay  (their breakout song ""Here Comes Your Man"", revolves around this interplay), reaching its zenith on ""La La Love You"" and ""No. 13 Baby"", leaving no doubt they were the spiritual descendants of Husker Du by way of Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Some reviewers have criticized Francis's lyrics for opaqueness and superficiality. But to me, it's precisely those lyrics that at first glance seem cryptic- yet containing just a tiny kernel of logic that could be deciphered- that added that extra amplification to the immediacy and urgency of the sound behind it. Significantly deviant behaviors (the real-life over-the-cliff-and-into-the-ocean vehicular suicides that inspired ""Wave Of Mutilation"", the exhibitionism displayed by the ""six-foot girl"" in ""No. 13 Baby) rubs shoulders with  the spiritual (""Mr. Grieves"", perhaps drawn from Francis's Evangelical Christian upbringing, seems like an updated version of the old hymn ""Man of Sorrows"" ;""Monkey Gone To Heaven"", a severe indictment of the destruction humankind has wrought during their time spent in stewardship of the environment, juxtaposes the evolutionary fixation of mankind's supposed origins with the ascencion toward a Supreme Being after death for judgment; and both ""Dead"" a cryptical revision of David's dalliance with Bathsheba  and ""Gouge Away"" ,  a quirky re-telling of the  story of Samson and Delilah, are derived straight from the Old Testament), which brushes against the existential  ""I Bleed"", with its universal query, ""Prithee my dear/why are we here?""  that clicked with the macabre ""(Debaser"", in which the slicing of eyeballs serves as a metaphor for the degradation of society through the pornographic display of sex and violence , as well as ""Crackity Jones"", in which the song's protagonist is attempting to escape from a potentially homicidal agoraphobe). And nearly all of it is yelped, yowled, yodeled, whispered, or growled in Francis's Pentecostal roar, with Kim Deal's warm, husky vocals providing either harmony or counterpoint (and taking lead on ""Silver""). David Lovering, the band's propulsive percussionist, sings lead on ""La La Love You"", and is backed by the rest of his bandmates, giving his rich, expressive vocals a chance to serve as a focal point for once.  My review of ""Doolittle"" is the 262nd to have been added to this page, and you're probably encountering it because as of the date of its posting, it's the most recent review. Many other reviewers have stressed the influence of ""Doolittle"" as an ancestral link to the grunge movement, but I think it's a landmark recording because it incorporates significant features that are universally associated with a typical pop song with the more aggressive, discordant edge characteristic of post-punk music. Some of the rough edges have been polished away by the production values of Gil Norton, but it's only served to make ""Doolittle"" the most cohesive of the Pixies' releases; there's literally not a track without some kind of interesting wrinkle on it, and it's as compelling to listen to your thousand-and-first time as it is your first.

I bought the album and read through the lyrics before I ever listened to the album and found myself in love.  The story is magical and heart-wrenching and the writing is nearly flawless, and won me over before I even popped the album in my CD player.

OK, that was a considerable stretch, but all hyperbole aside, this is in my opinion Molly Hatchet's best album by far. And it's probably the only Molly Hatchet album a non Southern Rock fanatic will ever need, or likely want. I will concede that if you are a hardcore Southern Rock fan there are certainly other MH albums that you will want to own, and you likely already do. So, with that being said, if you are a hardcore fan there is no reason for you to ""go postal"" about this non-hardcore fan's review. So please, just grab your jug of ""shine"" and settle down.

It also contains a remake of 'Dreams I'll Never See', which is arguably their best song from any album, and certainly my favorite.

There are those artists that produce brilliant works and then a series of mediocre albums over a long haul only to ""make a come back"". Richard Thompson isn't one of those guys.

""Dream Attic"" combines the best of both worlds for most Richard Thompson fans; fans have sometimes complained that his studio albums don't capture the fire of his live playing while most of the live stuff that has been released by him is for tours in support of his studio albums and those studio albums often focus on songcraft.  Taking a page from Jackson Brown (and others who have done live albums of new material) ""Dream Attic"" is all new Thompson done with his live band. Recorded in a variety of locations, the album features Richard in strong voice and playing a number of stunning solos. The songs themselves are exceptionally good. Some of the quieter material might have worked better in the studio but truly for the ""whole"" Thompson experience they are justified played next to the rocking tunes as well.

2187,1174644,A2EC5M80VELW22,B000006J61,K. H. Orton,False,"Dino Valente was a mysterious figure on the fabled  60's Village Folk scene.  Toss him in among Fred Neil, Jackson C. Frank and Karen Dalton in terms of making an impact but never achieving the level of fame Dylan did. That said, his song ""Get Together"" (not on here) was a major hit for the Youngbloods and became a Flower Power standard.   By popular report, Valente's real name was Chester ""Chet"" Powers Jr. He was also known as Jesse Orris Farrow. Despite, ""Get Together"" and his tenure in Quicksilver Messenger Service, Dino Valente remains as enigmatic the music on this album. While some have called Valente the ""Underground Dylan"", one listen and he's nothing like Dylan. The vibe here is more akin to Astral Weeks. And one can't help but wonder if a post Them Van Morrison didn't stumble across Valente in some smoky coffee house during his trips to New York. Richie Havens has gone on record citing Valente as a major influence and one can certainly hear Valente left quite an impression on a young Tim Buckley.  Dino, whoever he was, had a serious ear for Jazz, Folk, Classical and Pop not to mention incredible phrasing as a vocalist. He also clearly smoked a ton of weed. Seems Music not stardom was on his agenda when he cut this album. Yet, while his lyrics and structures might appear stream of conscious, there is a disciplined Brill Building sense of craft at work. As he says in the album's original liner notes, "" I want my songs to have a little madness in them"". If this album has never seen it's due, it's owing to it's introspection and uniqueness. Like Tom Waits' Closing Time, or Tim Hardin's best recordings, it plays to an audience of one.  And that one is clearly a pretty lady. If Dylan was concerned with sociopolitical issues early on, Valente was all about the ladies. A bedsit Casanova and opposed to Woody Guthrie.  But have to say, ""Me And My Uncle"" is as pissed and outraged as any protest song of the period. Maybe even a shade darker than most. A major highlight can be found in the 7 minute ""Children Of The Sun"", which is as scathing as Dylan's ""Ballad Of Thin Man"" yet as romantic as ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"".  ""Tomorrow"" is another standout with it's refrain, ""When you say tomorrow, I wonder when that will be, when you are sharing this magic moment with me"". ""New Wind Blowing"" is the opposite of ""Blown' In the Wind"" with it's ""the last rose has blown and the leaves are flying"". ""New Wind"" especially brings 90's Indie luminary, the late Vic Chesnutt to mind. Surely, he must have heard this album. ""Everything Is Going To Be Okay"" with it's doomy reverb vocals and 12 string guitar betray the title but perfectly capture that point in life when nothing is secure or certain.  While it will never jump out at you, this is a very unique album that defies any 60's Village Folk expectations. Its is passionate, defiantly introspective and genuinely eccentric. This is an album you will find if you are alone and closing the blinds. Much in the way of Leonard Cohen's early work. Along with Jackson C. Frank's recordings, this is a lost classic by a lost artist which had a ton of influence on artists and albums we have all come to love. Funny thing is, no one remembers their names.

2196,683431,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B000MI1XQK,Guardian,False,"In one of the short essays printed in the CD booklet-insert, Bill Kirchner writes: ""In 20th century American music, three partnerships have been most influential: Duke Ellington/Billy Strayhorn, Frank Sinatra/Nelson Riddle, and Miles Davis/Gil Evans.""  It's no exaggeration to state that Miles Davis was in many ways the 20th century's musical equivalent of Picasso: always the innovator, pushing the boundaries of hitherto unexplored landscapes to expand what we accept as art, disregarding convention and rewriting the rules. The musical marriage with Gil Evans' structured but often radical orchestral arrangements provided the near-perfect canvas for Miles' trumpet to paint its expressive, minimalist, striking colors with bold but often melancholy brush strokes. Chalk and cheese they may have been, but together cooked up something magical. In addition they were close lifelong friends.  From first to last, the result of their collaboration in reworking Gershwin's ""Porgy and Bess"" has a serious core. The mood evoked is on the whole not joyous; it has a melancholy heart and minor keys predominate. Evans' brass-dominated orchestrations are the antithesis of smooth and restful: they are often jarring, discordant, disturbing, and work perfectly in setting the tone.  Highlights would be the downbeat opener ""Buzzard Song"" employing a sparse duet of tuba and trumpet; a mellow and rhythmic rendition of ""Summertime"" (a contrast with Trane's treatment of the same base material on his ""Favorite Things"" album is instructive); and the sublime ""It ain't necessarily so"" - each one a fine example of Evans' radical, attention-grabbing orchestration overlaid with Miles' intelligent exploration of the basic melody with a trumpet sound so clean and vital it's like a refreshing shower on the skin on a hot day.  This album may not be to everyone's taste, and does not suit every mood. However, its best moments rank as some of the greatest ever in jazz and reinforce the conviction, if any were needed, that 20th century music would not have been the same without Miles Davis.",5,"01 8, 2011",Davis and Evans rework Gershwin's operatic oddity to weave dark magic,1294444800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},2.0,,davis overlaid buzzard attention-grabbing sparse trane's bold gil minimalist base porgy taste hitherto work influential restful trumpet smooth like ever treatment evoked marriage discordant shower however duke davis/gil way cheese rework writes skin arrangement fine equivalent rhythmic moment core convention strike hot mellow riddle last rule brush orchestration exaggeration favorite orchestration many disregard paint chalk something addition contrast musical century be radical color serious state rewrite jarring song clean everyone's music refresh innovator gershwin's friends great minor thing melancholy conviction bill one exploration expressive tuba need rank american picasso whole employ partnership expand highlight suit material century's set necessarily predominate perfectly together disturb first sublime kirchner evans landscape result ain't mood album would structure heart accept melody mile cd close booklet-insert rendition essay instructive art boundary duet day sound strayhorn provide cook joyous key short summertime lifelong best often opener magical without orchestral near-perfect basic print frank reinforce tone jazz push always brass-dominated example three canvas every sinatra/nelson stroke may collaboration downbeat vital ellington/billy intelligent unexplored antithesis

The album opens with the sweet traditonal song Scarborough Fair/Canticle as arranged by the two. Patterns is a nice song about figuring out life's mysteries and never being able to completely unravel them. Cloudy is a sweet upbeat song that comes in at just the right point with it's cheerful and upbeat attitude. Homeward Bound is a sweet sad song about being stuck a long way from home while The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine is a commentary on mass marketing, advertising and popular culture. The first half of the album ends on a happy note with 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy).  The second half begins with the moving The Dangling Conversation which is a sad commentary on a dying relationship with nothing left in common. Flowers Never Bend With the Rainfall is more upbeat and can get your toe tapping. A Simple Desultory Philippic (or How I Was Robert McNamara'd into Submission) is a Dylan send up with Paul telling us he's been Rolling Stoned and Beatled till he's blind with a serious message in there too. On top of all that, he loses his harmonica. Laughs. For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her is a sweet song sung by Art Garfunkel.

After all, he has been embracing his past more and more in both his solo performances and his appearances with the Scorpions. Having said that, when I first listened to this, I wanted to give it 2 stars only. Now, I am not against the music Uli has been making the last 15 years+ or so as I do have Aquila Suite, Prolouge to the Symphonic Legends and Transcendental Sky Guitar (Parts 1 & 2) and like them all, however my expectations ruined the first listen of this CD. Then I decided to pop it in again and I am happy I did. I would most likely give this 3.5 stars if I could, only because I think ""side 1"", if you can call it that, is not nearly as good as ""side 2"". I rate the second half of this release as some of the best music he has ever created, including Electric Sun. By the way, for those expecting an Electric Sun revival, I think this CD is closer to Earthquake/Firewind than Beyond the Astral Skies (his worst release in my opinion-although still good).

Still entirely capable of improving every song he sings (the mark of a truly great singer) Jones' trademark note-bending vocals make this CD an essential purchase from anyone claiming to be a country music fan. The big draw in terms of generating sales is, of course, the duet with Garth Brooks, Beer Run. I remember reading a quote by Brooks a few years ago when, asked if he would ever duet with Jones, Brooks replied that it would, for him, be ""vocal suicide"". His fears were well-placed as Jones effortessly outclasses the biggest album seller in music history on a fun track that recalls Jones' own White Lightning. I was astonished by the sense of energy that Jones put into the fast-paced I Got Everything - he really can rock with the best of them, regardless of age. The ballad side of Jones is well represented with quality material including The Man He Was, Half Over You and the superb Honey Hush.

This CD shows that it was carefully put together. The CD opens with a choral and orchestral melody of various christmas favorites such as ""Happy Holidays"", The First Noel"", and ""I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Clause"". Karen then sings the beautiful ""Christmas Waltz"". This song really shows the mellow beauty of Karen's voice. I have heard other versions of this song. Karen Carpenters version is by far the best.  Karen's voice has a flowing ease that is very pleasing to the ear. Her voice has the quality that reminds me of the late Jim Reeves. The beauty of her voice really comes through on this CD. Very few singers have the voice that is the same quality as Karen Carpenter. Each song was beautifully arranged. These songs include ""Have your self a merry little Christmas"", ""The Christmas Song"" and ""Home for the Holidays"" plus many others. Richard Carpenter does a very spirited piano solo on ""The Carol of the Bells"". There is also the Carpenters signature christmas song ""Merry Christmas Darling"". ""Sleep well little children"" is a beautiful lullaby (Its part of a melody that includes the spirited ""Its Christmas time""). This CD is a very uplifting.

2223,211148,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000002KOE,Busy Body,False,"Joni Mitchell's debut album was released in 1968. Called ""Song To A Seagull,"" it is one of Joni's most underrated accomplishments, as well as one of her lesser known. The album is divided into two parts, I Came To The City and Out Of The City And Down To The Seaside, with five songs on each side. I bought this album a few months ago, and was instantly impressed with it from the first time I heard it. The simplicity of the music and the sound, along with Joni's beautifully harmonious vocal delivery is truly a powerful thing to treasure. This album is almost forty years old and it still sounds amazing. With all the rubbish around in today's charts, it's incredibly refreshing to go back to basics with something like this album.  This album is filled with so many beautiful hooks that just grab you right from the moment you hear them. It's an album to listen to in isolation. I could get lost for days in the middle of nowhere with this album and fall in love with Joni over and over again. This woman was a legend in the making, and the rate of her output in the Seventies confirmed her true talents. It all began here. On this album everything's not quite fully formed. Joni is still unaware of her true capabilities, but it's so wonderful to hear the potential in her voice, her words and her melodies.  The album opens with the stunning ""I Had A King."" This song deals with a failing relationship, with lyrics such as ""I can't go back there anymore, you know my keys won't fit the door, you know my thoughts don't fit the man, they never can."" I love the vocal emphasis in the verses, it makes me want to wail along. Incredibly healing, almost liberating. ""Michael From Mountains"" is a more mid-tempo song with lush guitar sections interspersed with Joni's hearty delivery. There's not as much melody to this song, which means it will take longer to grow on you, but it's one of the best on offer here. The imagery is truly stunning, this song is a painting in audio form. ""Night In The City"" is one of the more upbeat songs here, and it's incredibly beautiful. On a recent trip to the Greek island of Zakynthos, I listened to this song when I was taking a taxi ride through back roads and little villages. The song just seemed to fit what I was seeing, and I listened to it on repeat for about an hour. It's about two and a half minutes long, very simplistic in style and has a wonderful melody. Joni's voice is incredible, it rises higher and higher to the sun where it becomes truly sunlit. I love the chorus, ""Night in the city looks pretty to me, night in the city looks fine, music comes spilling out into the street, colors go flashing in time,"" and especially where she provides her own backing vocals which repeat the chorus a moment after she first began to sing it. ""Marcie"" is another incredible song about a woman waiting for love to come knocking at her door, in the form of a letter from her love interest. The words here are poetry. Beautiful poetry. Joni is a true literature-genius and lines such as ""Marcie's faucet needs a plumber, Marcie's sorrow needs a man"" reveal such depth when put into context with the subject matter. ""Nathan La Franeer"" shocked me when I first heard it. The sirens used in this song are so evocative and rather scary in their brash and jarring appearance. This song ends side one with the true account of a bitter citydwelling taxi driver Joni once encountered.  Side two begins with the sublime ""Sisotowbell Lane,"" a slow and relaxing song that reminds me a slow lullaby. Joni's luminous vocals rise and fall when she sings, ""We have a rocking chair, sometimes we rock and stare."" The guitar work almost puts me in a trance because it has this repetitious nature to it that makes me want fall asleep - in the good way! ""The Dawntreader"" is yet another incredible song. The lyrics are just pure, lush poetry, gem after gem, I mean, just get a load of this: ""Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions, gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor."" She just sings! There's no pretence here, no awkward, big-headed ego that you get with a lot of singers from that time. Joni was far ahead of her time, and this album proves it. ""The Pirate Of Penance"" is notable for the arrangement of the vocals, which suddenly speed up when she sings, for example, ""She dances for the sailors in a smoky cabaret bar underground."" The song is sung from the perspective of Penance Crane, The Dancer and Penance. The backing vocals are also some of the main lyrics, quite weird to describe, but I'm pretty sure Alanis Morissette got her idea for ""Front Row"" from something like this! ""Song To A Seagull,"" the album's title track is another beautiful song. This is incredibly simple and slow, and stunning because Joni's vocals rise and fall on every other line. It makes the melody quite predictable, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The album closes with ""Cactus Tree,"" an astonishing song which has become a Joni-standard. Joni sings, ""There's a man who's climbed a mountain and he's calling out her name, and he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles, he calls again. He can think her there besides him, he can miss her just the same."" The imagery is representative of life down by the sea.  OVERALL GRADE: 10/10  I wasn't going to give this album a perfect ten, but all ten songs are truly stunning and very strong overall. Infact, I think it's one of the most impressive debut albums I've ever heard. You don't get much better than Joni Mitchell when it comes to singer/songwriters, and this album - albeit not the best representation of her formidable talent - is pure art of the highest order. It's Sixties, it's simple, it's life, and it has the most lush coastal imagery. This is definitely a desert island disc. I could just bawl my eyes out in sheer exhilaration because the music is so pure and innocent, something Joni is legendary for.

However, they still, of course, have the good ol keyboard and awesome guitar solos. Alexi throws out some awesome solos on this album, as well as Roope. I'm also pleased with the lyrics, as they head more towards death, like Hatebreeder and FTR, which Bodom is about.  1. Living Deadbeat - 6/5 - One of my favorites of the album, uses keyboards for an atmospheric effect. Catchy chorus. Second favorite song.  2. Are You Dead Yet? - 4/5 - Catchy Chorus, other parts of song are kind of annoying. Solo's too short.  3. If You Want Peace...Prepare for War! - 6/5 - Very agressive song, and even has a triple solo with Roope, Alexi, and Janne. This is tied with Bed of Razors for my favorite Bodom song. The solos on this song go forever. Perfect song to listen to when you're mad or want to hear loud heavy music.  4. Punch Me, I Bleed - 4/5 - The slow song, has an awesome solo, but other parts could have been better. I like Angels Don't Kill better as far as slow songs go.  5. In Your Face - 4/5 - This song is growing on me. I didn't like it much at first but now it's awesome. more atmospheric keyboards, and chrous is catchy. Only part i don't like is ""I don't give a flying f**k motherf****r""  6. Next In Line - 5/5 - Took a little bit for me to like this one too, but the solo just drew me in.

Love the lyrics, especially ""Don't need a reason, and i won't tell you why...""  9. We're Not Gonna Fall - 5/5 - The song itself is worth 4 out of 5, but i gave it 5 because of the solo.

2225,1194262,A39PCD4D9R1C16,B00000DFL5,Armindo,False,"Although one can name many exceptional performances of this rare artist throughout her long career, what makes Parisina so special is the vocal line of this beautiful soprano role which fits Caballe to a tee. I'm surprised the opera isn't performed more often. It definitely ranks among my favourite Donizetti works. It's grand, dramatic and full of beautiful duets and cavatinas. We're fortunate enough that all three landmark performances of this opera with Pobbe, Caballe and Devia in the title role have something to offer.  In '74 Caballe was at her considerable best. Her aristocratic phrasing was fully developed and supported brilliantly by her technique. What always amazes me is that with less high notes than others but with more attention to the music, Caballe had complete control of her audience. She could gain more applause and attention by milking a long phrase while others would have to fill the scene with high notes to win the audience. And Parisina offers her all the opportunities to do her tricks.  Queler however spoils the finale by increasing the tempo suddenly and too much. I also prefer Caballe's earlier ending (on the studio recording) to the one she opted for this night but it's still an interesting alternative. Her highest notes by '74 were no longer as pleasant but the audience still enjoys them. In any case, this remains one of my favourite Caballe recordings.  Unfortunately the rest of the cast is not up to her par. I've never warmed up to Quilico's unitalian voice though he does his best while Pruett is acceptable but nothing impressive. Both Pobbe's and Devia's Parisina recordings have better supporting casts (Cioni, Fioravanti, Zancanaro, Karvakos) and Devia is at least as good as Caballe.  Myto sound is not the best by the way (and by far not the cheapest) so you might want to try other sources of this performance.

It marked their first commercial success in the states and placed them on the very successful mega-arena Family Values Tour 1998.

Rammstein return with, well, just what you would expect from Rammstein. Grinding guitars, pulsating drums and that classic german growl. Only this time around, it is wearing thin. For me to be able to enjoy a band's music, I have to be able to relate to or understand the views and emotions that are being displayed by the band through lyrics, which is the problem with Rammstein: You cannot understand a word they are saying. Now that's not saying they don't have anything important to say, but I just cannot understand a single word they say, which made it very hard for me to enjoy this album. Many times bands can translate emotion through the music, guitars are usually the case, and a lot of times the piano is incorporated. Rammstein have yet to acquire either of these elements.

2236,44603,ATB0XR95PD14A,B000001EKV,D. Haralson,False,"I know that is a bold statement, but the only other band to release a debut album that caught the entire world off guard was Black Sabbath.  In both instances, there had bever been anything like these debut albums before.  The first Kiss album holds a very special place in every Kiss fan's heart, because it has more of the Kiss Klassics than any other album.  1. Strutter-5/5.  This is one of the greatest of all Kiss songs and is still played live today.  An upbeat, fast paced song with excellent lyrics, vocals and music.  This one is sang by Paul.  Superb.  2. Nothing To Lose-5/5.  This one isn't as well known, but it is still one of the best on here.  The lyrics are a bit vulgar and suggestive, but that was part of Kiss' trademark.  The vocals by Gene and Peter are excellent.  Upbeat and bluesy music.  3. Firehouse-5/5.  Another live staple that is still played today.  This one is a bit slower but very cool.  Excellent vocals by Paul.  4. Cold Gin-5/5.  One of the best songs in Kiss' history.  Written by Ace and sang by Gene, the music is a bit slower and groovy, with a bit of a bluesy feel to it, with classic rock and roll lyrics.  5. Let Me Know-5/5. Written by Paul and sung by both Gene and Paul, this is another underrated classic similar to Nothin' To Lose.  Excellent music and vocals, although the lyrics aren't as great as on other songs.  6. Kissin' Time-3/5.  This one has gotten a bad rap over the years by both fans and the band themselves.  Kiss usually didn't do cover songs all that well.  The problem with this song is that the lyrics are stupid.  Gene, Paul and Peter sing them as best they can, but they didn't really want to do this in the first place and it shows.  7. Deuce-5/5.  Written and sung by Gene, this is one of the greatest of all Kiss songs.  It also contains one of Ace's best solos.  Great music and vocals with silly nonsensical lyrics.  8. Love Theme From KISS-4/5.  Interesting instrumental interlude.  Kiss would never do this sort of thing again, but it isn't bad.  It is slow and groovy with an interesting riff.  9. 100,000 Years-5/5.  This is another great Kiss Klassic.  It is even better on the Alive album.  The lyrics don't make much sense, but they feel right and the music and vocal performances are near perfect.  10. Black Diamond-5/5.  This is probably my favorite Kiss song ever.  The music is perfect, Peter's vocals are perfect and the lyrics are great.  It can either be about the city, life in the city, or a prostitute.  In any case, it is, in my opinion, the greatest song by Kiss.  Even better on Alive!

Consequently, I grew up listening to his folksy, warm voice singing ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"", ""Secretly"", ""Waltzing Matilda"", ""Ring-A-Ling-A-Lario"", ""Honeycomb"", and ""Woman From Liberia"". I always loved it when my mother played his album, and over the years it stayed with me until I, too, decided I would listen to his music and bought this outstanding CD.  Jimmie Rodgers always thought of himself primarily as a folk singer, yet most of the songs he sang were country flavored pop tunes because that was where the market was. His lilting, mellow voice was able to cross over easily to another genre of music, making him one of the most popular entertainers of the time.  Unfortunately, in late 1967, his career was derailed by an off-duty policeman in California who stopped him, ostensibly for driving erratically. What happened next was never made clear. Suffice to say, Jimmie Rodgers spent the better part of a year in a hospital with traumatic head injuries, a turn of events which impacted substantially on his career, as it took him several years to recuperate.

I'm still thrilled when a band from the era releases a new disc...last year's Alice in Chains' reunion album was amazing.  Admittedly, I felt a bit uneasy about STP's self titled comeback once I heard the lead single, Between the Lines.  Not that the track is bad, it's just not very strong.  Thankfully, there are a variety of strengths present.  Many fans notice how different each album by STP is.  Well, I kind of feel like each song on this new one is different.  ""Take a load off"" feels like a song from Purple, and even has a ""yeeahh"" thrown in reminiscent of Core.  ""Huckleberry Crumble"" is shamelessly an Aerosmith sounding song.  But, it's fun.  ""Dare if you Dare"" I think is the best song on the album.  It reminds me of ""Glide"" from No. 4.  Other standout tracks are ""peacoat, fast as I can, and maver.""  While the muscular, grunge driven guitars are gone, the replacement of tight grooves and exceptional vocals by Scott Weiland more than compensate.  This is there best album since Purple.

2254,1285841,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0002ONC4U,Mark Barry,False,"With hippy-dip titles like ""Uno Transito Clapori"" and ""Nymphenburger""  Englands East Of Eden weren't exactly aiming for Top Of The Pops or Radio 1's playlist with their second Progressive Rock album release ""Snafu"" in February 1970. Yet thats exactly where they ended up more than a year and two months later (via a circuitous route).  To draw attention to the LP - East of Eden and Deram popped out the non-album 7 single ""Jig-A-Jig"" in May 1970 and by way of slow radio play and build up - they eventually entered the UK charts in April 1971. It wasn't long before they were giving it a bit of Rock-Fiddle instrumental on Top Of The Pops while Pans People danced about in scantily clad outfits to its cod-Irish rhythms (lovely). More importantly the single got them noticed. Taking a clever edit of ""Marcus Junior"" (the 2nd part of the 2nd track on the album) as its B-side  this most weird and Prog of British bands suddenly found they had a hit on their hands  a little like Thin Lizzy would do in 1973 with the Traditional Irish air of ""Whisky In The Jar"". And thats where this 2008 CD remaster comes in. Armed with a generous seven bonus tracks (five of which are Previously Unreleased) and a near eighty-minute playing time  here are the jiggy details  UK released March 2008  ""Snafu"" by EAST OF EDEN is a CD remaster on Esoteric Recordings ECLEC 2034 (Barcode 5013929713420) and breaks down as follows (78:04 minutes).  1. Have To Whack It Up 2. (a) Leaping Beauties For Rudy (b) Marcus Junior 3. (a) Xhorkom (b) Ramadhan (c) In The Snow For A Blow (Medley) Part I (d) Better Git It In Your Soul (e) In The Snow For A Blow (Medley) Part III 4. Uno Transito Clapori 5. (a) Gum Arabic (b) Confucius [Side 2] 6. Nymphenburger 7. (a) Habibi Baby (b) Beast Of Sweden (c) Boehm Constrictor 8. Traditional: Arranged By East of Eden Tracks 1 to 8 are their 2nd album ""Snafu""  released February 1970 in the UK on Deram DML 1050 (Mono) and SML 1050 (Stereo) and in the USA on Decca DES 18043 (Stereo only)  BONUS TRACKS: 9. Jig-A-Jig (May 1970 UK 7"" single on Deram DM 297, A  charted April 1971) 10. Petite Fille  Previously Unreleased 11. Biffin Bridge  Previously Unreleased 12. Blue Boar Blues  Previously Unreleased 13. Nymphenburger  First Take 14. Marcus Junior (Single Edit)  B-side of ""Jig-A-Jig"" 15. Jig-A-Jig (Take Nine)  Previously Unreleased  Co-ordinated and Produced by MARK POWELL - the 12-page booklet features trade adverts and reviews for UK and French Music Magazines, three rare foreign pictures sleeves, colour live shots of the band on the centre pages, track-by-track musician credits and the albums original liner notes. There aren't liner notes per say  but all that pales into naught when you clap your ears on the PASCHAL BYRNE remaster from original tapes (done at Audio Archiving in the UK). This CD sounds amazing - making the dense flute, electric violin and saxophone playing seem somehow more open (same crew did the debut album from 1969 ""Mercator Projected""  also on Esoteric Recordings).  In truth - the album ""Snafu"" couldn't be more different from the crowd pleaser of ""Jig-A-Jig"".  What you get here is Flute and Saxophone Prog Rock with the Fiddle Playing of Dave Arbus taking centre stage. Four of its long tracks come in parts  often going off into Free Jazz passages. Stuff like ""Uno Transito Clapori"" with its near 3-minutes of backward tape-effects are unlistenable nonsense now  but far better is the Jethro Tull Flute-Rock of ""Gum Arabic/Confucius"" which boogies along impressively for eight minutes or so with some hippy talking pieces inbetween. Nymphenburger has Arbus playing six violins while Geoff Nicholson plays four guitars and its awkward rhythms are a bit laboured. It ends on the 1:35 minutes of Piano and Voice on ""Traditional"" which is ""Xhorkom"" played the right way around.  The bonus tracks are going to please especially the surprisingly soft Petite Fille which is almost madrigal in its simplicity. Biffin Bridge is closest to the albums Prog Rock  a slow intro arrives at a great Fiddle and Guitar workout  while Blue Boar Blues sounds like Mick Abraham's Blodwyn Pig circa ""Ahead Rings Out"".  Fans who remember the band with affection should jump at this reissue  especially given those excellent extras and that great audio upgrade...

2257,149304,A3VXBO4QQX3ZG8,B000002C31,Steven Haarala,True,"This is my first in-depth experience with Leonard Cohen, so you who are accustomed to his work will have to forgive my naive enthusiasm.  I have never heard anything so serious in my life.  The best comparison that I can come up with is that this artist combines the intellect of Bob Dylan with the delivery of Marianne Faithfull.  This is poetry;  it is bleak, it is depressing, it is horrifying, it is humorous, it is beautiful.  Any thinking person needs to hear this.  Actually a lot more people need to hear it, but unfortunately I believe that the very ones who need to hear it are the ones who will choose to ignore it.  The tracks cover a wide (to put it mildly) range of topics done in a variety of musical styles, difficult to describe.  ""Everybody Knows"" is a pretty accurate view of our corrupt society, delivered in an appropriately cynical voice accompanied by appropriately sinister  music.  ""Tower of Song"" is more personal, seemingly about someone who is imprisoned by his circumstances.  The music, including the backup singing, sounds lighter, perhaps because the victim has accepted his fate.  Another personal song, ""Suzanne"", is the one I was most familiar with before buying this CD.  A straight-up folk song, it weaves sex, religion and social issues together to form an unforgettable portrait of a girl who is ""...half crazy/but that's why you want to be there.""  (The funny thing is, hearing this song again reminds me of a girl I knew very well by the same name, so, Suzanne, if you are reading this, you know who you are!)  Black humor is in full force as ""Democracy"" comes to the USA, to the tune of a military march.  And you know ""The Future"" will be grim if the singer prefers the near past and the present (crack, the Berlin Wall, Stalin, Hiroshima) to the worse future he describes as ""murder"".  The finality of the reality eventually arrives in ""Closing Time"", a mid-tempo square-dance country number which contains still more black humor:  ""And the whole damn place goes crazy twice/and it's once for the Devil and it's once for Christ/but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights - we're busted in the blinding lights/of closing time.""

2259,599505,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007PLKS4,Grady Harp,False,"David Zinman keeps a low profile and aims all of his energies toward making music, and 'making music' is precisely what he accomplishes in this set of all four of Robert Schumann's symphonies.  While there are other individual recordings and some complete collections of these works that have found favor with the Romantic audience, this set provides Zinman and his Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra the access to the top of the mound!  Schumann's life and work are the topics of many poets, writers, critics, and scholars and at times his melancholia and sad demise overshadow his exemplary compositions.  While most accept him as one of the most important lieder composers, standing proudly beside Schubert and Hugo Wolf, his symphonies are often consider pass. But Zinman and his orchestra grandly demonstrate that far from being secondary works, these four symphonies rival the majesty and imagination of Brahms, Mendelssohn, and even Mahler and Beethoven? Heresy? Just listen to these very alive, illuminating  readings of these forward looking works and hear your ears and heart change their minds.  Each of the four works stands equally, though many (as this listener) may find the treasureable Spring Symphony (No. 1) the crowning performance.  Zinman favors brisk tempi, clarity of phrasing, and the rapture of the Romantic vision and the result is simply some of the finest orchestral playing and sound on recording. Add to this the inexpensive price tag for this 2 CD set and there leaves no reason not to build your library with works that deserve a prime position. The recorded sound is rich and full while delineating every detail and nuance.  Highly Recommended.

The two things that annoyed me the most about this cd were the production and the lack of songs. There were only 15 including the bonus ""Just Another Day."" Compared to other Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit releases its short, I think there should've been atleast 17. And the 15 that are there isn't anything new either. It's basically the same thing you would find on Get Rich or Die Tryin, except its not as good. You've got On Fire which is a club banger like In Da Club. Can I Get High is your everyday rap song about weed just like 50 cent's High All the Time. Then of course there has to be atleast one track with Eminem and Nate Dogg. Like I said before, the production on this cd was poor compared to Beg For Mercy and Get Rich or Die Tryin. Although some of the songs like Can I Get High, I'm So Fly, Work Magic  and the three Eminem produced songs have above average beats, some songs like Playboy,  just sound horrible. The beat on that song just annoys the hell out of me. About half the beats are low grade mainly because most were from underground producers. Some sounded like they were meant for mixtapes. Considering Banks and the G-Unit went 2x Platinum I think they could've been able to afford better beats, after all this was one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year.  Even though I like everysong except Playboy, I think the beats should've been better. Another thing that made the cd worse was Banks inability to make good hooks, the best one that he did was probably on Work Magic. I think it was a good thing to have 50 and Nate Dogg and Joe do some of the hooks. This album isn't bad, I still recomend to buy it, but I was just expecting alot more. Considering Banks is the best lyricist in the G-Unit, and he has a cold, rough voice he shouldn't have followed the 50 cent formula, he should've made a harder more serious album. I mean come on The Rap Lebron can rap about anything, even Popeye. The dvd was a dissipointment save your money and get the regular edition, the special case and dvd aren't worth the money, unless you wanna see cartoon boobies in the My Buddy video.

She entered the music business as Missy Elliott's proteg&eacute;, has two good--if not, great--albums under her belt, she's done numerous hooks for an array of artists and she's had quite a few hits herself, the most notable being ""Superwoman, Pt. II"" with Fabolous. Mo has never been a huge seller, but she has a very solid fanbase that continues to support her. Her songwriting skills are great, her voice is wonderfully unique and her gospel-tinged harmonies add the perfect touch to her songs.  Only a short while after the release of her sophomore album, Meet the Girl Next Door, Elektra Records folded and Lil' Mo was left without a record deal. (It was only a matter of time because Elektra was going downhill and quickly.) She went on to host a very successful radio talk show in the meantime. Around 2004, though, she came back and announced that she was now signed to Universal/Cash Money Records. She released four singles, three of which had videos. Unfortunately, she did not get proper promotion, the singles did not see success and her label soon decided to shelf her album, Syndicated: The Lil' Mo Hour. (Which I still don't get. If you spend that much money on videos and singles, wouldn't it only make sense to release the album and hope for some revenue?) Once again, she was dropped.  So what's an underrated R&B singer to do when she's been criminally dropped from a major label twice? Mo, being the wise business woman she is, decided to do things her way and formed her own independent label, HoneyChild Inc. (And use Koch Records for distribution.) Smart move! And after not that long a wait, Pain & Paper has finally been released.  Between this and her last album, Lil' Mo has had a lot of pain and drama. Children, divorce, record label problems and industry friends/collaborators cheating her out of money and betraying her. (ahemJaRuleahem) So the title is rather fitting. The subject matter of the songs also makes it fitting; the album has songs about love triangles, death, wanting to get with a best friend, leaving a man with a wife, dating a much younger guy, cheating and various types of heartbreak.  There are some gems here, like the gospel influenced ""Dotted I (I'm Not Perfect)"" and the upbeat ""Officially Hollywood"" but unfortunately the rest of the songs are just... okay. There are too many ballads, the album's a bit too long, it needs a re-sequence, some of the production is stale or second rate-sounding, and most of the songs are nice, but not very memorable. The lyrics are sometimes cheesy, too. (Is she seriously sampling Napoleon Dynamite's trademark 'lucky' on ""Lucky Her."" Don't get me started about ""Youngin'."") Lil' Mo's voice and delivery is great as usual, it's just that the material is not all top notch.  The album is still above average, and any fan should go support Lil' Mo and buy this.

2286,1414314,A1H7ERH12850OS,B00EQK5PD2,Corneille,True,"It was a long time that listening to a new album happens to draw such an intense emotional response from me.  Maybe it never really happened before this one.  And to be honest, I was hoping for a long time (and knowing) that Ihsahn would do such an album.  Ihsahn is a shy, nice and reserved man from what I know.  But he managed to rip himself out and exhibit his soul crushed by the music and succeed to make us feel the way he feels, and that's pretty rare.  Of course, it takes an open mind and no prejudice to fully appreciate, but it's rare that a ""metal"" artist invites his listeners to share the core of his inspirational source.  I would say that I prefer that approach.  I love authenticity.  Thank you Ihsahn.  I never managed to review his previous output, Eremita.  This album was the Epilogue of the A trilogy.  It resumes and assumes and it closes.  While appreciating the music of that opus, I never saw the necessity to hold forth on an epilogue, even if Eremita was filled with promises for the things to come.  With Das Seelenbrechen, a whole new scope is deploying before our eyes.  And I was waiting for that vision to be put forth again.  Did I say new and again?  Yes, this is a new sound to some extent but a vision coming from the past.  A vision that has always haunted Ihsahn's creating process.  A lot of ideas and tones on Das Seelenbrechen are drawn from older works, being Thou Shalt Suffer (both eras), and Peccatum, particularly.  These were side projects were Ihsahn allowed himself to explore and experiment at the times, even if I never felt him as free as he seems to be on this eponym's fifth release.  It's like this album is infused with those influences but seasoned with Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk's drive.  Maybe it's just me, but the whole aura of Das Seelenbrechen brings back the Anthems vibe to me, and it's a pleasure.  Here he goes, throwing himself into the fury of Hiber (winter) with ominous filmcore keyboard resounding like a Mussorgsky's night and echoing TSS Somnium in its calmer section.  But Hiber is nothing when Regen insinuate his melancholic piano and Ihsahn singing with a distant voice that leads into bombastic deployment of brass and violins displaying a level of epicness that will be the peak of the album for that matter.  And when you're on the top, you abruptly drop into salt.  Yes, that's a seasoned opus let me tell you.  Every now and the on the album, you'll fall abruptly.  Why?  Hence, the production differs from song to song, the style, the rhythm, the singing and the instrumentation, all differs to a point that some will say this is not a coherent album.  What is coherence?  Does art needs to be coherent? Hopefully not.  But, this it what makes an album coherent, unexpected encounters, sweetness being merged with chaos, poetry surfing the noise.  Like said further in the lyrics ""That being broken is what makes it whole"" (Pulse).  After an amount of listening, depending on who is the listener, the album will unfold its cohesion, and the omnipresent cinematic shadow will reveal the hidden structure, the story line behind the veil.  This is the scenario of the fall and the loss.  How one can lose himself into music, whatever it's listening to it or creating it.  How one can fall in the imagery that music can spark.  It's started with the fall of winter (Hiber), the loss of light (Regen), the loss of illusions (NaCl), the loss of equilibrium (Pulse), the fall into madness (Tacit 2), the loss of beacons (Tacit), the loss of the mind (Rec), the wait for death to come (M), the despair in which you drown (Sub Ater), and when the eyes disappeared ultimately, the end (See).  So for now we're into salt, rather NaCl.  A change of rhythmic, but not so far from those once heard on the Peccatum records, hence the very reminiscent guitar bridge that seems to be ripped of ""Lost in Reverie"" Stillness.  Is there contempt towards others or self-derision?  I think it's both from the weird lyrical theme of that song where Ihsahn exhibits some of his best cleans ever.  It's a pretty impressive prog rock song that leads to the next song, which is a pretty impressive ballad, too.  I've said it before, though it's far from being a wish, that Ihsahn would be able to put out a pretty decent pop song and get aired, but his lyrical themes would deprive him from a radio hit, although I think a lot of people could match on Pulse lyrics.  But who is paying attention to lyrics these days?  Even if Pulse music is quite a leap from what we've heard before from the man, the simple music line, the haunting lyrics could live on their own since they're such an ear worm. Pulse acts just like it's your favorite song, suave, sober in structure and strangely sensual.  Is it dark trip hop, or just the leitmotiv of Ihsahn's psyche?  Speaking of Ihsahn's psyche, the next song is the counterpart or musically the counterpoint to Pulse, the dark side of Ihsahn's psyche.  He was not able to let the listener in the sweet and brooding mood of Pulse, so he rushes into the chaos and madness of improvisation in Tacit 2.  Some could think this is a forbidding track, it may be.  But, this is a necessary break into the ""logic"" of the album.  To break the mood of beauty installed with the last three songs and explore ugliness.  Tacit 2 has little structure and no melody, and it's one the most black metal song Ihsahn ever did.  Don't expect tremolo picking or blast beats, though.  Tacit 2 is a terror inducing piece, built on towering drumming by Tobias rnes Andersen and Ihsahn's screams darker than ever.  Lyrically, it's the poet's complaint over his attempts to reach an apex, and the letdowns he feels towards its failure to succeed, as he would have wished.  Such violence in the nature of the sound Tacit 2 has, and such sorrow in the lyrics.  Tacit follows Tacit 2.  Why in that order?  Possibly because Tacit was composed before Tacit 2 was improvised.  But, since the purpose of this opus is to crush, Pulse needed to be crush by the chaos of ugliness, before that the second part of the album takes off with Tacit.  This one being filled with drive and urge, as a typically Ihsahn song often is, a bit like Hiber, but with more despair in the voice than aggression.  A despair that tries to be swept away by the Big Band orchestra sound interlude that relates another suffering of the creating process, and the lyrics that describe accurately the ""soulscapes"" Ihsahn feels: ""To feel destruction and play the sound"".  That resumes the man's vision to a certain point.  As we rest on a field of ruins, the seventh song, Rec begins quietly with a piano line, and Ihsahn muttering obscure lyrics and then the song builds onto unsettling crescendo turning itself into an industrial piece of music recalling again the Peccatum's days (Lost in Reverie era).  This is maybe the shortest song that he ever did.  But after several listen, this little piece of music and noise reveals itself to be far more disturbing than any of the others six previous songs.  The lyrics are those of a man that has gone to far and lost his mind in his so called creating process.  To this point, the listener feels that all is lost, and there is no redemption in sight, and that the album will drown in murk and confusion for good.  And this is exactly what it does! With the next one M, the muttering words continue, each word being a cut as each cut being a word until the dull words enumeration paves the way to a wonderful guitar solo, recalling some of Pink Floyd's, but in a much darker mood, as the voice continues to ask by ""how many"" cuts will you die ...  This song, like the previous is more of a fragment, spoken words, guitar solo and that's all.  And that's not what one could expect from Ihsahn.  Thank you again Ihsahn, to deceive our expectations for to transform them into the pure joy of astonishment.  If M draws joy despite the malevolence that oozes from it, Sub Ater (under the black) put forth one of the main emotions of the opus, discomfort.  Referring, always, to the creating process and inspirational source, this one finds our protagonist to be ""crushed between the teeth of a drunken poet smile"", a poet that sips the blood to the point he retches.  Strong image, upsetting music, acoustic guitar that echoes some of Starofash's works, for who's got the chance to know.  Sub Ater is a downward spiral to bleakness and disarray.  Nothing can be done against the muse's vise when it holds you between its jaws.  Just surrender.  Surrender to see.  See is the last song of the standard issue of Das Seelenbrechen.  With all the darkness painted by Sub Ater, there is nothing left to see, except the disappearing of the eyes through a vain and desperate fleeing amidst this musical improvisation and drone like, deconstructing the whole creating process.  Deconstructing the whole Ihsahn mold.  Deceiving some fans, exhilarating others.  Musically, this is the most keyboards driven album that Ihsahn has done since Anthems, but it has some of the best guitar soli heard in all the man's career.  The drumming of Tobias rnes Andersen is quite impressive and he's the framework to most of the album.  Ihsahn's voice is in top shape, better than ever, in my opinion.  His cleans are fully restrained, pure and silken, yet his screams sound the most natural they ever sounded in his solo years.  Sometimes, they even remind me the younger Ihsahn, when his voice was not fully matured, adding more spontaneity and urge to the whole picture.  Reading some reviews here and there before writing mine, you know, because the album got an earlier release in Europe, I notice that most of the people tended to dismiss the album second half, claiming it is too weird, that the songs don't reach a climax or are getting nowhere.  I my personal case, I do prefer the second half, the songs, especially Rec, M and Sub Ater bring me in an ethereal state, lost in reverie.  A somber reverie, delectably deliquescent as the purpose of Das Seelenbrechen is to break the soul, and the mold. Yes, the first half of Das Seelenbrechen is also exploring other paths, but songs are catchy as hell, especially NaCl and Pulse.  They melt sweet and a bit acidulated on the tongue. The taste of the last six songs is far more challenging and disturbing. I love that the second half songs don't reach their climax and instead are instilling discomfort.  Glimpse of beauty drowned in confusion.  It's an atmospheric, disturbing and introspective experience that if you totally invest in, will reveal surprisingly rewarding.  Ihsahn, he loves music, and it shows.  He remains faithful to the dark source of his inspiration and it feels.",5,"11 4, 2013",True artwork!,1383523200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},10.0,,crescendo man's accurately hiber go manage fragment leitmotiv maybe i've hell taste onto spoken counterpart deployment scream notice poet's who's theme ever say approach heard tend rhythmic interlude image sweep seasoned time amidst last get lyrically favorite many expect seelenbrechen happen disarray solo desperate ear we're teeth atmospheric possibly starofash's song totally madness rec idea really draw picture orchestra despite inspiration part disappear extent surrender tell infuse industrial calmer rip point cut let far yes explore eremita unsettling insinuate crush smile bit continue drown theme would metal andersen particularly explore disappear response work enumeration young hit band glimpse upset welkin picking lead release violence sound hide ultimately sips experience show main necessity air filmcore process broken build instrumentation saw bombastic close shortest somber drown haunt follow call happens noise do they're every may lose exhilarate framework wish review know rip away lyrics somnium soul black joy much radio apex amount drive rock tongue act record create echo confusion like leap suave refer improvise level sub shadow suffer section unexpected influence could start nowhere shy come salt counterpoint open listen hold relate tss nothing several dark contempt shape exhibit wait thou compose musical melt vision state blood quietly acoustic omnipresent well dismiss long echo drunken surprisingly loss mussorgsky's discomfort one introspective death love new whatever cohesion beat whole impressive lyrical haunt sweet urge reminiscent ihsahn's day attempt dull promise first exhibit deploy turn pleasure certain inducing letdown obscure time rhythm top brooding felt also decent experiment match pay ominous attention voice see remind solo forth ooze typically drop year fury listener resounding side reach paint terror case merge appreciate need ethereal catchy style sight authenticity since failure resume die vain keyboard story yet sensual downward though emotional take behind eras reveals protagonist ask deceive fill throw invest always three murk exactly climax reserve personal worm begin expectation he's rather coherent ballad second transform nice mature weird astonishment build listener artist break natural europe prog career poetry order intense driven drum prefer piano pave melancholic song anthems half epicness write jaw forbid think core others night next destruction clean we've beacon pink seem change floyd's big veil knowing structure output trilogy fan appreciate tacit although invite draw music leave tobias word little thing course scope lot blast go back challenge stillness delectably spontaneity hence try vibe able free good shalt allow silken add ihsahn reveal poet coherence sorrow scenario unfold mind mood imagery get cinematic retch tone standard dusk's ater sometimes faithful encounter thank succeed find deconstruct eponym's art differs man self-derision psyche surf make strangely despair bridge hop reward vise field aura piece continue redemption word best distant often beauty previous come wonderful rnes instal deceive tremolo say another prejudice strong rush illusion fall tower track peccatum abruptly read pop chance aggression keyboard quite recall way remain chaos seventh deprive da complaint depend display share emotion six nature towards spark feel simple acidulate instilling eye inspirational malevolence feel project mine logic ruin source earlier line put ugliness improvisation hop that's brings rare play pure need issue wait drone equilibrium sweetness live lose singing opus disturb flee sounded bleakness assumes light fully listen love hopefully claim especially album fifth epilogue drawn melody crush hold restrain peak winter speaking production wish honest path even necessary darker matter musically brass rest mold except opinion guitar soulscapes purpose deliquescent mutter peccatum's never reverie cut bring review darkness describe muse's violin regen instead end make sober trip people nacl suffer past get spiral old pulse era pretty

Pinilla Suarez,False,"The beautiful TURANDOT is illuminated with golden brilliance in this recording of the master Von Karajan with a casting of his more dear singers with the orchestra that he loved: The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Controversial it continues being his selection, Katia Riciarelli, for the principal role, but curiously the most obvious reason has not treated: Turandot is a dazzling woman as to be charmed with to the hero Calaf. And besides beautiful voice the Riciarelli she was a very attractive, ideal woman thinking probably about a scenic representation. If it is not possible to to compare with Nilsson or Marton, her aria is very lyrically sung and the ""grido"" is convincing. Another thing and less debatable it is that probably this role harmed her for her later works. Plcido Domingo is domineering and touching as the prince Calaf.

2289,628445,A25JHXYK10F0A6,B000BBOVGC,Thomas D. Ryan,False,"Damn, where's he been? For thirty years, Isaac Hayes has apparently been one of the coolest people on the planet Earth, but he's rarely seen, and only heard as a voice on a crazy cartoon show. This CD lets us hear what we've been missing for the past thirty years. At the start of his career, Hayes wrote hit songs for the Stax/Volt label. That by itself is enough to label him as one of the planet's coolest people, but this collection doesn't even bother with his career as a songwriter for others. Instead, it picks up at the point that Hayes decided to become a solo performer on his own, and the diversity of his career is nothing less than mind-boggling. With no sign of strain, he seamlessly incorporated stone cold experimental jams, psychedelia, orchestral soul and funk, inspirational music, jazz reminiscent of the Ramsey Lewis school, and `love-man' R&B.    ""Hot Buttered Soul"" was the kick-off for a career that eventually came to define mid-seventies soul music, and it still stands as an all-time classic. It is amply represented here by standout extended jams like ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" and ""Walk On By"". It also moves through eleven subsequent albums, with mixed results that are nonetheless continually fascinating. At times, he sounds like a spitting image for Barry White, but with an unconventional flair for going further than any other funk soul brother would risk. Photos show Hayes wearing clothing that would make the king of the pimps jealous (head to toe in fur, or head to toe in leopard skin...you get the idea), while being referred to as `Black Moses'. It was a singular, unforgettable image that suits every track on this disk.  As a visual aid, Disk One represents the sound of mink pants and an open-chested shirt while cruising in a gold-tinged Cadillac with pink naugahyde interior. ""The Theme from Shaft,"" ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", ""Hyperbolicsyllabic-Sesquedalymistic"" and ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" all capture Hayes at his glorious, over-the-top peak. Disk two, meanwhile, is the aural equivalent of carelessly discarded chain mail, crushed velvet sofas, red light bulbs, and a bottle of Mateus Rose. ""Walk On By,"" ""If Loving You Is Wrong"", ""Baby I'm-A Want You"" and ""Let's Stay Together"" all stress the love-man vibe like burning incense. Far from consistent, though, there are a few mis-steps. Like everything else here, though, even the clunkers are spectacular in their badness. ""Three Tough Guys"" and ""Come Live with Me"" are both trite, incredibly overwrought, and poorly written - clunkers of astounding proportions, and all the more fascinating for it. The videos on the DVD disk are fabulous, though, both musically and historically, featuring three great songs/visuals from the often out-of-print film ""Wattstax"", plus the incredibly funny and ridiculous ""Chocolate Salty Balls"" video, from the `South Park' cartoon.

I was familiar with Karl Bhm's Die Walkre from Bayreuth and liked it and saw this vinyl set with stickers of awards it had received in Europe and I bought it.  Such trust!  Well, it paid off.  50 years later it is still at the top of my Mozart Requiem pile, albeit superseded lately by Christian Thielemans's splendid recording from Munich.  What I have loved about Bhm's recording of this masterpiece is his serenity, yes, serenity... Karl Bhm!  He has an unjustified reputation of being quick, heartless and dry in his recordings, stemming by and large from his fleet-footed and invigorating traversal of The Ring cycle at Bayreuth, a famous recording, still one of the top two in my estimation, along with Solti's, and his Tristan und Isolde from the same source.  His Mozart Requiem is rather slower than most and of a deep devotion rarely encountered in this piece.  It's the darkest, most solemn and perhaps most moving of them all.  The opening is deeply mournful and touching, not simply poignant and lovely, though it is those things as well.  The balance of the performance travels along those lines, never approaching the glibness of Rossini's Stabat Mater, which it often has in other conductor's hands, or the simply pretty and shallow.  Mozart was sad when he composed this piece.  Somehow I think he sensed his end being near and his usual bonhomie and roistering ways had come to a screeching halt in the face of ... Eternity.  Bhm has the great advantage as well with a quartet of the finest soloists possible for that day.  Edith Mathis, Julia Hamari, Wielsaw Ochman and Karl Ridderbusch.  Other recordings boast fine soloists as well, notably Peter Schreier's on Philips, with Margaret Price, Trudeliese Schmidt, Francisco Araiza and Theo Adam, perhaps the best all round team.  But Bhm's deeply probing yet subtle approach to this work is unique.  There is none of Karajan's grand-standing or Bernstein's melodramatics here, both fine recordings (all THREE of Karajan's actually).  The Requiem is one of those pieces that should be represented by multiple recordings in any serious library.  This is one of them, along with Thielemann and one of Karajan's and probably several others depending upon individual taste.

2304,551203,A3RUTBWPGVAR78,B0000DZDYN,Mary B. Daraz,False,"Heading the ska boom in the middle 90's was risky. Releasing an album about nearing your 30s was risky. Following 10 years of ska with a reggae pop album was almost ridiculous. No Doubt has done it all, and found phenomenal critical and commercial success at every turn. This, a simply extraordinary greatest hits package (which spans from 1992 to 2003) proves No Doubt has released some of the most important musical revelations on the radio in the past 11 years. ""Tragic Kingdom"" was the album that started it all. A brash combination of show tunes, ska, rock, and pop, it spawned several smash singles, all of which are covered here. ""Just a Girl"" shines in all of its new wave glory and funky guitar riffs. ""Sunday Morning"" and ""Spiderwebs"" are pure bliss, with soaring vocals and crunching melodies. ""Don't Speak"" is still the glistening breakup anthem it always has been, melancholy, moving, and totally amazing. Their second mainstream album, ""Return of Saturn,"" is responsible for some of the best tracks on here: the melancholy, effective ""Simple Kind of Life"" (in all of its folk/punk glory), and the different ""Ex-Girlfriend"" with its addictive loop beat. Their best hit, however, has to be ""Bathwater."" A vibrant hodgepodge of jazz, rock, ska, show tunes, and cabaret, it's eclectic sound is by far the most vibrant on the CD and it's sardonically fun delivery comes from frontwoman Gwen Stefani's powerful pipes with resonance and clarity. ""Rock Steady,"" the band's foray into reggae pop, provides some of the weaker moments here, what with the bland and annoying ""Underneath It All."" However, the fun and bouncy ""Hey Baby"" and the gorgeous ballad ""Running"" are good more than enough to compensate for its missteps. A glorious return to the pop airwaves comes with their perfect cover of Talk Talk's 80's hit ""It's My Life""--techno-synth sounds wash over drums and electric guitars with the classic 80's horn soundtrack. The ground No Doubt manages to cover in a mere 15 tracks is mind-boggling. They do it all with cohesive charm, every track blending together in a seamless stream of enjoyment. It's difficult to compare No Doubt to anyone, as they are the quintessentially cool crossover band. Perhaps influences by Blondie (evident from some of the rockier cuts off of ""Rock Steady) is worth mention, but they emerge with a style all their own. This is truly a collection that should not be missed-in fact; none of their albums should slide underneath your radar.

2316,450504,A5HMT6ZOBUAVM,B00005LANG,Amazon Customer,False,"What motivated Bob Marley to write some of his best lyrics, with strong spiritual content, messages of biblical condemnation for the wicked and biting criticism of the system and it's defenders? A complete album, some of his best work ever, and in contrast to earlier albums where there were always a few redone songs from his ska and rocksteady days, Exodus was mostly all new songs. Here you have an excellent mix - strong roots reggae rhythms on 'Natural Mystic' a Rasta grounation chant 'Heathen', a lighter dance tune 'Jammin', melodies such as 'One Love' and 'Three Little Birds' and two tracks that show Bob could have sung R&B, soul, love songs namely 'Waiting in Vain' and 'Turn your lights down low'. The title track was unique. Never before had there been a reggae song sounding like it, (funky world beat) nor had a reggae song ever been so long - over 7 minutes, most were short, to the point 3-4 minute jobs. The album built on what had been achieved with the previous album - penetration of the US market, but significantly here 'Exodus' was the first Wailer tune to get extensive airplay on African-American radio. What was the creative force behind all of this? We know that ganja and scripture reading was the fuel for some of Bob's words of wisdom but this album (specifically the first 4 tracks) were forged in direct response to one specific incident that happened to him in late 1976. Bob, Rita and the bands manager were at Bob's yard two nights before the 'Smile Jamaica' concert scheduled for December 5. The concert, featuring the Wailers, was to be held at the National Heroes Park in Kingston. It was conceived by Bob himself as a means of getting peoples minds off politics, which was the all consuming force in the Island at that time, with a general election coming up on December 16. Gunmen burst into the Marley house firing shots, all three were hit, Bob's manager five times, a shot grazed Bob's chest and hit his arm and Rita had one graze her skull. Who did it and for what reason was never known as the gunmen were not identified nor caught. Politics was suspected. Although the Wailers were not supporters of party politics they could hardly be called apolitical as their criticisms of the system, inequality, injustices and oppression had always been central to their message. It's just that it was the strongest in the previous album. If that is what it was all about, rather than be subdued, Bob was stirred up and 'Exodus' was his creative response fueled by righteous rastafari anger. Bob himself says so in a line from 'Jammin' - 'No bullet can stop us now'.

The narrative goes on to a bittersweet conclusion when she realizes that, because of their cultural differences, she can not stay with the doctor and does return to Ireland. This story was probably a little too serious for Broadway at that time. There were book problems before it opened when Pearl S. Buck's writing was mostly hurridly replaced to make the opening date. However, whatever the book problems, the score by Academy Award winning Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster is excellent. Listening to the recording with delightful songs and the incomparable Maureen O'Hara, you wonder how the show could have failed. It is not a great score, but certainly enjoyable. Could it be a case that the score and Miss O'Hara were the best things about the show? It is wonderful to have this overlooked score now available on CD for the first time.

2327,481154,AAQ75C4BJUQLO,B0000634G4,Sixto Limiac,False,"This is what I'm talking about!  Music that has been driven into a new generation of fitting, cunning, heartfelt power.  Guess what Taking Back Sunday is, a whirlwind of emotions.  More importantly, there album is an absolute masterpiece within the genre of Emo-Punk. Over the years, Metal and Hardcore Punk bands have greatly appealed to me, but as Boy Sets Fire drives an almighty wave of forceful lyrics and emotions, to include talented roars and scream-fests, I was simply compelled to what Emo-Punk has to offer (the darker side, mind you).  Consequentially, I discovered an extremely engaging band that warrants everything there is in the music industry, and much, much more.  They are a major talent which is utterly irresistible.    The opening track slowly reveals what's in store as you will find out it is a soon-to-be audible experience.  ""You Know How I Do,"" perfectly accommodates the hint of the A+ track list.  Instances of the two billowy singers breaking forth a hurricane.  Together, they collectively craft an ultimate product of Emo music that must - no - WILL  have a fan of the genre listen to such a stir.    The second track goes on a ranting, where the guitars take a drop alongside with the drumming and a female voice fills in the background.  Slowly, the frontman cries,""I'm miserable,"" the angelic voices fades back in,  ""I'm miserable. . ."" the frontman bumrushes into the track with, ""you got me right (holds it) where you want me!""  The collectiveness of it all is a stunning welcome.    It wasn't until the third track, ""Cute Without the E,"" did I realize that this album's potential sky-rocketed.  Here, both singers came out with a foundation of energy and feelings.  As their voices crossed each other, it seemed as if there were battling it out, where one singer went on as the other shrieked his heart out.  This is probably an Emo-Punk grit unlike anything I've heard before.  You can literally communicate with their passion.  Knowingly, I could tell that this was going to be one of those albums, you covet and would be delighted to play over and over until you got sick and tired of it.  Where and then after, the loss of it, you would be induced to throw it back in your stereo and repeat the beloved cycle.    In the sense, I could be a rambling fool if I were to go on, instead I'll give closure to this highly remarkable CD.  The single drawback I can afford to say about it is nothing.  I have no quibble over Taking Back Sunday's ""Tell All Your Friends,"" none whatsoever.  ""Tell All Your Friends,"" crawls within you, getting you in the mood of remorse, anger, or sorrowfulness, and it just cranks up the passion their music inspires.  I believe Emo-Punk truly takes its name by the heart of emotion demonstrated within its songs, and Taking Back Sunday achieves everything expected and surpasses the masses.  It is worth the introduction to your friends, and lives up to be one of the best albums I've ever picked up in my lifetime.",5,"07 22, 2003",Llives up to be one of the best albums Ive ever picked up,1058832000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,"know give second track talented lyric mood power female go much i'll importantly find i've realize none genre sunday utterly extremely fire feeling quibble emo-punk come ever sunday's foundation emotion drive heartfelt drum drawback rant consequentially hardcore knowingly simply could songs heard almighty take product guess emotion roar bumrushes listen cute angelic irresistible passion sick nothing name within open engage crossed generation take voice tire hurricane absolute ramble third induced sky-rocketed must go music singer seem unlike compelled friend beloved loss set stereo audible one play break offer new battling fill back warrant discover tell instance slowly accommodates right hint sense go believe afford single mass perfectly stun probably grit worth together truly scream-fests talk album's energy list fool major singer want remorse band highly mind frontman album billowy get heart metal what's would background sorrowfulness hold lifetime wave everything stir delight crank cd fan inspire potential guitar literally whirlwind voice welcome darker forceful include band forth shriek masterpiece year drop talent closure cries,""i'm side experience miserable pick album collectiveness surpasses collectively i'm life appeal anger best two drive soon-to-be cycle instead without whatsoever emo punk fade take communicate demonstrate reveals boy covet introduction greatly craft alongside fit repeat go remarkable ultimate expect say get industry throw crawl achieves anything store cunning"

The main 14 track set starts off with the infectious adult dance track and single, `Too Times Blue', with the somewhat sappy `If I Had You' two tracks later. These are the most ""mainstream"" moments on the record, with the latter sounding uncomfortably like something you might expect someone like Avril Levigne to record. Track four, `Deep End', is the undisputed show stopper of the album, replete with water metaphors. With its hard new wave musical and vocal overtones and sweet chorus, it delves into the courage of going with new love and banishing the fear of being wounded.  Other major highlights include the equally new-wave influenced title track with its sassy spoken-word verses and wry chorus, the avante-garde funk of `Love With A Vengeance', and the screeching art bar repetition of `You're Too Hot'. The addictive Lower East Side dance duet (with Miss Guy from the Toilet Boys) of `Charm Alarm' is also excellent, as is the soft and beautiful `What is Love' and the ice cool threat of `Heat of the Moment'.  Lower points - because there is nothing ""bad"" here - are `Dirty and Deep', which sounds like Harry trying to re-capture Prince's risqu early 80s period (do we really want to hear this woman sing the line, ""Lick it like you love it""?) and the overly sentimental `Needless to Say'.  The three additional tracks are all good, but do not sound like they are from the rest of the collection.  Harry's voice is strong, a little jazz-infused, and huskier than the silvery timbre she had back in the days of `Def, Dumb and Blonde'. On `Necessary Evil', it is evident that she accepts her age, embraces her eras and knows well the genres she has worked in. They are all represented here and she never attempts to sound young or relevant, which simply serves to elevate this album and transcend modern pop trends. She has said that this is simply a collection of things she had written, with no particular direction in mind, but that never detracts from the quality of the song-writing or the performances in these recordings.

Unencumbered by theatrics and stripped of orchestras, The Doors get down to the basics of blues-based rock and roll. They even successfully dabble with jazz elements, especially evident on the scary omniscience of ""The Spy"".  Jim Morrison's lyrical imagery has never been so potent. It fuses wonderfully into the band's most affecting music of their career that even ""You Make Me Real"" works as a good throwaway blues. There are autobiographical tinges (e.g.""Peace Frog""), the metaphysical (""Waiting For The Sun"") and keen social observation (""Ship Of Fools""). There's Sinatra-laced tenderness on the straightforward ballad ""Blue Sunday"".  Morrison's shot voice, hence organic, lends real power to their two greatest tracks ever, ""Roadhouse Blues"" and ""Land Ho!"". Both these blues rockers make references to the bottle. His vocals are full-bodied and emotive. ""Roadhouse Blues"" is bar-band blues played at its most authentic.

The selection there of African music was dauntingly huge. Even though Dussman's allows you to listen peacefully to any CD in the store, I couldn't imagine how to 'catch up' with the musical creativity of a whole continent. So I bought this sampler, which I could have easily found in a coffee shop in the States. Ah! The impatience of youth!  It's a wonderful selection. Of the twelve artists represented, I took a fancy to more than half. Then I came straight here, to the banks of the amazon, to search for the chosen favorites. Wonder of wonders, I found at least one CD from each of them. Though one of those was unavailable, the rest all featured samples. A couple, most prominently Angelique Kidjo from Benin, had multiple CDs, rave reviews, high sales ranks, and imposing lists of jazz and pop collaborators. On the down side, a couple of my choices had been misrepresented; the track on ""Acoustic Africa"" turned out to be atypical of their music, more authentically African and expressive than the bulk of their material.  But there were Aha! moments. The most exciting, to my ears, is Rajery (track 3) from Madagascar, who plays a tubular bamboo harp with strings made of bicycle brake cables, called a ""valiha"". He, or someone in his band, also sings. The lyrics are not included in this Putumayo sampler. I've ordered two of Rajery's CDs. I assume I'll have more to report after they arrive.  Also appealing, to me, were Vusi Mahlasela from South Africa; Habib Koite from Mali; Dobet Gnahore from Cote d'Ivoire; Gabriela Mendes from Cabo Verde; and Laye Sow from Mauritania, the only one whose broader work isn't available just now.

But the music is varied and entertaining, certainly swinging and joyful.  The situation at the beginning of the 20th century in New York, the state as well as the city is rather simple with a lot of social clichs: the immigrant who will succeed by pure chance added to some hard work; the bourgeois type upper middle class racially tolerant wife; the real ragtime musician and his loved one; the anarchistic working class militant calling for a revolution; The ship full of Jewish immigrants that nearly sank in view of Ellis Island; and I should say etc.  The main events are the vicious killing of the musician's girlfriend by some gang of firemen who will also destroy the musician's Model T out of spite because the man is black. Then the social and psychological derangement that this racist fact causes in the musician is by far too much since he starts a gang of bomb terrorists who start bombing all kinds of buildings to get even with society, to get a vengeance. The son of the rich family whose fortune was made in firecrackers decides out of spite mostly to join the musician and his gang and help him make better bombs. That is slightly childish.  The negotiations to stop this rampage are performed with the worst forked tongue you can imagine and the musician who is guaranteed justice in court and who has gained a safe exit for the members of his gang, comes out and is shot down at once by all the police waiting for him. That too is too much.  The end becomes then sentimentalese.  That kind of discourse on race relations and what it used to be and is no longer is rather easy but was typical of the 1990s. It is when racial discrimination was at the highest in justice and prisons that we had so many of these entertaining musicals or film to try to make us believe everything was going dandy and fine. It is evident that we are far from that nice situation and discourse.

2351,689892,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B000NQR7NO,Jonathan Oyama,False,"I thought it would be hard to follow up the fastest, fiercest and most enjoyable punk rock album, but the Arctic Monkeys' sophomore album is a great expansion of their ferocious sound.  In the Arctic Monkeys' first album, ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,"" they set the British punk scene on fire with a speedy flurry of virtuoso guitar riffs and drum beating. The second album, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare,"" continues their virtuoso performances, but with a more streamlined expansion of their surf-guitar sound.  The first single, ""Brianstorm,"" demonstrates that sound with a killer opening riff that resembles that opening to the film ""Pulp Fiction."" I love Jamie Cook and Alex Turner's killer staccato guitar blasts accompanying Matt Helder's fast-tempo drum beat. And unlike the singer in Bloc Party (no offense, mate), Turner has a taste for blood, blurting out, ""Brian, top marks for not trying/So I'd like you to bless us with your effortlessness/we'd wait for and so trained and comforted."" Obviously Turner hates working for the man.  And the Arctic Monkeys also hate the mindless drift into commercialism these days. Alex Turner is very blunt in his criticism in the smashing song ""This House is a Circus,"" singing ""This house is a circus/berserk as f***/We tend to see that as a perk though/look what it's done to your friends/their memories are pretend."" The Arctic Monkeys appropriately switch to a deep echoing guitar to add creepy Halloween sounds. Of course, sooner or later the Monkeys switch to smashing the haunting mood with crashing cymbals and loud guitars.  Overall, this album is more a concept album that criticizes social oppression. But ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" is a great concept album, where the Arctic Monkeys literally smash the hell out of punk with unconventional dissonant guitar blasts and spooky echoing riffs.

Even more so than the Boys' dalliance with Dusty Springfield (""What Have I Done To Deserve This,"" ""Nothing Has Been Proved,"" etc.), this collaboration  is dance drama fit for a queen.

I could have returned it to the club, but decided to keep it because of the connections between ""Des Knaben Wunderhorn"" and Mahler's astonishing second symphony which I have loved for many years. It turned out to be a lucky accident. These are flawless songs, perfectly exhibiting the craft of the second-greatest orchestrator in history. This new recording combines the talents of two of the greatest living lieder-singers with one of the few truly world-class teamings of orchestra and conductor. The sound quality is outstanding even by the best modern digital standards. In historic terms also, this is a significant milestone. To my ears, certainly, no one is ever likely to match Fischer-Dieskau's iron-fist-in-a-velvet-glove combination of power and smoothness, or his dramatic flexibility. However, Quasthoff's own experience of triumph over adversity does seem to give his reading a special value in these lyrics that are so trifling on the surface and yet have such profound depths of insight into the human soul. Von Otter in the songs for female voice gives what is perhaps the new definitive performance.

My initial reaction was ""is this how the rest of the album going to sound like?"". Thankfully it was not. The ethereal vocals of Monica Richards reminds me of some of the vocalists heard on the new Delerium cd ""Chimera"", and even a bit of kaRIN from the goth band Collide. Monica has a beautiful voice. It is really difficult for me to describe the music I have heard on ""Burning Season"". I guess a harder edge version of Black Tape For a Blue Girl would be the best descript for this cd. I especially loved the title track ""The Burning Season"". ""Whispered In Your Ear"" has a jazzy feel to the song, very slow and sensual. Monica's vocals are absolutely breathtaking on this song.

They're are some good songs to be found here, ""Can't Stay The Same"" definitely has a STD feel to it as does ""Radio"". But there are a few strange songs on here too, such as ""Turning Over In My Tomb"" and ""Bye Bye Baby"". My overall reaction to this album was ""It's Okay, But could have been better."" It does come with an over an hour long DVD too, which is cool. The bottom line is, if your already a fan of this band, by all means pick this up.

I wanted to love this album so badly.  Heck, I wanted to LIKE this album.  But it just didn't 'make' it.  The songs are poorly structured.  No one doubts their musical abilities and those abilities are showcased yet again.  But DT needs to go back and listen to some albums that got it 'right', like Leftoverture from Kansas or even their own Images and Words.

I am WAY disappointed in this album.  Go back and listen to Images and Words or even Awake and then come back to this one.  I think fans will see what I'm talking about.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think DT needs to repeat themselves over and over.  But at least give us something to sink our teeth into and not just riff for the sake of riffing.

2386,753350,A1G4NKH59E1OGF,B00104WHLA,veryvery,True,"I suppose the negative reviews complaining about compression and loss of dynamics are based on the CDs (side note: I wish reviewers indicated better what version they're basing their opinions on). Personally, I have not bothered listening to the CDs, opting for the 5.1 surround sound versions of these fantastic albums. and I don't hear any significant compression artifacts. The surround sound mixes have made gorgeous music even better! If you have a surround sound system and are a Genesis fan, you may safely purchase these. Especially if you, like me, enjoyed the two box sets released earlier; I think the surround sound makes a bigger difference on the earlier than on the later albums.  As with the previous box sets (1976-1982 and 1983-1998), the surround mixes often allow you to hear numerous things you never heard before. For instance, I can now clearly hear *both* acoustic guitars during the verses of ""The Lamia"" (my all-time favorite Genesis song), whereas earlier I could only hear one.  That said, occasionally there are things ""missing"" in these mixes. A few examples: the flute during the fadeout of ""The Lamia"" is now inaudible. The nasty ""tearing"" or ""ripping"" sound when Raels penis is cut off in ""The Colony of Slipperman"" is missing (and I've always thought of this sound as integral to the story!). During part of the keyboard section of ""Riding the Scree"" (the section that would later resurface in live versions of ""The Cinema Show""; i.e., the section that follows ""here I go...""), what used to be the primary melody has been pushed in the background, in favor of what used to be the accompanying melody, giving the illusion of a different melody altogether. Finally, there are moments throughout this box set when the bass guitar is too far in the background for my taste (this also goes for the 1976-1982 and 1983-1998 box sets). Overall, these are relatively minor complaints, and I think Nick Davis and Genesis have made spectacular surround sound versions of their music, and I'm very, very grateful to them!  Now, let's hope for a box set with the live albums! Genesis Live, Seconds Out, Three Sides Live, The Way We Walk, and the stuff in the Archive box sets (including the entire Lamb!) would all sound fantastic in 5.1.  As an aside, the interviews are quite fun. They're much longer than the ones included in the previous box sets (which were about 15 minutes each, while this time around they are about 45 minutes each). We get to hear from all band members, including Ant Philips. My favorite moment is when Phil Collins talks fondly about ""The Waiting Room"" ...

2388,652594,A3V3RJ1KI2Y1XS,B000FA57RQ,Brandt Raphael,False,"I'm not your typical Madonna fan. This means I won't spend two days before the concert to be in the front row. But I am a follower, from a distance, yes, but still a follower. I've been watching her for 20 years now.  I went to see the concert showed in this DVD, in Anhern (Netherland). The last time I saw a Madonna concert was in Buenos Aires (Argentina). It was her ""girlie show"", and the time 1993.  More than ten years later, the show is less about being a circus, less about just having fun, about trying to shock us with sex and mainly showing everything off. This time, it's about big, very big screens and a tiny Madonna, just in front of `em. That, with some dancers moving all over her.  She was so tiny in front of those huge screens.  How could she manage to keep up with the myth, she herself created?  How could she give this direction or this message she speaks of to 80'000 persons?  To me, on a unique personal level, she failed.  This DVD gives you the reasons why. Trying to be spiritual using the Madonna machine : no one can do that. She should have tried it differently. Or not. ""Let it will be"" is one of her new dance songs. She goes back to what her ""cage"", as she says herself, allows her to do: entertain people, not make them think. Yep! That's a lot and pretty much, it.  I read a comment about the last part of the DVD, her trip to Israel. Well, when it comes to the part when the show is about to be over, I though I would go depressed for a week just like when I finished to see ""truth or dare"". But no, not this time. This last segment took this awful taste out of my mouth, that a nostalgic ends always gives; and instead brought me hope, it gives a beginning, not an end. And that's a good thing.  ""Truth or dare"" was about being God. It was raw, unconscious, power.  ""I'm gonna tell you a secret"" is about how small we are. It's about a person who though was God and discovered her true small human nature and learned, just passing by, some humility. Does that make us dream? Probably not. Can or should a Popstar be like this? Neither. Is this healthier, well damn' yeah!  It is true that Madonna.com said it would be a tour ""for the fans"" and that she would sing all those songs she said she'd never, again, sing, those songs like ""material girl"", for example, or ""crazy for you"", sang virtually over the fans, or better, ""burning up"" (the greatest moment, with ""nobody knows me"", from the show. I just BURNED!).  All of this is absent from the DVD. Actually, the ""entertainment part"", is cut out, left I don't know where. And it's obvious why.  So, don't expect a good review of the show (it isn't her best anyway so you won't miss it! Just kidding!). It isn't.  It's more about what she's now. About what she cares for. And in that matter, she delivers.  After all this years, Madonna is still the most intriguing performer this planet carries on. I can't wait to keep watching, learning, doing.  PS: sorry Lourdes, ""I'm gonna tell you a secret"" it's not: ""je vais te dire un secret"", but "" je vais te raconter un secret"".

Besides the great singing from Sleepy Brown, the beat soaked in my head.  It was produced by J. Wells, who I didn't know who he was at the time.  That same year he produced Planet Asia's ""It's All Big."" He's produced tracks before that time, but his name and beats began to grab my attention.  So I pick up his Digital Master CD, and after a couple of listens, I felt he had potential to go a long way in the rap game.  Plus he's been mentored by J-Ro, Battlecat and DJ Quik.  He's close with west coast veteran Kurupt and legendary group, Goodie Mob. Now 2007 is here, and Digial Smoke has dropped.  I highly anticipated this CD when I heard it was coming out, and I am not disappointed.  J. Wells does a good job behind the boards because he has that true west coast sound especially tracks such as ""I Came Tru The Door,"" ""All We Smoke"" and ""Summertime.""  Kurupt does his thing also with his typical gangsta lyrics.  J. Wells spits also, but he's not the best, but not the worse.

The only gripe this author has is the quick cut at the ends of songs instead of a slow 'fade-out'.  It can be jarring.  However, it is not so bad that some of the originally longer songs have been shortened.  Only hard-core fans will notice the edits (i.e. ""Echoes"").

2433,1338639,A2Y4JBW5IKAR05,B000VEBGEY,Jon Chambers,False,"There isn't a huge repertoire for the enigmatic viola d'amore and, when you consider the instrument's eccentricities, it is hardly surprising. By the late seventeenth century (ie by Vivaldi's time) it had six sympathetic strings, mounted under the fingerboard, responding to another set of six principal strings above the fingerboard. But Vivaldi, for one, was sufficiently intrigued by its possibilities to write six concerti exclusively for the viola d'amore - whose name alludes to its association with the mysterious, nocturnal and sensual.  In Fabio Biondi's new recording, the concerti come to life. His playing is energetic and engaging and, whilst Vivaldi's writing isn't uniformly inspired across the set of six, Biondi's enthusiasm and technical skill provide enough interest to reward the listener.  One of the problems faced by a collection like this is the inherent lack of variety in a series of concerti all six of which share the same fast-slow-fast structure and three of which are in the same key of D minor. All six are written in either D or A, and one of the two 'bonus' pieces, the marvellous Concerto for viola d'amore and lute (RV540) is again in D minor. Biondi manages to pull it off, and not just because of his own manner of playing - he varies pace in a thoughtful, occasionally provocative way. The disc also includes a particularly rustic-sounding chamber concerto (RV97) in which the mood is more bucolic than sensual. Pairs of horns and oboes, a bassoon and a lute introduce novel colours while the fast-slow-fast structure is discarded in favour of a slow introduction. It is a superb chamber concerto that is entirely new to me, and provides one of the real high points of the CD.  This is the third recording I've heard of these pieces - the others are by Calabrese (1993, Erato) and Lazsio Barsony (1980, Brilliant). Biondi's is by far the best, thanks mainly to the infusion of variety in the mix. The informative booklet, meanwhile, adds further to the mystique of the instrument with illustrations of Biondi's viola d'amore (attributed to the Milanese maker Giovanni Grancino, c1700). The photographs show an instrument with distinctly odd-looking sound holes and a blindfolded head substituting for the usual scroll.

I respect that you're a musician yourself, love bluegrass and play the banjo, but if you really did play this disc once and then throw it away, I hope you threw it in the direction of someone who could appreciate it.  Perhaps you're a bit too set in your ways and traditionalist to really dig this album, but in my view, it's great.  True, it doesn't sound a whole lot like earlier YMSB material.  It's a bit more commercial, or ""radio friendly"" (although these days, in today's radio wasteland it's hard to imagine many stations that would actually play it-- if only KPIG from the Santa Cruz area could be in every market!  But I degress...).  The point is that it sounds a bit more newgrass than bluegrass, more Railroad Earth than traditional Yonder.  But that's ok, I happen to like Railroad Earth.  And the fact that these guys are going in a different direction on this album doesn't mean that it isn't quality music.  In fact, it's pretty terrific stuff, extremely well played and anything but ""boring"".  The truth be told, Yonder Mountain String Band was never really a traditional bluegrass band to begin with.  If this album isn't for you, then that's ok.  But to dismiss it as boring and essentially worthless simply because it's not like their earlier music is selling it very short and does a real disservice to the music, the band, and to all of those who would really love this and now might not buy it based solely upon your negative review.  In short, if you love newgrass and/or good country-rock, this should be very high on your ""to buy"" list.  No, it's not bluegrass, as such.

2441,1223950,AFLAIV5URQSDV,B00004T0LL,R Diaz,False,"There was a time when breakbeat was all the rage, and the music- as close to rock as electronica would get- seemed a sure thing for mass acceptance.  Ah, the perils of courting the mainstream; the sound quickly junked song  structure exclusively for the appealing hooks and devolved into big beat.  Whoever that didn't turn off quickly fled for the frenetic stylings of  jungle. So what's an artist to do, with a genre largely held in disdain?  Adam Freeland has the answer, raising the flag for nu-school breaks, the  hottest hybrid of the past year or so. Take two parts breakbeat, add the  subterraneous basslines of drum and bass, a dash of electro for good  measure, and you have a sound that packs the groove without beating it over  your head. Which brings us to Tectonics, Adam Freeland's mix of thirteen  tracks by artists you've probably never heard of, that take you through the  variations of nu-school style in one thorough swoop. Opening with the moody  ""Chronologic"" and ""Tectonics,"" the electro-tastiness of the (literal) ""Pig  chase"" and slowly expanding to encompass old school techno with ""Impulse  Transmisson"" and the hip-hop nod of ""My Mind"" and ""Stich Up."" Winding you  down proper, he offers up the bobilicious (and too short) churning bass of  ""Freak Frequency"" and the bluesy wonder ""Deep South."" In fact, the only  disappointment in the set is the one artist you're likely to recognize,  BT's overproduced ""Hip Hop Phenomenon."" As an album it highlights the  scene and makes a complete journey through sound. More important, it's an  excellent mix demanding to be heard in its entirety.

2454,347358,A11NKZ57YSELZC,B00000DG19,Kim Fletcher,False,"The Rolling Stones, the ""Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World"", has always been the claim. When you look back over the last forty years, it is a pretty hard one to dispute. Starting off playing Blues covers of their American heroes to a faithful few in South London's Youth Clubs, to worldwide domination of both the album charts and, starting up and then ruling ground breaking huge money making Stadium Rock. Of course, along the way there have been various ups and downs that, if anybody had written down as a work of fiction, people would of claimed it to have been too preposterous to be anywhere near the truth. After a few cover songs to break them into the British charts (including the fabulous 'I wanna be your Man', written for them by ""The Beatles""), Jagger - Richards started writing hits of their own, which would in turn be covered by almost every band that followed in their footsteps. Hit albums followed with more hit singles; successful tours in all parts of the globe... Then it all went momentarily wrong. Original leader and guitarist Brian Jones left the band and then mysteriously drowned in his own swimming pool; drug busts and prison sentences (later squashed after famously being compared to using a rack to crush a butterfly in an open letter to ""The Times""); a failed Single; difficulty with confectionery; and the keyboard seat becoming about as welcome as the drum stool in Spinal Tap. The boys proved that, although they looked and acted as the proverbial dirty rockers, there was a fair amount of grey matter there too, so more hit singles were written, more international bestselling albums were released, and more than all their peers, The Stones kept on rolling.  As the years rolled past, each album was released to great expectations (some living up to those expectations - some not). Each world tour sold out faster than the last one and to bigger and bigger audiences. Guitarists arrived, two even left. Mick Jagger made terrible movies (I mean have you seen `Freejack'?) and he released even worse solo albums claiming he did not need the rest of the band, and then scampered back to the safety of the Stones when he realized he did.  He had more affairs with a string of glamorous and ever younger women than even Casanova was reported to have had. Keith and Ronnie Wood made some reasonable solo albums in their spare time, but not exactly groundbreaking, while Charlie Watts was always just Charlie. ""No Security"" is a collection of live songs from the 'Bridges of Babylon Tour'. A nice little memento if you caught the tour or a reminder of what you missed if you didn't. ""No Security"" is the seventh Stones live album and their second in three years at the time, so by its very notion it could not be a straight collection of songs recorded as in concert running order. You cannot just go banging out versions of 'Jumpin Jack Flash', 'Honky Tonk Woman', and 'Satisfaction' every time like a continues conveyer belt of Greatest Hits every time you go on tour, expecting your loyal fans to keep on forking out their hard earned bucks. On the other hand, when so much work has gone into a tour, why let the Bootleggers get all the money by releasing the live recording? So the Stones took a great attitude and released a collection of songs from the tour that were a little bit special. On ""No Security"" the Stones flex their collective musical muscle by opening up with the aptly named ""You Got Me Rocking"", which immediately has Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood grooving along on guitar with Keith delivering an awe inspiring solo. Next up is the finest version of ""Gimme Shelter"" this dog has ever heard, the whole band positively shimmers and when it gets to the call and response chorus of ""Just A Kiss away"", Mick Jagger and the wonderful Lisa Fischer taunt each other to the end. We then get a live version of probably the only good song from the terrible mid-seventies album ""Black 'n' Blue"" 'Memory Motel'. While a great version, I would still rather have Keith Richards singing his half of the duet rather than special guest Dave Matthews. I mean he does a fair version, but then he is no Keith Richards, but then who is? The next guest is truly phenomenal though as long time Stone inspiration Taj Mahal gets up to growl his way through a version of his ""Corinna"". This alone is worth the price of the album. The beautiful ballad ""Waiting on a Friend"" is an inspired run through with famous jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman taking the solo (Bobby Keys is the regular saxophonist for the Stones and gets his chance to shine on the final track, an extended version of ""Out Of Control""). Keith gets his turn in the vocal spotlight with his own ""Thief in the Night"". The audience gets a chance to sing their collective hearts out with Mick Jagger as the conductor on ""Saint of me"". ""Sister Morphine"" from the ""Sticky Fingers"" album is completely rearranged for this live outing, and the band reach back to 1965 for their third British number one (when it meant something to have a number one hit single). ""The Last Time"" they play with as much gusto as if they had written it last week. The version of ""Respectable"" from the ""Some Girls"" album leaves the studio version in tatters. ""Live With Me"", the only song here repeated from the proper first Rolling Stones live album ""Get Your Ya Ya's Out"". It shows the band has lost none of its thunderous ability or master hood of getting down and dirty with the best of them. Nobody plays as sleaze as these boys.

2463,217341,A1VWRH8ALP6VF2,B000002LEU,Tony Moore,False,"When a singer takes one's life right when things were beginning to erupt for both the singer and the band, there is sure to be alot of leftover tunes that will be compiled for an album to make lots of money off the free publicity.  What is surprising is when one of these 'unreleased material' albums have some of the band's biggest and greatest songs.  Throughout Substance you'll notice alot of more unpolished, punkish material compared to their two studio albums. Substance throws in their first album they recorded with the moniker Warsaw, and back then they were pretty much an above average punk band.  But the songs they put on here are something, ""Warsaw"" and ""Digital"" are rollicking songs that work mostly due to Ian Curtis's backpack full of charisma, kind of like Johnny Rotten and how he saved The Sex Pistols from being a middling punk band or should I saw almost saved.  Yeah, you can tell that their influenced by the Sex Pistols and all those other British punk bands.  But like I said, Ian Curtis's performance and Peter Hook's bass make these songs great on their own. Actually the weak points of the album come from the songs that are more similar to the stuff on their albums.  Songs like ""Autosuggestion"" drag because you can tell that the band hasn't yet perfected their song, and it's still a work in progress. However, the album has the two greatest Joy Division songs ever written, ""Atmosphere"" and ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" the insanely popular British song.  Other slip ups on the album include ""Novelty"" and ""Komakino"" probably because they are very similar to previous songs on the album except not as good.  It was a great idea to end the song with ""These Days"" which is both a great song and a perfect closer.

2464,607984,A1432KCCCZL550,B0009EOZYO,Metalhammer,False,"I give this album a reluctant 3 stars.  If it were a 1-10 scale it's probably get a 6, which would balance out to 3, but other albums I've given 3 I like much better, not all but several.  5 is really not enough for an accurate rating, but it's what I have to work with.  Dream Theater has been one of my favorite bands for a long time, and the band that introduced me to progressive music, then or Rush, which I liked first.  Either way, one of the first progressive rock/metal bands I've ever heard, first metal.  Their 90's stuff along with Six Degrees were all classics, but things started to shift after that.  This is the second in a long string of ok to bad albums by the band.  Now granted I've given passing grades to all of them, but still.  I've had issues with all of them.  Mostly this one it's the tone of the album.  It's a lot mellower, which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, but on here it doesn't really work.  There are only 3 rockers on here.  There are a few songs that are just plain boring.  We get 2 bad songs, which if they were removed I'd like the album much better.  Root Of All Evil 6/10 starts off quiet before becoming a rocker.  Kind of an upper mid tempo song.  The main riff is pretty good.  The problem is this song has no staying power.  I tend to forget it except for the intro, once it's done.  There's just no hook, nothing to keep me coming back.  James sounds good on here.  The song slows a bit after the first chorus.  Also we get parts of the previous songs from Portny's 12 step program in here.  I already know Glass Prison and Dying Soul thank you.  I really don't need to hear parts of them in another song.  I can listen to those songs just as easily.  This song after the first chorus kind of drifts into some sort of bridge that really doesn't go anywhere.  It's not terrible, but it leading to a reprise of the chorus from Dying Soul is too much for me.  If I could edit that out and still have the song sound good I'd do it.  The solo's decent  The Answer Lies Within 1/10 talk about a snooze fest.  This is a predominantly piano driven song with if memory serves me some horn playing where the guitar solo should be.  I don't remember if there is any guitaring in this song.  Now I know this song isn't my cup of tea, but did it have to be so boring?  Dream Theater alone has had some good to exceptional piano driven songs, Another Day, Disappear, Through Her Eyes, Space Di Vest one of my all time favorite songs actually, but come on..  They could have done better.  Honestly it's been years since i've heard this song, haven't listened to it since the album came out.  I gave it some time, but it never grew on me.  These Walls 9/10 kind of sounds a bit old school to me.  It's one of those soft verse, heavier chorus.  Love the melody in the chorus.  This is definitely a highlight for me.  There's a nice build up to the chorus too.  I Walk Beside You 2/10 cool intro riff, but that's about all the positive I can say about it.  Really I have no idea why I hate this song so much.  Sure it's cheesy and poppy.  Maybe that's it, but there are plenty of cheesy poppy songs I like.  It kind of has a U2 sound to it.  Mostly it's the chorus that bugs me.  Plus this is like the third ballad in a row, and only 1 was any good.  Fortunately that 1 is awesome, but still.  That doesn't help the fact this song kinda sucks.  On my computer/ipod I inserted Raise The Knife in this song's place, wish they'd just put that song on here instead.  Panic Attack 9/10 is the heaviest song on the album, and one of my favorites, not just because it's heavy, but because it's a good song.  The drums are almost frantic sounding.  There's a nice riff throughout the song.  James's vocals are awesome.  I like the melody during the chorus.  Jordan's playing actually compliments the song, which is the closest thing you'll get to me complimenting him, untill I get to Six Degrees or Scenes...  They definitely named the song perfectly to fit the music.  Actually this is probably one of their heaviest songs overall, thinking about it.  Never Enough 9/10 is another rocker.  This one the guitars are more subdued, muted notes, and we hear piano prevalent throughout the song.  It actually works ok on here.  Love the vocals again.  I know a lot of fans don't care for James's voice, but I think he does a good job.  Nice fast paced drumming.  I wish they'd separated this song from the previous one though, as the rest of the album, Root of all evil excluded are pretty much ballads.  Sacrificed Songs 7/10 uh another political song.  Well..  That was the trend at the time.  the piano part at the beginning was fairly boring.  There was just no emotion to it, and I didn't need the long drawn out news clipping vocal tracks to start the song.  They could have just gone straight into the song.  The song gets more interesting once everything else, guitars, drums etc, kick in, but still.  There's a lack of emotion to this song, that works against it, especially given what they're singing about.  Octavarium 5/10 is the epic of the album.  Honestly this is another I haven't heard in years.  Where I have trouble remembering Root of all evil, at least that song isn't this long, long enough, but still.  I just don't remember this song, so hence the middle of the road rating.  I figure I shouldn't give it a failing grade, because it's really not a terrible song.  I just never found it to be a song I wanted to hear either.  But, most fans seem to like this one above the others on here.  Overall if you're a Dream theater fan, you'll probably like this one.  Most people seem to.  Personally the style and production just made this one of the least enjoyable albums of their career.  Still there are gems to be had on here, so at least listen to it, and decide for yourself.  It's really not a bad album, just the slower parts, most anyways, come off a little emotionless.",3,"09 28, 2011",So that's how you spell Octavarium..

As engaging as Ray Of Light, Music continues to show Madonna's greater interest into deeper and more mature issues.  On the excellent next single What It Feels like A Girl, Madonna laments how the (male-dominated) world has treated women and imagine what it would have been for her if she were a man. On the vocodered Nobody's Perfect, Madonna sings about how no one can be perfect and she is vulnerable to making mistakes too. The concluding title Gone sees Madonna saying ""Selling out is not my thing."" How true!  For someone who has stayed resilient through the changing musical landscapes over the last 20 years, Madonna has kept herself at the forefront of music and fashion.

Piece Of My Heart sweeps the listener along in its maelstrom of sound, while Combination Of The Two has a certain addictive, hypnotic quality that is the trademark of great rock music. Summertime and Ball & Chain are innovative interpretations of the Gershwin and Big Mama Thornton tunes respectively, while of the added tracks, Magic of Love is the only one that matches the intensity of the original album's songs.

They scored big with Cooleyhighharmony, and II-well, I don't think I need to go into that. But the album hadn't even been out for a week before many listeners, including diehard Boyz II Men fans, accused them of starting to fall off. This might have started because although the first single ""4 Seasons Of Loneliness"" is good, it wasn't a big hit, while their other first singles (""Motownphilly"" and ""I'll Make Love To You"") were. What people need to understand is that some artists don't necessarily make songs just to get hits, although they don't mind getting hits. But when I listened to the album, something didn't seem to fit 100%. Oh, they did stay true to their formula at the beginning of the album in songs like ""Doin' Just Fine"" and ""Never"", but as the album went on it felt like they were slowly changing their style. This can best be expressed by the Sean Combs-produced ""Can't Let Her Go"", which isn't TERRIBLE, but it just doesn't sound like typical Boyz II Men. Actually, it's one of those songs that you'll be able to get into every other time you hear it. (They're better with fast songs that still have soul in them, like ""Thank You"" from II.) The singing in ""Baby C'mon"" will make you wonder if that's really them singing or if it's a bonus track from an upcoming artist, and ""Dear God"" would have been a better ending to II, not to THIS album. I don't know what Babyface was thinking when he wrote ""Girl In The Life Magazine"", because it sounds like something that came out of a ten-year-old boy's diary: ""I used to dream she would call/Crying her eyes out/She had an obsession with me/I was the love of her life/And she was all mine/The girl in the Life magazine."" Then they do their own rendition of New Edition's smash ""Can You Stand The Rain"". It isn't exactly bad, but that's a song that should never be remade. Many people call this album a commercial flop, primarily because it didn't sell as much as II. But when an album nearly goes diamond, it's hard to come back to that again.

2501,316494,A2H22I2RWE0HOV,B000006RHK,Mr. Sinister,False,"It's very hard to keep my head straight when it comes to 1984's Powerslave.  My first instinct is to say that it's another metal classic from Iron Maiden and then I digress....  Was Powerslave truly an awesome Iron Maiden album?  Of course many the Maiden fan is gonna say HELL YESSSSS!! but when breaking it down song by song as I will do, Powerslave comes up lacking.  Now, this is probably the very last Iron Maiden album that kept the cohession of a really good album alive as far as it went, but there is filler here and it's pretty obvious.  Where Piece Of Mind had six pretty killer tunes in a row, Powerslave is choppy.  There is killer and not-so-killer intermixed.  So, when you, the absolute die-hard Iron Maiden fan think back to Powerslave, instinct says to call it awesome, but further review says something else.  Let's look at the album song by song, for that is the only way an album should be judged, for it is ALL the pieces of the puzzle that make the picture complete, right?  Aces High -  Maiden always has pretty good opening songs and Aces High is no exception, but they tend to keep the better songs for second or third or later.  Aces High is a solid tune with the signature Maiden riffs and driving Harris bass line.  Not their best, but very far from their worst.  Average Maiden we'll call it.  Cool.  2 Minutes To Midnight - AWESOME SONG!!!!  One of my all-time top-ten favorite Maiden tunes, along with Running Free, Killers, Beast, Run To The Hills, The Trooper, etc....  The lyrics are brutal and I dig that.  Great, all-out effort.  Perfectly Maiden and perfectly metal!  We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.....  Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) - Uh... hmmmm.  A churning, pounding instrumental.  Is this Genghis Kahn?  Is this Transylvania?  Maiden hasn't done an instrumental since Killers and this isn't up to par with their earlier efforts.  Almost sounds like a Maiden tune that someone forgot to put lyrics to.  Middle of the road.  Have you ever heard anyone say that Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) was their favorite song? I sincerely hope not!  It's decent, that's all.  Flash Of The Blade - This song is an underrated rocker that gets overlooked mostly because the lyrics are a bit choppy.  The chorus is straight Maiden, but it lacks the necessary hooks that make a Maiden song great.  Duellists - Apparently the whole fencing thing that Maiden was into at the time was starting to appear in their songs.  This songs sounds very, very, very reminiscent of Where Eagles Dare.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Maiden is already starting to repeat themselves and that detracts from this song.  Also, the lyrics are garbled just a tad and Bruce is whiny.  Not a good combo.  Okay.  Not great.  Musically, it rocks fairly well, but it sounds like Maiden on cruise control.  Back In The Village - This song is very cool.  The opening riff is energetic and catchy.  The lyrics are good.  The biggest problem is that it's buried behind three filler tunes in a row and that makes it tarnished.  Once you lose the cohession of a good flowing album, the songs start to run together like melting wax and renders them unmemorable.  Back In The Village should have been closer to the front of the album to remain effective.  Powerslave - Egyptian themed title track buried in obscurity.  The album cover is very Egyptian in nature and Derek Riggs outdid himself in his detail.  Awesome.  But with the cover depicting the Egyptian Valley Of The Kings ala Eddie, where are the rest of the songs that keep that theme going?  There aren't any.  What Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)? Didn't think so.  It was expected when you bought the album that there would be a little bit more Egypt in its content.  Oops!  This song is pretty good, however, just should have been second or third or fourth, not second to last.  When it was on vinyl, it probably got overlooked quite a bit.  The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner - Sammuel Taylor Collerige's epic poem turned into and Iron Maiden song that clocks a litte over 13 1/2 minutes.  It took me more than a decade to like this song and now it's one of my favorites.  Shows us once again that although Maiden are metalheads, they're literate metalheads, and that is a good thing.  Awesome tune. Some fans will disagree, saying that it's too long, but f*ck 'em, it rips.  Overall, as you look back at Powerslave as I have just done, you can pick out the flaws quite easily.  There is filler here and there that brings it down to a great album instead of an AWESOME album.  Number Of The Beast and Killers were awesome!  Piece of Mind and Powerslave are great.  The cohession is there most of the way, but the filler shows and Maiden feels like they're going through the motions without much emotion on some of the middle songs.  I still rated Powerslave with five stars because it is probably the very last great Iron Maiden album (though many will disagree, thinking that Maiden continued to get better instead of worse) but that's a fight of opinions and I'm not here for that.  If I were trying Maiden for the first time I would pick The Number Of The Beast.  Simply because it's a much better, more honest effort.

2511,350736,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00000DQSS,Gary F. Taylor,False,"Although it clearly belongs to the same style as the previous THE KICK INSIDE and LIONHEART, NEVER FOR EVER marks a decided change in Kate Bush's direction; less whimsical and considerably more overtly macabre, on this particular recording Bush largely eschews both the purely playful and the warm love songs of previous recordings.  Her tone of voice is also fuller and considerably less girlish than on previous recordings.  The material here is also considerably more violent in terms of lyrics.  In her previous recordings Bush certainly showed a tendency toward images of impending or actual death (""James and the Cold Gun"" and ""Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake"" leap to mind), but in NEVER FOREVER she is less inclined to present such pieces as ""character pieces,"" less inclined to romanticize them with a gothic flavor.  And irony, never far beneath the surface in earlier work, is much more apparent.  Such tracks as ""Violin"" (concerning a neurotic/erotic obsession with the instrument, in which Bush's voice mimics the tone of the instrument), ""Wedding List,"" (in which a frustrated bride contemplates the slaughter of the whole wedding party), and ""Breathing"" (in which the singer is dying of radium poisoning following an atomic blast) are perhaps the logical extensions of Bush's earlier work; at the same time, with such tracks as ""All We Ever Look For"" and ""Army Dreamers,"" we begin to see a transition from material based on internal private fantasy into something much broader and considerably more subtle: deliberate commentary on the world around her.  This is particularly true of ""Army Dreamers,"" which is very clearly a percusor to her next album, THE DREAMING--which will be a radical departure from her earlier sound.  Even as she is toying with new dimensions in her lyrics and vocal interpretations, Bush is also toying with increasingly complex arrangements.  There is a sense of greater delicacy and greater deliberation in terms of pure music on this particular recording, again with ""Army Dreamers"" a case in point.  Fans of the earlier recordings will find enough similarity to them in NEVER FOR EVER to enjoy them as a continuation; fans of her later work, however, will see in it the build toward her two finest recordings, THE DREAMING and HOUNDS OF LOVE, both of which are as completely unlike her early works as can be imagined.

2514,483646,A2YX8AMUIPLA4F,B000063V8Y,DP,False,"This album is a solid, state of the art production with catchy pop hooks and keyboard laden arrangements.  This album was released in the heyday of MTV, in which the band from England received attention in the United States from regular video exposure, most notably for its high powered signature ballad, the title track to this fine album.  Written by Gary Kemp and equipped with the powerful and emotive vocals of Terry Hadley, this classic serves as one of the quintessental pop tunes that appears on numerous 1980's music compilations as well on innumerable movie soundtracks (It was recently featured in Adam Sandler's film ""The Wedding Singer,"" several years ago.)  In the early 1990's, the group PM Dawn sampled riffs from the song ""True"" for its debut single, ""Set Adrift On Memory Bliss,"" which topped the pop charts.  Even today, it still remains a timeless ballad, one of my favorite tracks of the 1980's. This album contains several other chart hits: ""Gold"" is a high fueled, relentless pop track espousing the importance of believing in oneself, trusting your inner knowingness, following your heart. ""Communication"" explodes as an upbeat opener on the cohesive collection that was a moderate hit for the band as well. ""Pleasure"" is a pop ditty in which a teenage soul is desperately  soul searching to open his heart to feeling and experiencing love.  ""Code Of Love"" is a song in which the group explores the intricasies of relationship.  ""Lifeline"" continues  on the theme of relationships and contains the lyric ""so live and let live in love"" delivered with a passionate sense of exploring all that life has to offer to the fullest.  This segues into the upbeat ""Heaven Is A Secret"" and the track ""Foundation,"" in which Hadley sings with urgency about the importance of laying a loving and truthful base to their relationship.""  The album consummately reaches a spiritual, uplifting climax with ""True."" The album linear notes is complete with lyrics to all 8 songs.  Although this set only clocks in at a mere 36 minutes, it serves a succinct and an imporatnt introduction to a fine pop band that unfortunately only experienced brief exposure in the US.

Also they had lost two members since 1982, Bassist David Hungate, and vocalist Bobby Kimball.  To Replace Hungate, Toto Hired another Porcaro brother, Mike Porcaro.  Replacing Bobby Kimball would be no easy feat.  They settled on Fergie Frederiksen.    From the beginning it's clear this is a different Toto.  They seem to have gone  the way of fast rockers.  Carmen is catchy enough, but Fergie's voice just can't cut it for me.  To high and squeaky.  The following song lion is good, but after that nothing else memorable happens.  No memorable tunes hooks or harmonies.  All the hallmarks of Toto are gone.  Now I commend them for trying something different, but it just does not work.  What we  get is a cold sterile album  which lacks the warmth and heart Toto has.  The one saving grace is How Does It Feel, A Steve Lukather ballad that reminds us what we're missing.  That's the other thing, There's ONE ballad here.  Toto can rock but they've always had ballads to balance it out.  Not here.  They even went country here with Holyanna, and I hate it.    Needless to say this album tanked and destroyed their U.S. fan base.  They knew Fergie was an experiment gone wrong because by the next album he's gone.

This is ""Amorphous Androgynous"", a side project of Cobain and Dougans that sounds entirely different. If you are expecting another FSOL album, you will be gravely disappointed.  Also, there seems to be at least 2 different versions of this album. The version I have is different, containing the following tracklist:  1. The Lovers  2. The Isness  3. The Mello Hippo Disco Show  4. Goodbye Sky (reprise)  5. Elysian Feels  6. Go Tell It To The Trees Egghead  7. Divinity  8. Guru Song  9. Osho  10. Her Tongue is Like a Jellyfish  11. Meadows  12. High Tide On the Sea of Flesh  13. The Galaxial Pharmaceutical  I can say that I have heard this version of ""The Isness"", and it isn't as good. ""Goodbye Sky"" is the only song you'll be missing out on if you don't get this version, and I think its part of the ""Isness & Otherness"" package anyway if you get that instead. Don't miss out on ""The Lovers"", which you will recognize from the ""Papua New Guinea Translations"" album by FSOL, but this is a much better version. The title track, ""The Isness"" is fairly decent as a slow, beatless kind of meditation too. It's a slight change, but those 2 are stronger than ""Yes My Brother"" and ""Goodbye Sky"".  Anyway, this is a really solid album if you look at it production wise. It's got great gentle grooves in it, awesome prog rock tunes like ""Divinity"" to balance things out, and some REALLY nutty tracks like ""Her Tongue is Like A Jellyfish"" to keep you wondering what is going on. Highlights are ""Go Tell it to the Trees Egghead"", an upbeat little jaunt that sounds like it was a jam session that blossomed into a song. The other is ""The Galaxial Pharmaceutical"", a huge prog rock tune (its 13 minutes long on my version, don't know about this one)that sounds like Jon Anderson wrote it. Also, ""Elysian Feels"" has a really neat vibe to it that's part sitar groove, part electronic madness, and part rock 'n roll. This is a solid album, from start to finish.

2539,94983,A2PTL3QI1NIYGS,B0000025LB,Michael G. King,False,"POINT OF ENTRY is to JUDAS PRIEST what CARESS OF STEEL is to RUSH. Overlooked, neglected, and absolutely MAGNIFICENT. GUITAR ROCK AT IT'S FINEST! I first purchased this recording on cassette tape in 1981, I was in my senior year of high school. At the time, I already owned the BRITISH STEEL (1980) and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (1978) cassettes (purchased in that order). By then, ""Living After Midnight"", from BRITISH STEEL, had received SO MUCH airplay that I never wanted to hear it again. Much was the same for the entire BRITISH STEEL cassette. My friends just absolutely played it into the ground. POINT OF ENTRY WAS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR! In fact, I think my friends were asleep when this was released, because I was the only person I knew listening to it. I'll say again, POINT OF ENTRY WAS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, JUDAS PRIEST STYLE! Positioned between BRITISH STEEL (1980) & SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE (1982), it lacked the commercial airplay appeal of those other releases, and therefore explains much of the neglect that has occurred. By the time SCREAMING... arrived on the scene, everyone was playing it into the ground too! My friends awoke! POINT OF ENTRY just sort of disappeared in the sunset. Such a SHAME! By now, HELL BENT... & POINT OF... were the PRIEST tapes I was listening to regularly. Quite in contrast to my friends. The lack of commercial airplay appeal is the one thing that makes this a better recording than either ...STEEL or SCREAMING... The only track on POINT OF ENTRY that received any airplay at all was ""Heading Out To The Highway"", and it holds up much better than ""Living After Midnight"" when it comes to sounding dated. HEADING OUT TO THE HIGHWAY is to JUDAS PRIEST what RUNNING ON EMPTY (the song) is to JACKSON BROWNE. And yes I know the looks I must be getting, mentioning Jackson Browne in a Judas Priest review. RUSH OK, but Jackson Browne? Just goes to show I like all kinds of music. THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE A GUITAR DRIVEN TOUR DE FORCE. The songs ""Don't Go"", ""Turning Circles"", & ""Desert Plains"" are PHENOMENAL. The bonus track of ""Desert Plains"" (live) showcases the band's ability to get WILD in concert. A tight addition in my book. I saw Judas Priest on the DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH tour in 1984. On stage and in studio are definately two very different things for this band. Play the studio and bonus live tracks back-to-back just for the fun of it. If you are a Judas Priest fan and don't own this CD, you are missing the best part of Judas Priest. It had been a long time since the old cassettes wore out, and I have just today, 7/6/01, purchased the remastered POINT OF ENTRY & SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE CD's.

2541,644436,A2KER9VZZDSJQ7,B000EGDD7M,Ashley M. Blanchard,False,"The first time I heard MF Doom's voice was unique because I didn't quite know what to make of his garbled-dusty sound.  Listeners tend to be conditioned for beautiful singing voices and excitement, therefore; much of MF Dooms genius is missed on surface level.  When Doom does sing on ""Rainbows"", he will use his haze-infested vocals to glide over jazzy horns.  This may put off some but to me it's similar to ODB in that the singing voices are so bad that they are somewhat good in their own bizarre way.  An impressive characteristic about Doom is his sheer range of references as a base for his affinity with multi-syllabic cadences.  He will mention video games, cartoons, Star Trek episodes/characters, and left field pop culture figures by amalgamating them with a highly technical rhyme cadence.  For example, check his bars on ""Figaro"" (""do not stand still, boast show skills close but no crills/post for po' ills post no bills/coast to coast Joe Shmo flows real go chill/not suppose to overdose no doze pills/off pride tikes now talk wide through scar meat/off sides like how Worf rides with Star fleet"").  Brilliant.  And here lies a problem with some listeners.  The knock on Doom for ""Madvillain"" is that Dooms lyrics are sometimes jumbled together with no continuity of subject matter.  Thankfully, I see beyond the content because Doom remains technically sound on the whole album.  If Doom ends a bar with a three syllable word then  you can expect to find the last word(s) of the next bar to rhyme the same as that three syllable word in the preceded bar.  Listen to any Doom verse on ""Madvillain"" to get an idea for flawless rhythmic execution.  Many rappers will rhyme the last three syllable word with only one syllable at the end of the next bar which can make a rapper lazy and flawed in delivery.  The lyrics may seem undecipherable at times but when they sound so good then is anybody really going to be that hypocritical?  Doom also has the unique ability to stay fresh and relevant by creating countless aliases.  He will go from 'Zev Luv X' to 'Metal Face', to 'King Geedorah', to 'Victor Vaughn', to 'Danger Doom', to 'Metal Fingers', and more.  Artists who fail to reinvent themselves can become stale amongst fans who have heard it and seen it before.  This is why I call Doom a 'Master Transformer' because Doom has the ability to re-create himself to bring a new mystique and energy to his many personas.  More than likely, it's Dooms love for comic books that allows him to offer new creative perspectives (check the cartoonish comic strip video for ""All Caps"")!  He always has an interesting angle to play from denouncing smoke critics on ""America's Most Blunted"", dissing himself on ""Fancy Clown"", and making a pass at some honey dips on the clever ""Money Folder"".  On the flip side is Madlib who manages to show off an amazing collection of dusty jazz samples along with some off-kilter black and white movie flicks.  The song structure is as unconventional as you can get.  At twenty two tracks and under fifty minutes, most songs are in the two minute range with one to two verses and no choruses.  It's a slap in the face to formulaic  song structure which adds to the records effectiveness.  History shows that when a super producer hooks up with a super Emcee the results are usually disappointing.

2544,607824,AQS8FI2XQO2JK,B0009E32N4,MainePT,False,"First off, don't buy this if you're looking for the BS&T of ""Spinning Wheel"" reknown.  But DO buy this if you want to hear some great music, great playing, and great arrangements. After BS&T 4, the band and David Clayton-Thomas parted ways. Enter Jerry Fisher, the new lead singer. There had always been a couple of ""factions"" within the band, the ""Rockers"" (basically the rhythm section) and the ""Jazzers"" (the horn section). And with each of the previous 3 albums, there was always pressure to come up with tunes that would highlight Clayton-Thomas' vocals for the next ""hit"". Now with a new lead singer, as well as a new guitarist, keyboardist, and saxophonist, the band decides to make an album that THEY enjoy recording. And the ""Jazzers"" seemed to exert more control over this project, although one would still be hardpressed to call it a ""jazz album"".  Unfortunately for BS&T, the record-buying public wasn't ready to accept a BS&T without the Clayton-Thomas ""sound"". Jerry Fisher was certainly a fine vocalist and a lot easier to work with than Clayton-Thomas, but as you will hear, the band certainly took a different direction on ""New Blood"". More soloing (David Bargeron really gets to shine on 2 numbers, as well as he should!) and the new guitarist Georg Wadenius gets to stretch out on Hancock's ""Maiden Voyage"". But there are other numbers certainly designed for radio airplay for the masses, with compositions by Bob Dylan and Carole King among them.  The playing is first-rate on this album. But to try and compare THIS band with the band on ""Spinning Wheel"" would be the same as comparing any of it with the band on ""Child Is Father To The Man"". Lot of the ""core"" players are still there (Colomby, Katz, Fielder, etc) but with the newer players it stands to reason that musical sensibilities would change.  And this album marked the start of major personnel changes over the next few years that would change the musical landscape of this band until it very little resembled the BS&T of it's heyday. By the time ""No Sweat"" came out (Another EXCELLENT album BTW), Katz and Winfield had left and others had 1 foot out the door.  But the good news is, this is a solid effort by a band filled with actual musicians playing actual music THEY wanted to play.

2562,840315,A1EQIRL8ZVZPDN,B003JH0LSW,Rudolph Klapper,False,"It's a bit weird looking at Band of Horses as a mainstay in the Americana genre nowadays when their acclaimed debut, Everything All The Time, came out a mere four years ago. But that's what they've become, for better or worse - in the eyes of this reviewer, the latter, as I've never really been partial to anything the South Carolina-via-Seattle collective has put out. Perhaps that makes it a little odd, then, that Infinite Arms has resonated the strongest with me of all their efforts. I'm not sure what to blame this on, as Infinite Arms still sounds pretty much like both their previous albums. Frontman and main force Ben Bridwell still sounds like a slightly less expressive Jim James, the band still pumps out mellow, inoffensive rock `n roll with a country bent, and everything vaguely reeks of honeysuckle and crisp Northwestern air. Maybe I'm just getting old, but that's just exactly what I like about it - how everything seems reinforced, like Bridwell has finally mastered pairing his songwriting gifts with the studio to create something that sounds perfectly in place, perfectly uniform, and perfectly together, like everything the band has aspired to previously but never quite reached.  It's a sense of familiar comfort more than anything, but when I never really thought of Everything All The Time or Cease To Begin as anything great, it's the subtle craftsmanship of the songs here that end up making Infinite Arms such a success. Opener ""Factory"" encapsulates this feeling better than anything else, swelling strings framing one of Bridwell's most stately, heartbreaking melodies yet. Everything is just so epic, like something that would have fit well on the soundtrack to Cold Mountain or The Assassination of Jesse James. Bridwell sounds more confident than he ever has, be it on the rollicking single ""Compliments,"" the starstruck haze of the title track, or the fearlessly country ""For Annabelle."" Whether it's Bridwell's newfound fatherhood or just that he's comfortable with where he wants Band of Horses to go (deep, deep into the American countryside), Infinite Arms never struggles to find its identity, never wanders about unsure of where to go. The harmonies are stronger, more layered; the music is more fleshed-out, creating a mellow, intimate atmosphere that is far better suited to driving along a backwoods road than listening in a dreary apartment; everything, indeed, is more sonically at rest, flowing rather than forced. Indeed, Bridwell is the real firebrand here, laying down his most versatile performance yet, but it's a performance that never flies off the rails or lapses into lazy platitudes.  The same can't be said for all the songs here, which maintain that same sense of loving attention to detail but occasionally meander about into mid tempo folk sludge. After the awesome throwback to `70s FM rock, ""Dilly,"" there's an unfortunate sequence of tunes that tend to try too hard (""Older"") or simply bore (""Evening Kitchen""). Things pick up before the end with the raucous (by Band of Horses standards) ""NW Apt.,"" but the heart of the record lies in the first half, where the songs paint a picture more of feeling than of any particular image. It's a feeling of familiarity, to be sure; Band of Horses is never going to be accused of being wild innovators like My Morning Jacket were with Evil Urges or entrenched, dyed-in-the-wool revivalists like Fleet Foxes.

What I didn't know is that the UK version of Out Of Our Heads is actually a composite of songs featured on both of the above mentioned US album releases. What you don't get are the hit singles from those albums; Get Off My Cloud, Last Time & Satisfaction. But, the songs included in the UK album feature the Stones, in their prime, covering some classic Motown; Mercy Mercy & Hitch Hike, (Marvin Gaye), Stax Volt; That's How Strong My Love Is, (Otis Redding) and Sam Cooke's timeless classic Good Times.

Scott Stapp played the tortured artist to the hilt on ""My Own Prison"" and millions of anguished young adults that could identify with Stapps' repression flocked to his charismatic vocal style and live performances. To paraphrase our president, Creed wanted to be uniters, not dividers. The universal message of ""One"" brought that sentiment home, to the tune of 11 million copies sold of the debut.  The success led to high expectations for ""Human Clay,"" and the call to arms of ""Higher"" was exactly what most fans probably were looking for. Stapp enticed his followers to join him on his journey and guitarist Mark Tremonti supplied the heroics. There was also the broadening of the world view, via Stapp becoming a father. ""With Arms Wide Open"" is a beautiful song, both deeply personal and universally themed. Creed was also branching out, providing the ""Scream 3"" movie use of ""What If"" as part of the soundtrack (missing from this CD, the cover of Alice Cooper's ""I'm 18"").  For the next album, Creed had become more world weary and defiant, making ""Bullets"" their hardest rocking song to that point. ""Weathered"" took on a tougher stance, but also maintained the band's strongest points in anthems like ""My Sacrifice."" As ""With Arms Wide Open"" pointed out before, there's nothing like a newborn to bring out the emotional heart in any songwriter, and ""Don't Stop Dancing"" followed in that vein.  Creed may have only held together for 3 albums, but they made solid records. The 13 songs here pull the most essential of the band's singles into one disc, and if you aren't already among the millions of listeners that bought the albums, this is as good a collection as you will likely find.  The Bonus DVD is, unfortunately, not a recommendable addition. While a few of the videos are above average (Scott and the band as video heroes in ""Bullets"" and racing around with David Arquette on the set of ""Scream 3"" - ""What If"" - are my two favorites), the DVD is poorly thought out. There is no way to hit a ""play all"" feature, which means you can only play one song at a time, and the menu is difficult to negotiate. And like with most promo videos, cliches abound. There are only so many times you can watch Scott Stapp strike a Jesus Christ pose, as charismatic a performer as he may be. Also, what's up with the editing of the word ""God"" from ""What's This Life For""? You either said it or you didn't....for a band that spent most of its time encouraging conviction, dropping an objectionable phrase seems out of character.

2566,1262647,A1M9WSTQ1M7IGX,B00006YXOX,Mogulmeister,False,"Jochum's DG set is an astonishing achievement and, I would argue, essential for anyone who truly loves Bruckner's symphonies.  Eugen Jochum was arguably one of the greatest conductors ever of Bruckner's symphonies, and this was the one of the first complete cycles ever recorded (I believe Volkmar Andreae's was the first).  Interestingly enough, Karajan had wanted to record the complete Bruckner symphonies, but DG held that project off for nearly a decade because they wanted to first recover their investment in this set, which came first.  Jochum's approach towards Bruckner is generally flexible, which has its plusses and its minuses.  His ability to go beyond the printed score sometimes works miracles (Symphony #1) but other times misses it by a wide margin.  But nothing Jochum does is ever dull, and at its very best, Jochum is an inspired guide to Bruckner's astonishing symphonies.  Jochum's performance of Symphony #1 is ASTONISHING and truly the greatest performance of this utterly radical symphony, which stands out even amongst an overall body of work that is astonishing.  This performance demands to be heard.  Many ""critics"" as well as conductors dismiss the earliest symphonies, but thank goodness Jochum doesn't.  His performance of #1 helps one understand how Bruckner was in fact a revolutionary composer and that Symphony #1 is a completely radical and original piece of music--which in this performance sounds every bit as radical even to this day.  Jochum's performance is an astonishing blast of energy that levels everything in its path.  It's wild, over the top, and sets off sparks and generates white heat that is nearly unimaginable.  To call this performance ""overwhelming"" doesn't do justice to the word.  It's a crazed, manic, and at times unhinged performance of a masterpiece that culminates in a blazing conclusion that obliterates everything in its path and burns pure sunlight.  You can't listen to Jochum's performance and not want to jump up in exuberance by the time it finishes.  The Berlin Philharmonic outdo themselves and, together with Jochum, produce not only the performance of a lifetime, but by far the greatest performance of this work ever recorded.  Syjmphony #1 may not be perfect, but even its flaws don't prevent it from being a masterpiece and an utterly original piece of music, the likes of which have never been heard before or since.  And this is the definitive performance of this masterpiece.  Jochum also gives us outstanding performances of 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  While many consider his performance of the 4th in this set to be a ""great performance,"" I don't care for it because his tempo shifts seem disruptive to me and overall it's a more neurotic performance than it ought to be.  Bruckner's 5th was Jochum's favorite Bruckner symphony, and here it receives an outstanding performance that fully gives this uplifting masterpiece its due.  Jochum recorded the 5th a number of times in his career, and this is to my ears the second-best Jochum performance of the work, succeeded only by his magnificent valedictory live performance of Bruckner's 5th in 1986 with the Concertgebouw, performed three months before he died (released on Tahra--it keeps coming in and out of circulation) -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eugen-Jochum-Bruckner-s-5th-Symphony-Very-Last-Performance-December-1986/dp/B00000662L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eugen Jochum: Bruckner's 5th Symphony -  Very Last Performance (December 1986)</a>.  Jochum's performance of Bruckner's 7th is a truly great performance that holds its own against any other great performance of this symphony (of which there are more than a few).  I like Jochum's performance of the 8th, except for the fact that he plays the Nowak edition with its disruptive cuts in the 3rd and 4th movements.  More than a few Brucknerians are not fans of this performance, but it works for me, and the urgency Jochum brings to the 4th movement in particular is particularly effective.  Jochum's performance of the 6th symphony also deserves special mention.  It's a wildly uneven performance that delivers a superlative first movement, but the remaining three movements are performed routinely although capably, and lack the distinction that Jochum brings to the first movement.  Overall it's an effective performance, but unfortunately it falls short of greatness.  But let's talk about that first movement, because the performance of it is astonishing.  Everything about it is perfect--the setting of the rhythm, the pacing, the playing, and the balance.  But when Jochum arrives at the famous coda--wow--the performance moves into the other-worldly, and takes us to places no other conductor has ever taken us to before.  It's beautiful, moving, soaring, life-affirming, and truly astonishing.  I would argue that the coda to the first movement of the 6th symphony is the greatest bit of writing Bruckner ever did, and no one has ever realized its greatness to the degree that Jochum does in this specific performance.  It's worth the price of admission.  Sadly, Jochum's performances of #2 and #9 are clear misses.  It's a bit surprising that his performance of #9 is so incoherent, but for whatever reason, it never gells and to my ears is an unsuccessful reading.  Notwithstanding the misfires, the achievements of this set are superb.  The highs are exceptionally high, and much of it is astonishing.  Jochum's DG/Berlin Philharmonic/Bavarian Radio Symphony orchestra set is a better-played, better-recorded set than the Dresden cycle on EMI, and to my ears, a top choice not just among Jochum's sets of Bruckner's, but anyone's.  The only Bruckner cycle that surpasses this one is Karajan's brilliant set with the Berlin Philharmonic on DG.  But Karajan's #1 is a failure (the only one in the set), and while Karajan's #6 overall is superior to Jochum's, Jochum's performance of the first movement--the most important part of the piece--is unsurpassed.  I also prefer Jochum's #7 to Karajan's #7.  My best advice to those who love Bruckner:  Buy both Jochum's DG and Karajan's sets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruckner-9-Symphonies-Box-Set/dp/B001DCQI8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruckner: 9 Symphonies [Box Set</a>].

2571,673896,A1DU3J9DO1RCDY,B000IU3YLY,Mr. Wayne Olsen,False,"It is tempting to look at Kevin Federline's album and think ""another nail in the coffin of popular music.""  That Britney Spears' bad-boy freeloader husband gets a major label shot in these days of consolidation seems like a crime.  The first single from this record ""Lose Control"" did not offer much hope, the type of clichd hip hop/pop product beloved by twelve-year-olds and the radio programmers that serve them.  It is that much more shocking that ""Playing With Fire"" is a daring, exciting, marvelously ingenious album, as good as anything released this year.  Only the single and ""Dance With a Pimp"" could be defined hip-hop; the rest of the album is a dizzyingly inventive mix of sixties rock, seventies singer-songwriter, prog rock, R&B and even classical.  KFed obviously had some help putting this together, but the album credits are uninformative.  Rumors of superstar appearances cannot be confirmed; they can only be guessed at.  The album opens with ""The World is Mine,"" but rather than a boastful rap, it is a summer-of-love anthem.  The funky organ is played by Rascal Felix Cavaliere, whose timeless singing back-up for K-Fed's soaring vocal.  ""America's Most Hated"" follows, a hard-rock shouter that would not have been out of place on Nevermind.  ""Snap"" is a funky soul groove that Prince has been trying to write for the last 15 years.  The track deftly samples ""'Round Midnight,"" ""Maybe Your Baby,"" and ""No Pussyfooting.""  Through three songs, one is immediately impressed with K-Fed's vocals.  This wonder is maintained throughout the whole album.  On the slow tracks, he sounds like a cross between Carl Wilson and Paul McCartney; on the up-tempo songs, he can bring it like Sam Cooke or Bobby Womack.  ""Lose Control"" comes next, and though it breaks momentum, it is immediately followed by the other hip-hop track, ""Dance Like a Pimp (featuring Ya Boy.)"" This hard, almost grungy rap song was originally supposed to feature Ya Kid K, but when she and Felly were unavailable, Ya Boy was enlisted.  ""Dance Like a Pimp"" will upset many people in the rap community, being an eloquent indictment of hip-hop's misogyny, violence, homophobia, racism and nihilism.  ""Privilege (featuring Bosko)"" follows.  Co-written with Roger Waters, this song addresses a topic close to K-Fed's heart: how the upper classes of Fresno escaped any hardship during World War II, while the poorer families lost loved ones on the field of battle.  It is a mystery who ""Bosko"" is, but that ringing guitar solo can be no one else but Waters' Pink Floyd mate, David Gilmour.  A cover of Willie Nelson's ""Crazy"" may seem unnecessary, but it makes a charming duet with Britney.  ""A League of My Own"" is a touching tribute to women's baseball.  The title track features a guitar riff that Pete Townshend will probably kick himself that he didn't think of it first.  K-Fed plays some mean harmonica as the track fades out into ""Caught Up,"" which features Steve Winwood on organ, Mike Campbell on twelve-string, and Jeff Lynne on bass.  If everything so far has been pretty terrific, it is the last track ""Keep On Talkin'"" that transcends any expectations.  Clocking in at twenty-four minutes, it starts off with K-Fed singing a beautiful melody with acoustic guitar (sounds like Jimmy Page!) accompaniment.  Slowly, the song builds momentum as a traditional rock backing shifts the song into second gear.  A short interlude with Indian percussion, sarod and sitar is interrupted by an all-out assault of screaming guitars.  K-Fed shouts himself hoarse as he rails against the injustices of the world.  Suddenly, chimes, celli, and harmonium bring peace to the maelstrom.  KFed starts singing a soaring new melody, a beautiful guitar (Gilmour again?) doubles his voice, a choir and full orchestra take up the melody and if you don't have goose-bumps by this point, you're dead.  K-Fed's vocal breaks off, and the final four minutes or so are an orchestral coda that on first listen sounded Mahlerian, but now I'm convinced it's more like late-period Bruckner.  The chime of a bell fades into silence.  I have listened to this album seven times today.  Up until now, Sgt. Pepper, Blonde on Blonde and Kind of Blue have been the standard against which all music is measured.

2573,879803,A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B005DTERHA,Jef Fazekas,True,"Wow...talk about a wild ride! Lindsey Buckingham's latest, SEED WE SOW, has got me straddling a musical seesaw! On the one hand, there are some very nice moments. On the other, there's really nothing new here...the disc could easily be made up of outtakes from either of his two previous releases, 2006's UNDER THE SKIN or GIFT OF SCREWS from 2008.  I also have to admit that, after numerous listens, I'm kind of shocked to hear people comparing this disc favorably to 1992's OUT OF THE CRADLE...this disc has none of that earlier effort's variety or adventurous nature. Instead, we just have a lot more of the two elements that seem to have become Buckingham's stock in trade now...whispery vocals and shimmery, lightning speed finger picking.  Opening things up is the hushed title track. Blessed with an atmospheric arrangement and minimal, yet intense, instrumentation ~ it's almost as if Buckingham's guitar chords are living, pulsating entities! ~ the song just tumbles out of the speakers. Buckingham's restrained vocal caresses the lyrics, including the album's best lines: ""Sweet things/Pretty things/Are dying/In the penny arcade/Of Edgar Allan Poe."" Very nice.  ""In Our Own Time"" is a prime example of what's so frustrating about SEEDS WE SOW....first off, the track just sounds so insular and manufactured ~ there's nothing organic whatsoever about it. Buckingham might as well be painting by numbers...the whirlwind finger-picking goes here, the shouted vocal goes there. Where's the creative mastermind behind TUSK, a project that keeps you guessing and that you never know what's coming next? Sorry, but this track has a bad case of ""been there, done that""-itis!  ""Illumination"" is one of SWS's best cuts, not because it's deep or profound, but because it steps outside of the creative box that Buckingham seems content to store himself in these days. Edgy, in-your-face percussion dominates the song, brilliantly contrasting the sparkling guitars. An urgent, heated vocal perfectly rounds out this little gem. THIS is what we need more of!  Ditto ""That's The Way Love Goes."" With a full band of bass, drums and keyboards behind him, Buckingham is a completely different man....he's a lot loser and freer. You can even hear it in his playing....his guitar just WAILS here! Contrary to popular belief, Buckingham DOES play well with others, and he should do it more often! Sweet!  After the blistering rock guitar of the previous track, the acoustic finger-picking dervish of ""Stars Are Crazy"" just accentuates the fact that said rock guitar is really, REALLY missed. ""Stars..."" is the sort of track that has dominated the last three discs...manic acoustic strumming, frantic vocals, opaque lyrics. One of SWS's weaker moments.  The same can be said about ""When She Comes Down."" Though the track has a lovely melody, this isn't really a song...it's just a dozen lines, repeated two times each. Needless to say, by the time we reach the midway point of the cut's total 4:48 length, a severe case of monotony has set in. Once again, we've heard this kind of track NUMEROUS times in the last six years...time to move on!  I can only imagine what some bass and drums would have added to ""Rock Away Blind"", but it's still one of the disc's premiere cuts, if just for it's lyrics. Lines such as ""For your love I must be on time/Wait for hours alone by your shrine"", ""I won't look for what I might find"" and ""I can go crazy without even trying"" just shine. Toss in an honest, earnest lead vocal and you have a real winner.  ""One Take"" is another favorite of mine....again, not because it's a classic, but because it's fresh and fun and far out in left field, certainly compared to much of the rest of the album. From the spirited lead vocal, to the rip-roaring solo, back to the layered vocals on the bridge...THIS is what you expect from Lindsey Buckingham...something UNexpected! To quote a classic movie line: ""I would like some more, please!""  ""Gone Too Far"" lopes along at a nice pace, but I can't help but think this baby could have gone from good to great if Buckingham had brought in a crack rhythm section (wonder where he could have found one of those??) and a haunting female voice on backing vocals (Any ideas???). Yet another example of a ""could have been!"" If only....!  There's a delicate groove to ""End Of Time"" that is absolutely captivating. It is, without a doubt, the album's true core, it's most honest, REAL moment. Amid a muted, yet strong, arrangement, minimal, yet lively, instrumentation and a heartfelt lead vocal, everything just gels, right from the classic opening line of ""Sliding down the karma slide."" Another fave, and certainly one of the disc's best cuts.  Things wind up with another Rolling Stones cover, this time being the vintage ""She Smiled Sweetly.""

2577,539634,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B0000A0DRW,Missing Person,True,"I picked up this CD on something of a lark, and what a mind-blower it's turned out to be.  ""Jefferson Airplane Takes Off"", originally released in September of 1966, is an astonishing debut album.  The liner notes of this particular CD edition point out that this is basically a 'live in the studio' album, without much overdubbing or ""studio experimentation"", but that just makes the Airplane's accomplishment here all the more impressive--clearly these guys knew exactly what they were doing.  The playing on this album is sensational.  A ton of credit has to go to Marty Balin--not only is he one of the best, most expressive vocalists in all of '60s rock, but he seemed to have some kind of sixth sense in terms of assembling the original band lineup, and apart from 3 covers, he wrote or co-wrote the remaining 8 songs on the original album.  You CERTAINLY shouldn't get it in your head that this can't be as good as later albums due to the absence of Grace Slick.  Yes, Grace is great, of course, and incredibly distinctive.  But Signe Anderson, in her only album ever with the band, absolutely soars on her vocal spotlight ""Chauffeur Blues"", and although she's not involved in any of the songwriting, she plays a vital role in the group's frequent, rich harmony arrangements.  Also, don't let people who tag this as a 'folk-rock' record give you the wrong idea--it's actually an extremely versatile album.  The album opener ""Blues From An Airplane"" (co-written by Skip Spence) is a superb, ominous acid rocker that captivates you immediately with its droning guitars and Jack Casady's thunderous bass.  Paul Kantner steps up to the mic for a devastating lead vocal turn on the mind-blowingly awesome ""Let Me In"", a ferocious, cathartic, cleverly-timed garage rocker stuffed with blistering riffs and a smoking Jorma Kaukonen solo.  The deviously laidback shuffle ""Bringing Me Down"" has sort of a Byrds-y jangle to it, matched with a quasi-bluesy pattern, melodic bass, and a great descending riff sequence.  Marty Balin's one solo composition ""It's No Secret"" is a brilliant love song--Balin's exuberant, from the gut vocals on it are intoxicating, and the song's surprising bridge section elevates it to a whole other level of genius.  The cover of ""Tobacco Road"" is superly done, with its moody opening guitar passage setting the stage perfectly.  The 6/8 ballad ""Come Up The Years"" is an achingly lovely and bittersweet love song with an appropriately shimmering glockenspiel part.  ""Run Around"" has a manic, arpegiatted guitar part that just knocks your socks off.  Kaukonen brings on a full-blown slow blues vibe for ""And I Like It"", a defiant, yet deeply emotional epic with a wrenching solo vocal from Balin--it was a brilliant way to end the original album.  You can hardly even pick out favorite songs on here, and album plays out like a truly unified, ingeniously-conceived, timeless work of art.  A big thumbs up to RCA for the inclusion of 9 bonus tracks, including a 'hidden' instrumental version of ""Blues From An Airplane"" at the end.  We get the 'original uncensored version' of ""Let Me In"" which 'accidentally' appeared on a very limited number of early pressings of the original vinyl album--RCA had issues with some of the lyrics and the band re-recorded it from scratch, which proved to be a blessing because the subsequent 'regular' version of the song is more forcefully performed, although the 'uncensored' version is still terrific and fascinating from a historical standpoint.  ""High Flying Bird"" wasn't included on the original album, perhaps because they felt they already had one gloomy cover song with ""Tobacco Road"", and ""...Bird"" does have a similar feel, but it's wisely appended here.  The 'early version' of the rocker ""Go To Her"" and an 8+ minute take of ""And I Like It"" are just a couple more goodies that round out what appears to be THE definitive version of this beyond-classic album (although some fans may also want the version that presents the whole album in mono & stereo versions).

From the seminal Why, Walking on Broken Glass, Little Bird to No More ""I Love You's"" and Wonderful, there's too much to mention. Listen to Why and tell me who the original Diva is.

The videos are nothing short of spectacular except the badly-conjured Pavement Cracks mash-up video. Watch Why, Little Bird and Waiting in Vain and enough is said.  For a true Lennox fan, this collection does not replace the joy of owning each of her 4 albums that offer so much more than you can ever find in music today.

2580,561169,A3VE5YUAP03TDC,B0001HN5UE,kansasken,False,"Like many a sodbuster who braved life on the prairie, the members of Proto-Kaw are unsung heroes. They were pioneers of progressive rock in America and like the pioneers who came to the plains a century before them, they paved the way for those who came after. But pioneering is hard. Many do not make it, even giving it all they have; the elements are sometimes too much and there comes a time to pack it in. 30 years ago, Kansas was not a place where progressive rock thrived and try as they might, Proto-Kaw (then simply known as Kansas), was forced to give up their dream and turn to other ways of life. However, they paved the way for the band that immediately followed their footsteps. Kerry Livgren, the song smith for the band joined forces with another group, White Clover, who picked up the now unused moniker: Kansas. The new Kansas picked up where their predecessors left off and managed to hold on until they were discovered. They went on to define the American sound of progressive rock. That could have been the end for the first Kansas and for many years that is how it appeared. However, that is not the end of the story, because in 2002 the early demo recordings had become popular bootlegs in Europe and were available for download on the internet. Cuneiform Records became interested and released them on CD, but the band needed a new name and thus began the resurrection of Proto-Kaw (Proto: first or earlier - Kaw: the Native American name for Kansas). How many bands can say that they have back to back album releases recorded 30 years apart? Thirty years after the dream of success as a band died and had been laid to rest, the dream has now been resurrected with the band reuniting to record an all new album. Before Became After is a weaving of old and new. The band is comprised of original members, Lynn Meredith, vocals; Kerry Livgren, guitars, keys & compositions; Dan Wright, keyboards; John Bolton, sax & flute; Brad Schulz, drums; plus newcomer Craig Kew, bass, who worked with Livgren on an earlier solo release. The songs, too, are a blending of old and new. Livgren updated songs the band played 30 years ago and added new compositions into a seamless fabric of their new sound. Which is which? It's impossible to tell unless you were around when the band first began performing 30 years ago. The new Proto-Kaw is fresh, but more mature. Gone are the blood curdling banshee wailings from Bolton's sax, but no less frenetic is some of his playing than his younger days, coupled with some very lyrical flute work.  Gone, too, are the occasional stretches of experimental cacophony. The new music is much more euphonious progressive rock tinged with jazz improvisation shifting in tone and color as quickly as the weather of the band's home state. It is a bit hard to describe the band's sound because it is so varied and constantly shifting, not just from song to song, but within songs themselves there can be elements of soaring beauty which segue into rocking jams. In fact, there is very much the feel of a jam band within a nearly classical framework in its complexity. Before Became After is great ensemble playing and the compositions give rise to some fine solo work, an interplay between Wright's keyboards, Livgren's guitar or Bolton's woodwinds, all anchored by some fine bass & drum work by Kew & Schulz. Meredith uses his voice as an instrument, just as the different ranges of sound produced by his instrumentalist band mates, his voice reflecting and inflecting just the right sound to fit the song. Truly, Meredith sounds better today than he did 30 years ago, which can't be said of many vocalists. There will likely be the temptation to compare Proto-Kaw to other bands, especially their well known successor, but this is unwarranted as Proto-Kaw is very much their own band, with a sound that is their own. What is familiar lies at the heart of their music, the song writing of Kerry Livgren. As with any composer there are elements that are recognizable from song to song, a phrasing or chord progression. As an author's use of language keeps readers coming back for more, so does Livgren's writing, both musically & lyrically. The Occasion of Your Honest Dreaming, departs from the prog format in a joyful straight ahead light rock number with an infectious melody sung as a group vocal. My only criticism would be the ending of one of the most powerful songs on the CD, Theophany, which builds in dynamic crescendo & tempo to the final chord, but then has an extra beat with just bass and drums, sounding more like a minor miscued cutoff than a well planned anti-climax. That aside, this is an outstanding album and all the more joyous when you consider how it came to be, how long it was in coming. There is a line in Axolotl which says: ""Dreams don't mean a thing until they're real."" Surely these dreams mean something now, because this is the real thing.

This compilation contains all the tracks from those two albums except No room at the inn and Born in Bethlehem. It also contains two extra tracks, The season will never grow old and Have yourself a merry little Christmas, recorded in the early nineties for another Christmas album, plus several new tracks recorded for this album. The nineties Christmas album also included Deck the halls, Ding dong merrily on high and Jingle bells. It is a pity that those tracks (along with No room at the inn and Born in Bethlehem) were not added to this collection, but this is still a very fine collection. The new recordings for this collection are Let it snow, O little town of Bethlehem, It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, First Noel, Hark the herald angels sing, a medley of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer and Frosty the snowman and a Santa medley (Jolly old Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus is coming to town, Here comes Santa Claus). These recordings make this collection desirable for those Anne Murray fans who already had her earlier Christmas releases, which are no longer in print. Among the other classic Christmas songs that everybody knows, I particularly like her version of Silver bells, but Anne is also in top form on Joy to the world, Little drummer boy, White Christmas, It came upon the midnight clear, I'll be home for Christmas, Do you hear what I hear, O holy night, Winter wonderland, Go tell it on the mountain, The Christmas song, O come all ye faithful, Away in a manger, We three kings, Mary's boy child and Silent night.

The first thing that jumps out at you is the beefed-up rhythm section,with ace stick-man Bill Berry unleashing a massive wallop,which could also be credited to the clearer,more substantial production. Gone is the airy,mysterious haze of yore,replaced here with muscular,strait ahead rockers. And,perhaps most significantly,you can hear every word coming out of Micheal Stipe's famously muffled mouth.

The problem with Nathan Milstein was that he played way too well,  seemingly without effort - and consistently.  He was still sounding every bit as good at age 83 as he was in this video (at age 69).  Boult, well into his 80s at the time this was made, gives perfect direction of the Beethoven - although the orchestra pretty much remains in shadow whenever Milstein is on the platform.  Never one for conventionality, Milstein plays his own cadenzas - these are musically unusual, but a refreshing change from the ones by Joachim and others which are heard in nearly all performances and recordings.  The Vaughan-Williams Symphony #8 is fine - Boult recorded all of them in the 60s (I think with the LSO?) and he knew them extremely well.  Why it was included with the Beethoven Concerto, I'm not quite sure.  Maybe they should have just released the entire concert from start to finish?

Is it possible to derive greater enjoyment from jazz than this? I ask myself this question every time I listen to this album. It's built like the great pop albums: at the end of each song, you immediately anticipate the start of the next, and experience immense pleasure when you hear that piano again.  The trio one of the most celebrated piano trios in the history of the music is tight, swinging, exquisitely balanced. Peterson's most personal moment on the album is perhaps the final ""Hymn to Freedom"". It is such a moving piece I'm often driven to playing it for its own sake, but nothing gives it greater emotional power than the music that precedes it. It's as if the whole album were recorded just to provide a context for ""Hymn"" to stand out in this way. A jubilant record is closed a with a pensive poem.  The record is dedicated to Peterson's father, a sleeping-car attendant on Canadian Pacific Railways.  The Peterson Trio's NIGHT TRAIN is definitely one of the most famous jazz recordings of all-time. It is easy to hear why. This album is packed with classic be-bop jazz. NIGHT TRAIN is also one of the most immediately enjoyable and listenable jazz albums, much like Dave Brubeck's TIME OUT or John Coltrane's MY FAVORITE THINGS.

Least comfortable for me was the suspicion that this was a sneaky attempt to force a religious message on me, by dressing up spiritual thoughts as love songs. And then I heard an interview with Darden that put a different slant on things. He revealed that ""Shadow"" is about the darker side of himself that he's found a way to accept, and when you know this, it makes sense. If there's a message in ""Sunflower"", it's that you can see the beauty in things if you put your mind to it, and that this has the potential to change your life. If that sounds trite, it's not the way it comes over in the songs, and ""Easier Said Than Done"" explicitly explores the difficulties of living out the message very neatly. ""New Gospel"" on the other hand, perhaps the most curious song on the album, uses all the language of religion, in an almost irreverent way, to ""preach"" the idea. Novel. None of this would be any good though if ""Sunflower"" was musically substandard, and I'm happy to report that it is anything but. In fact, it is nothing short of miraculous. Take a song like ""Stronger"". It's a defiant song about getting over a relationship, with an almost gleeful background of distorted guitars, very subtle, but rising like a cry of freedom rises in the throat. That's typical of the way these songs are punctuated musically. There's evidence of it all over the album, like the playful piano ""full-stop"" that marks the end of ""Stronger"" and the geometric rhythms of the beautiful ""Perfect Moment"", one of my favourite tracks.

Released after their much heralded ""Out of The Blue"" album, ELO continues with their tried and tested formula and somehow managed to score again with ""Discovery"" which features an even more exquisite blend of classical and electronic  rock.  How can one not enjoy this album when it features such unforgettable melodies coupled with racy and thumping beats? ""Last Train to London"" and ""Shine a Little Love"" proved their successful formula all over again as these songs are immediately catchy and yet very original.  Repeated listenings will uncover more gems like ""Confusion"", ""Diary of Horace Wimp"" and ""On The Run"". So many good songs and all in one album! How did they do it back then, huh?

Every song is a standout really, but I'll attempt to select a few of my favourites. The stunning lilting ""Second chance"", The sombre ""gather to the chapel"", the bouncy ""Lead balloon"", the spare acoustic ""Fire in your belly"" (with hymnal harmonies), the ghostly sounding a capella ""Lullaby"", the bouncy ""Energy spirit"" (great drumming breaks), and the falsetto sung ""Music moves my feet"".

2641,331436,A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B000008FS6,John Alapick ,False,"Welcome to the Pleasuredome is the first of two albums from Frankie Goes to Hollywood, an outfit that was to the U.K. what Vanilla Ice was to the U.S., in the fact that their time in the spotlight was both brief and unforgettable. The band wasn't just popular in 1984, they were downright gigantic. Upon being banned from the BBC, their first single, ""Relax"", would spend several weeks at # 1, only to be followed by their next single, ""Two Tribes"", which would become one of the biggest singles in U.K. history. Both of these songs would eventually become popular in the U.S., with ""Relax"" becoming a Top 10 hit. Then after their following album, Liverpool, hit the charts for about a cup of coffee, they were gone. Also like Vanilla Ice's hit album, To the Extreme, Welcome to the Pleasuredome was pretty much a studio creation, in this case masterminded by former Yes member and producer Trevor Horn. The production is very impressive for its era; it's perhaps the best sounding `80s album that you'll ever hear. However, unlike To the Extreme, Welcome to the Pleasuredome, while clearly reminiscent of the era with its heavy synth and the Ronald Reagan impersonator, still holds up well. Also worth noting is that their frontman, Holly Johnson, was a very charismatic lead vocalist who probably would have had a decent career if he didn't decide to become a recluse.  Having said all of this, Welcome to the Pleasuredome is a classic release for its first half before becoming hit and miss the rest of the way. The tribal title track, all 13 minutes and 40 seconds of it, is fantastic, and a video would later gain some MTV airplay albeit in a much shorter version. ""Relax"" is a classic, one of the catchiest and most risqu songs of the 80's. ""Two Tribes"" is even better. Led by its kinetic bass line and a manic energetic beat, it is simply one of the most exciting songs to hit the charts. And the video, which features Ronald Reagan and Konstantin Chernenko (thanks for the correction, Patrick) battling it out in a sand pit with the band and other world leaders looking on, has to be seen to be believed.  While not on the level of the original versions, covers of Edwin Starr's ""War"" and Bruce Springsteen's ""Born to Run"" are also very good. The moody instrumental ""The Ballad of 32"" and the ballad ""The Power of Love"", which would also hit #1 in the U.K., are strong tracks and add some diversity. However, songs like ""Krisco Kisses"", ""Wish the Lads Were Here"", and ""The Only Star In Heaven"", while maintaining the energy of ""Relax"" and ""Two Tribes"", are decent at best. The versions of ""Ferry across the Mersey"" and ""San Jose"" also don't stand out.

And as much as people seemed to like his last album, R&G, I really didn't think it was that great. But Snoop appears to be refocused on Tha Blue Carpet Treatment.  Snoop's lead singles often have a habit of growing on me; thus, while I originally thought ""That's That Ish"" sucked, I think it's fine now. Other good songs are ""Imagine"", ""Think About It"" and ""Get a Light"". But as other reviewers have mentioned, the Nate Dogg-assisted ""Crazy"" is easily the best track.  Sadly, there are a number of flaws on the album as well. First off, there are way too many guest stars, something that is pretty hard to overlook on a 78-minute, 21-track album. Still, the two songs with Akon (""Boss' Life"" and ""I Wanna Love You"") impress. But then Snoop joins up with E-40, MC Eiht, Kurupt and others on the ironically titled ""Don't Stop"". Fortunately, things work out better when 40 and Eiht are on ""Candy"" (but that song also features Snoop yelling: ""DEEZ NUTS!!!""; what is this, 1992?). And the Jamie Foxx-assisted ""Psst"" is corny; and besides, that song was better when it was called ""Drop It Like It's Hot"".  ""Round Here"" is okay, but that Dido ""Thank You"" sample doesn't do it justice. ""Which One of You"" suffers from the repetition of ""Which one of you b's like me"" throughout the entire song, and the story ""A B I Knew"" isn't anything to run and tell a friend about. And ""Gangbangn 101"" is completely unlistenable. Finally, ""Beat Up on Yo Pads"", Snoop's homage to his youth football league, is noble, but it just doesn't belong on an album like this.  While this isn't as bad as R&G, a much better blue carpet treatment would have been cutting all the filler because this is really just another one of those buy-this-only-to-complete-your-[artist's name here]-collection albums.

2658,131191,A1BS8YM712C0VJ,B000002B7P,Will Culp,False,"Released in 1981, Diary of a Madman is Ozzy Osbourne's second album, and the last to feature guitarist Randy Rhoads. After the Blizzard of Ozz tour, Ozzy and Co. were soon about to embark on another tour. Desperate to have new material for the tour, Ozzy hurriedly recorded and released Diary of a Madman. Despite the band being rushed, Diary of a Madman proved to be one of Ozzy's strongest efforts to date, and in my opinion, his shining moment. Featuring the ever-maturing Neo-Classical Electric Guitar playing from Randy Rhoads, his far-reaching talent for mind-bending solos and addictive riffs has made him a legend to this day, and he is rivalled only by Kirk Hammett(Of Metallica) for the Grand Title of the Best Guitarist Ever. Since this was Rhoads' last album(He was on Blizzard of Ozz and Quiet Riot's First 2 CDs also), it is hard to bear just thinking about what he and Ozzy could have done in the rest of the 80's, but sadly that was not to be because of his death in a freak plane crash. Also, the production is much better on Diary of a Madman, as Ozzy's vocals, Tommy Aldridge's Drumming, and Rudy Sarzo's bass all seem much more pronounced than on Blizzard of Ozz. After Diary of a Madman was released, it immediately capatilized on the success of Blizzard of Ozz and shot up the charts to Number 16 on the sucess of the singles ""Flying High Again"", ""Over the Mountain"", and ""You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll"". Even today, you still hear ""Flying High Again"" and ""Over the Mountain"" frequently, while ""You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll"" has kind of faded out of the airwaves. And for all those people out there who need to get their daily dose of ballads, you certainly get the needed doseage with such songs as ""You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll"",""Tonight"", and ""Diary of a Madman"". But don't fret hard rockers! You still get classics such as ""Over the Mountain"", ""Flying High Again"",""Believer"", and many more to deafen your ears. Weighing in at a mere 8 tracks, Diary of a Madman still manages to clock in at 43 Minutes and 26 seconds, which is a lot more than you can say for a 12-Track Blink 182 or Good Charlotte album! Below you will find Track-By-Track reviews for each song to see just why this album is so great. Song Reviews: Over The Mountain-10/10:Like any first song on an album should do, ""Over the Mountain"" gets and holds your attention. With Aldridge's drumming at the beginning and Rhoad's killer riff to start it off, Ozzy immediately takes over and steals the show with his great vocals. The Solo from Rhoads' is one of the best you will ever hear! Flying High Again-10213910293012/10: BEST OZZY SONG EVER! Ozzy's ode to a certain type of drug manages to never get old even though I've listened to it millions of times! Rhoads'superb riff, Ozzy's sarcastic vocals, and Sarzo's insanely addictive bass beat all combine to create the best song on the album. Randy Rhoad's solo is once again tremendously good, and you'll be singing right along with Ozzy to the chorus! You Can't Kill Rock 'N Roll-10/10: Ozzy is really the only guy who can even serve up a decent ballad, and once again he doesn't fail to please! Rhoads' soulful acoustic guitar playing and Ozzy's heartfelt vocals might even bring tears to the soft-hearted eyes. One of the best chorus' on this album and probably the best lyrics. Rhoads' solo is insane! Believer-10/10: This song starts off with Sarzo's catchy bass beat that I can't get out of my head! Rhoads' kind of spooky guitar playing and Ozzy's brooding vocals make this song sound very creepy! Perfect to play when all the Trick-or-Treaters come to your door! As usual, a good chorus and a masterful solo by Rhoads! Little Dolls-9/10: Almost a ballad in a way, this song is a hard rocker with very soulful vocals by Ozzy and a very soul-searching chorus. Aldridge's drumming is especially good on this song, as is Sarzo's bass beat. Gets downgraded because Rhoads' solo is short and fairly unremarkable, but his riff is as addictive as ever! Tonight-10/10: Once again Ozzy serves up a great ballad, where the guitar and drums take a backseat to the keyboard and synthesizer, and most importantly Ozzy's melodramatic vocals that seem to match the song perfectly. Don't fret though! There is still a solo from Rhoads, and it happens to be great! S.A.T.O-10/10: Aldridge and Rhoads truly are playing top-notch together on this song, and 2 minutes in they team up to do a 1-Minute instrumental that combines Rhoads' insane solo with Aldridge's precise drumming. After that Ozzy comes in and delivers some great vocals. Diary of a Madman-10/10: The 3rd ballad on Diary of a Madman, it starts off loud with Rhoads' unforgiving riff but soon switches to Ozzy's brooding vocals that are truly a standout on this album. Rhoads' acoustic playing is great here, along with his solo which is certainly no slouch either. The chorus is great, and the song sounds very creepy! Overall, this album is a masterpiece and is probably Ozzy's strongest. As you can see, every song on the album has great vocals and great solos from Ozzy and Randy Rhoads that truly make this Ozzy's best album. This album will satisfy any tastes in rock music, and if you're a fan of Metal, Classic Rock, or even Modern Rock you'll enjoy this album to the fullest. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! RECOMMENDED FOR ANYBODY WHO LIKES ROCK MUSIC IN GENERAL! ALONG WITH BLIZZARD OF OZZ, DIARY OF A MADMAN SHOULD BE THE ALBUM TO GET IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET INTO OZZY OR RANDY RHOADS!

2660,946683,A2F2MQKBB4CYPF,B00BEOYPKW,John W. Evans,True,"To be honest, I was somewhat underwhelmed by Kurt Viles' last album, ""Smoke Ring For My Halo"".  There were a couple of songs that completely wowed me (""In My Time"" and the title track) but I didn't care as much for the rest of it.  To my way of thinking, that album sounded like a talented guy finding his way musically who maybe wasn't there yet.  But based on what I saw as Vile's potential from those songs I liked so much, I decided to give his newest one ""Wakin On A Pretty Daze"" a try.  I'm pretty much wowed by this one from start to finish.  It is without a doubt the best thing I have heard this year so far, and one of the more amazing records I've heard in a long time!  This time Vile uses a full band sound throughout, and the lengthy tracks allow the songs to stretch out a bit.  And they stretch out into some pretty far-reaching places.  The moods range from a dreamy meditation on love and responsibility (""Too Hard"") to an uptempo driver brimming with confidence (""Was All Talk) to beautifully-constructed pop (""Snowflakes Are Dancing"" and ""Never Run Away"") to steady, muscular psychedelia (""Girl Called Alex"" and ""Air Bud"").  There are other goodies mixed in, like the lovely and languid nine-minutes-plus opening track ""Wakin On A Pretty Day"" and the capstone of the album, the lush ten-minute ""Goldtone"".  Vile is ably assisted by his band, The Violators, over the course of the album.  He and his two compadres create some beautiful sounds, and there are lap steel contributions by guest contributor Farmer Dave Scher in ""Girl Called Alex"", ""Too Hard"" and ""Pure Pain"" that elevate those songs from ""good"" to ""great"".  While there is lots of talk about Kurt Vile as a songwriter (and he is very good at that), attention should be paid to his skills as an arranger and musician.  There aren't many people around lately who do all those things all at once as well as does, and ""Wakin On A Pretty Daze"" showcases his considerable talent in astounding fashion.  Some people may find his ultra-relaxed vocal style to be an acquired taste, but once you listen to the way he uses it as an instrument in these songs, I believe you will be sold on it.  This album is a total package, and for me it's pure satisfaction.  Check out the dreamy passages in ""Pure Pain""...  most of the last several minutes of ""Was All Talk""... the high atmospherics of ""Snowflakes Are Dancing""... the instrumental entirety of ""Too Hard""...  the four-and-a-half-minute mark in ""Air Bud"" when the music busts back in and then for the minute or so after that...  There really is so much ear candy on this record that it's hard to describe it adequately.  ""Sometimes when I get in my zone you'd think I was stoned but I never, as they say, touch the stuff.  I might be adrift, but I'm still alert, concentrate my hurt into a gold tone...  golden tones.""  Those are the words of a young musician who is searching for the lost chord.  And it in some places on this record, I believe Kurt Vile finds it.

We rode around in my old Taurus listening to American Standard constantly.  So, in 97, when Rock Crown came out my friend bought the CD and we rocked to Needle Can't Burn all the way from Morganton to Carowinds in Charlotte.  I didn't give the softer songs a chance then, and I was completely turned off by Honey of Generation.  Well, I'm still turned off by Honey, and I don't think that will ever change.  But now, listening to the CD(which I haven't heard a single time since summer of 97) is a beautiful escape.  Needle Can't Burn is now an awesome trip back in time to the summer I was 19 and getting ready to finally move off to college.  Listening to songs like Houdini's Angels and Lucky really show me a side of 7M3 that we don't see much of anymore.  I'm not good at describing how such lyrics can make you feel, but the songs seem personal and heartfelt, and the musical accompaniment is perfect.  I did go on to buy Orange Avenue and Economy of Sound, but somehow they just don't compare, unfortunately.  This one will go down in History as one of my classics.  I smile when I hear it.

Com to see how difficult it can be to secure a copy of this highly underrated masterwork from one of the most seminal rock outfits in music history.  Amazon lists ""Winds of Change"" as requiring 3 to 6 weeks for delivery, rather than the typical turnaround of ""usually available within 24 hours.""  Why!?!  ""3 to 6 weeks"" sometimes means - ""not available at all,"" at least from my own personal experience with Amazon.  I wait 3 to 6 weeks for my item, then I wait a few weeks more.  Finally Amazon writes to me with regrets that, in fact, they cannot get me the pristine copy of whatever it is I have ordered in the first place.  Like - ""Total Bummmer, Dudes!""  Fortunately, Amazon now provides ""Used"" outlets, including the ability to obtain BRAND SPANKING NEW copies of CDs, DVDs, books and so on forth at sometimes WAY SIGNIFICANTLY reduced prices (hooray!), through third-party, independent vendors, working with Amazon.  This is very, VERY GOOD news for us beleaguered buyers in quest of that elusive ""media gem,"" whatever it happens to be.  In fact, at last check, ""Winds of Change"" is currently available now, with a one-to-two business-day turnaround, from ""8 used and new"" sources independent of Amazon, but accessible (and purchasable) via Amazon's website.  Yippee!  Because ""Winds of Change"" in my book is one of Starship's PREMIER albums of all time, regardless of what anyone else tells you.  Whether it was poor marketing or whatever that tanked this brilliant creation, the fact remains:  ""W.O.C."" is probably J.S.'s best kept secret.  But I'm telling it to you now.  There are 6 fantastic, rocking, either pop-viable or downright jamming, tightly-written and exuberantly crafted tunes on this album, starting with the eponymous ""Winds of Change.""  A CLASSIC song.  Everybody I've played it for loves it (though it got zero play on radio), and Gracie Slick's voice never sounded better, or more powerful and lambent.  This is quite simply, a progressive-rock masterpiece that builds to a climactic crescendo of guitars and Gracie's ""take no prisoners"" clarion vocal chords.  Next is ""Keep on Dreamin,"" a very minor hit single for Starship.  This is a great pop ditty, not in the same class as ""Winds...,"" by any stretch of the imagination, but a decent enough song in its own right.  Short, sweet, and suitable either for AOR or hit radio.  It possesses an infectious quality about it which ends up making it irresistibly hummable!  Okay - fast forward to ""Out of Control.""  Like its title says, this song is an orgiastic romp with Gracie sounding like she's been dipping into the ""magic mushroom fondue"" again.  But it's a GREAT song, regardless - experimental and bold; brash and hard driving; rocking and contagious.  Certainly a unique creative departure, and welcome addition to, Starship's collection, and an almost entirely forgotten work of mad genius to this day.  The rest of the GOODIES follow in quick succession.  ""Can't Find Love"" is a progressive-rock gold nugget.  I *LOVE* Craig Chaquico's guitars on this album, especially on songs like this one.  His distortion level is ""Goldilocks"" - JUST RIGHT!  And the engineers didn't bury his axe in the mix.  You almost never think of Airplane, let alone Starship, as a ""heavy metal"" band, but this album (perhaps the reason why it went so underplayed), proves the group CAN JAM, and they do it here all over the place.  Next up, my ABSOLUTE FAVE when I received this album as an LP for Christmas in 1982:  ""Black Widow.""  With Craig's guitars going ALL OUT on this rock classic, and with Gracie's voice so clear and so seductive - by jiminey - you just want to ""climb into her web"" with her (as the dominatrix, deadly spider) while she's inviting the listener (you!) to do just that in her lyrics.  A combination of staccato, stop-time, heavy-amped guitar riffs (think Canadian power trio Rush during their best ""metallurgical"" work of the 70s), softened by rich refrain, full-out group harmonies, laced with Gracie's interspersed verse lines:  all come-hither ""take it sucker"" vocals that conjure images of the star dressed in a Corinthian-leather, black-and-red teddy, one leg kneeling on a bed, the other planted firmly on the floor in stilletoed high-heel, with a greased cat-o-nine-tails clenched in her fist, whose wrist is wrapped in a platinum bracelet beset with steel spikes!  ""Take it, Sucker"" INDEED!  Would that more radio stations had, because ""Black Widow"" is as good as anything by Rush, Blue Oyster Cult, Kansas or Angel, only with a female lead vocal.  This is arguably the BEST song on this album, or TIED for best with ""Winds of Change.""  Finally, ""I Came Back From the Jaws of the Dragon"" hearkens us to ""Red Octopus"" days and the very best of those, with its ""Play on Love"" feel and ""group chant"" ethos.  This song also rocks and once again, features Gracie Slick in superb form.  In fact, one can easily argue that ""Winds of Change"" IS Gracie's album, with Craig bringing out the powerful beauty, the best AND the BEAST in her.  To wrap this review up, ANY rock-and-roll album, and I mean ANY, that has 6 out of 9 great, listenable, well-written songs and superb production value to boot - DESERVES a place in ANY rock fan's collection.  If this is the first time you ever heard of ""Winds of Change"" by Jefferson Starship, you may be forgiven.  But to ignore this review and thereby to bypass this album is a mistake you render at your audial peril.  Get this album now!  It will be nigh IMPOSSIBLE, with 6 of 9 stellar rock pieces, and arguably some of Gracie's FINEST work, and arguably some of Craig's BEST of his best work on display as well - for you to NOT listen raptly and intently, with headphones tightly (but comfortably) enconsced over your ""salivating ear drums"" (talk about a mixed metaphor there), imagining that you're in a fast sports convertible (passenger seat preferred), top down, riding fast with the wind in your hair and lightning coming up over the horizon on a thunderclouded midwest plain, jamming to ""The Winds of Change.""",5,"07 17, 2006",There are 6 Out of 9 Awesome Songs on This Album!,1153094400,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},10.0,,crescendo intently lambent harmony significantly power invite posse i've star dress bury turnaround bypass driving come understand ever powerful slick heard fondue last progressive-rock thereby book get follow forgotten rock-and-roll full-out certainly orgiastic absolute make ear cat-o-nine-tails goldilocks steel song copy ability provide fortunately firmly verse odyssey starship's enconsced suitable prof chaquico's entirely midwest right horizon reduce let corinthian-leather airplane well-written rock craig's one-to-two almost zero find highly heavy-amped imagination tie would metal rush imagine finally welcome become hit band receive easily quest prisoner difficult experience aor either third-party superb axe staccato jefferson mean convertible beleaguer rid happens w.o.c deserved/deserves pristine credit may departure beset review chant mistake mixed lyric stellar slick's hard female jiminey black bold radio rock riff like purchasable vocal value level could usually airplay tightly-written listen title intersperse can't group gracie experimental within wait headphone clench craft unique obtain nugget genius well floor minor underrate octopus one love new whatever list fave sucker hooray sweet day passenger amazon first requiring soften line tightly time wind history top conjure dvd cd also tank talk decent voice see brilliant dreamin forth fist plain secure listener rich business-day christmas album classic engineer hearkens though include wind refrain underplayed impossible bracelet hummable heavy ignore piece personal clear rather high-heel gold j.s.'s vocal play audial build magic week metaphor work jam price contagious jam red dude creation mission hour romp spider starship trio comfortably bummmer writes raptly song simply need regardless jaws think independent thunderclouded gracie's next least spank anyone poor marketing eponymous enough tell secret change take wrapped render mean whose ethos go goody rock irresistibly music brand dragon forgiven metallurgical preferred image distortion quality back place argue buyer dominatrix good single fine quick use nigh mad plant whether climactic alone platinum outfit perhaps black-and-red get deadly sometimes check end sport stilletoed indeed form fast art keep masterpiece vendor i'm lightning cult gem best combination work widow beauty come-hither come typical look sound craig well wrist angel boot control kneel drum seductive via infectious pop find quite way remain arguably teddy dip ordered news stop-time rightfully everybody wrap seminal listenable ditty beast addition canadian great creative deserves feel stretch masterwork premier tune amazon's clarion fact website play spike medium delivery elusive pop-viable currently bring source hair reason oyster go kansa probably tell lp collection station sound copy cannot want display downright salivate love climb especially album succession fantastic blue item exuberantly bed accessible guitar production even book yippee else rest day lead mix fan's guitar forward outlets chord regret seat never com class short say brash total okay leg peril web available cd mushroom start anything laced keep grease feature

If you sell millions and go platinum with an album like 'Come On Over', what are you supposed to do next? Use exactly the same formula. So no matter what people say that ''UP'' is a precise copy of 'Come On Over', ''UP'' is the further new step of ''Come On Over''. You can feel Shania's uniqueness in her lyrics and in her amazing voice. The energy she has, is unstoppable. With two cd'S (one mixed with pop-rock and the other's mixed with country), ''UP'' is definitely the best release of 2002 (check out the charts, it is still number 1). I agree that ''UP'' does not feature any song like ''You are still the one'' and ''from this moment on'' but hey what about the brilliant ''When You Kiss Me'', awesome''I Ain't Going Down'', sweet''Juanita'' and the magnificant ''Forever and Always''? They can easily be the new ''You are still The One'' or ''From This Moment On'' (highly capture the quality of them). The opening intro track ''UP''is one of the best efforts of the album. With its lovely lyrics and the catchy vibe, it gives the signal of the great quality of the whole cd.''I'm Gonna Getcha Good'' is a semi-follower of ''That Don'T Impress Me Much'' with better lyrics and a great melody. ''It Only Hurts When I am Breathing'' is lyrically the best of the album with ''I Ain't Goin' Down''. ''Nah!'' is a cool track (both country and pop-rock versions) that make you up and dance whereas ''Waiter! Bring Me Water'' is a suprisingly impressive one that gets in your blood from the first time you hear it. Actually I don't have a fave Cd cuz both of them simply rules. You can listen country mixed (green) one in your bad and in a lovely Sunday whereas pop-rock mixed one is always ready to get you in a party mood. It is very clear to see that with every new record , Shania is taking herself one step further both lyrically and melodically. One big thing about her that she WRITES HER OWN STUFF and she CAN SING unlike many artists today. This is what I call, TALENT and Shania has truly blessed with TALENT.

2698,712558,A2TX79GR278JMA,B000V9KE38,P. Opus,False,"Like most fans of Marc Cohn, I discovered his work through his first album and the song ""Walking In Memphis.""  His earlier work tends to get pigeonholed in the ""adult contemporary"" category, much like that of his fellow piano-popster Bruce Hornsby.  However, also similar to Bruce Hornsby, Marc Cohn's music has always possessed much greater depth and weight than others who have been played on the same radio stations.  Like many people, I had pretty much forgotten about Marc Cohn after the 1990s.  Then I happened to hear ""Walking In Memphis"" performed on The Voice (I don't actually like the show but I had the good fortune to catch this song) and as a result I looked up Marc Cohn on amazon to see if he had recorded anything lately.  Which led me to this great album.  I like this one better than any of Cohn's past work.  Cohn smartly stripped away the (over)production found on his past work to give the album a grittier, more immediate feel.  Cohn also plays up the soulfulness of his sound, bringing forward the gospel aspects of the music through his vocal approach and the use of backup singers.  The excellent hurricane Katrina ballad ""Dance Back From The Grave"" has a Tom Waitsy feel to it, sounding simultaneously otherworldly and redemptive.  ""Listening to Levon"" draws its influence from its namesake (The Band), and ""If I Were An Angel"" is a classic soul number.  For me it all gels best on ""Live Out The String,"" a song about Cohn's recovery from a tragic carjacking incident.  It's a joyful song that celebrates being given the chance to live after a near-death experience.  Ultimately the songs are all of a piece and the album as a whole is a powerful experience.  I never found Cohn's earlier albums to have this kind of thematic coherence.  I cannot recommend an album more highly than this one.  Unfortunately I imagine it doesn't fit neatly into any genre category, so it's likely to get overlooked.

Despite earlier comments to the contrary, the 39-year old Leontyne Price is still very much in her prime here and does some really terrific singing and acting.  Carlo Bergonzi is an excellent Riccardo, full of lightness and elegance and humor.  Reri Grist is the perfect page, in lovely voice with flawless high notes.  The always wonderful  Shirley Verrett, though a mezzo, sings the contralto role of Ulrica with firm tones and excellent musicianship.  There was a comment that Robert Merrill was past his prime here.  I can tell you that he is in better voice for this recording than he was for the Traviata he made with Joan Sutherland in 1962.  I was amazed at just how good he sounded and what an all around fine job he did.  I also own the Ballo with Pavarotti and Margaret Price, et al.

It was in college that a friend introduced me to ""Strength of My Life"" as a praise chorus.  I immediately fell in love with the heartfelt cry of dependence on God.  Almost immediately, I discovered a cover of her song ""By My Spirit.""  This song's promise from God of help and encouragement in life's trials also struck a chord with me.  Even so, it was years later before I tracked down any more of Leslie's music. When I finally decided to get this CD, I immediately fell in love with it.  It covers a range from the upbeat fun of ""No One But You"" and ""Love is Not Lost"" to the more contemplative ""Answers Don't Come Easy"" and the encouraging ""Your Kindness.""  It also includes the originals of the two songs I mentioned above, including the ""real"" verses to ""Strength of My Life.""  (Turns out what I thought were verses are part of the chorus.) What I love most about all the lyrics on this CD is their honesty.  They range from knowing God and His promises to the doubt that comes when we face trials.  But everything is explored in an unflinching manner that makes sense even if it doesn't fall back on the pat answers that Christians sometimes rely on too much. Unfortunately, the albums this CD came from are long out of print.

2712,756268,A5V9ZO86T8NJA,B0012E6R3M,Andrew Tatusko,False,"Meshuggah's previous two albums focused on the truly esoteric and avant garde. Where they had generated a new genre of music that came to be known as ""math-metal"" due to their use of complex and often indecipherable poly-rhythms primarily in Chaosphere in 1998, I, and then followed by 2006's Catch 33 took that from to a new level. The former presented a couple of tracks combined into tone long one. The latter took about 6 tracks and arbitrarily cut them up into 13. For Limewire music stealers, this had to be frustrating!  On obZen they go back to the form on Chaosphere, in terms of overall accessibility. However, they stay true to what they have done since then offering a mature sound. It is as if they have found their identity and are now presenting it to us in about as brutally cataclysmic form as they can muster. The music is simply mesmerizing. I am offering a track that I cannot stop playing. It is one of the more aggressive tracks on the album and clocks in at over 7 minutes.  Listen to the Allan Holdsworth-like chromaticism on the lead guitar lines (at about the 3:40 mark and then some). The eight string guitars combined with the dirty fuzzy bass and Tomas Haake's perfect sounding Sonors (I play Sonors so I am a bit biased) are impeccably produced.

2713,254775,A3AEVRZDPY7T0O,B000002VPI,caramel,False,"""Sometimes you'll laugh and sometimes you will cry, life never tells us the whens or why's, but when you've got friends to wish you well.. You'll find the point that you will exhale, Shoop Shoop.  This amazing soundtrack which featured some of the greatest female R&B singers of the 90's showcases the raw powerful talent of not only the female artists, but the man who wrote, produced, and arranged most of the songs of the soundtack, Babyface. I recommend this album to anyone who has seen the movie or if you love R&B music that this is an album that has to be included in your music collection. Let's begin with the first song, which brings forth the passion and power of the soundtrack  1)Exhale (Shoop Shoop)- Strong opening for the song. Ms. Houstons vocals were strong. The lyrics wonderful as they portrayed the emotional drama that occured during the movie  2)Why does it hurt so bad?- Wonder why some of us are still in love with someone who has hurt us so bad. Well Babyface and Whitney want to tell you and they do so brillantly. This incredible song demonstrates why Ms. Houston is one of our greatest singers of all time.  3)Let it flow- Have Toni Braxtons Secrets album, then you alredy know about this song. Now Say lalalalala  4)Hurts Like Hell- Bow down to the Queen of Soul, Ms. Franklin. This was probably one of the best songs of the album. Ms. Franklin talks about the hurt we all go through when love turns sour and how the survivial hurts like hell  5)Sitt'in in my room- At the time Brandy the soundtrack was released. Brandy was one of the youngest newcomers of the R&B scene. Although initially, I wanted Aaliyah to be on the soundtrack and wondered why she was not there, Brandy did a great job with the song, it brought a youthful approach about love and romance.  6)This is how it works- This before the fan mail CD was probabaly TLC's most provocative song out there. If your listening at work make sure to keep it at low volume.  7) Not Gon'Cry- This song totally fits the character of Angela Basset from the movie and for any woman who has been betrayed by her lover, friend, and or husband. Known to all of us, as the Queen of Hip Hop and Soul Babyface really knew what song to give Mary J. Blige and this song really showcases Mary's ability to do a variety of R&B styles not just with songs that have a Hip Hop edge to them  8)My Funny Valentine- Yes a remake of this incredible song, it can only be done by a great singer and Chaka Khan the legend that she is outdid herself immensely. Her voice was so sultry, and inviting that the song really gets you in the mood for umm some long loving....  9)And I Gave My Love to You- When I hear this song I think of soul, hip hop,and poetry.  10)All Night Long- Great song to seduce your man into getting him into the mood.  11)Wey U- Even though I did not understand the lyrics. Chante Moores voice is so great that you overlook it  12)My Love, Sweet Love- Ms. Labelle is not going to let these other girls get all the attention with this sweet song. Yes, she is going to sing nice and slow, but towards the end she is going to give us a wave of emotion which only Patti can give.  13)Kissing You- One of my favorite songs from Faith Evans. Ms. Evans at this time had just barely entered the R&B scene and Babyface knew what song to give to her really push her out to mainstream.  14)Love will be waiting at home- The last songs of the soundtrack show a variety of artists who were not really known in the music scene. For Real was an incredible R&B group that showcased great singer but sadly did not make it to mainstream  15)How could you call her baby- Want to win an agrument with your man if he is cheating. Play this song.  16)Count on Me- What do you when you feature the greatest singer of our time (Ms. Houston) and match her with one of the greatest Gospel vocalists of our time (Ms. Winans).

It is common for a band to tour and tour and tour, perfect a batch of songs, release it on a spectacular debut, and then run out of ideas and have to face the ""sophomore slump."" With Aerosmith, however, the band didn't really get its groove until their third album ""Toys in the Attic."" Aerosmith's 1973 self-titled debut and its follow-up ""Get your Wings"" (1974) are good solid albums, but seem rather tepid and underwhelming when compared to the band's mid 70s prime material. While the self-titled debut contains the classics ""Dream On"" and ""Mamma Kin,"" the rest of the album isn't up-to-par. That's not to say that the self-titled debut only has two good songs and a bunch of filler; as the rest of the album is good, it's just that it doesn't compare with the band's later material. With the self-titled debut Aerosmith found their signature, it's just that the band's writing hadn't yet reached its peak. While the opening ""Make it"" and the classic balled ""Dream On"" and the rocking ""Mamma Kin"" stand as some of the band's best work, the rest of the album is just good, but not great.  If you are an Aerosmith fan, by all means, get this album. If you are new to Aerosmith, however, start off with ""Toys in the Attic"" and ""Rocks"" before buying the debut.",3,"01 24, 2006",Off to a good start,1138060800,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},2.0,,joe halen drum sophomore hard self-titled attic much groove rock work mamma vocal however toy song steven write perfect whitford get follow-up perry open buy great solid reach third later mean groove bass contain notably find rock tour star idea really debut that's kramer face new possible toxic compare hamilton material compare exception good slump rock van up-to-par prime produce brad album common dream underwhelming mid batch peak fan tom joey start boogie classic band rest filler release guitar make aerosmith album best band's two signature often yet classic along kiss spectacular tepid run seem ball bunch wing kin twin tyler blues-based aerosmith's synonymous say rather stand

This is nothing like many of their American tech-death counterparts who seem to focus on form over substance (i.e. playing terrible music really, really fast). Nearly every riff is immediately recognizable as music (shocking!), but still extremely technical. For this reason (and the many classical interludes), many people are aptly describing this band as having heavy classical influence. Another thing worthy of note: many of the songs seem to flow right into one another as would a classical symphony if it were comprised of ten movements played by some very angry people. Even in the context of music theory, these songs are closer to a classical style of composition as opposed to the more typical ""metal"" approach.

Although Blaze is not the best vocalist around, he and the other band-members know how to write excellent songs. Fortunately Blaze only sings in his vocal range and he has also written excellent lyrics (it is a concept album) and vocal melodies. On this album Blaze delivers his best vocal efforts by far.  I would describe the Tenth Dimension as a classic Heavy Metal album without al the clichs of the genre. I really like the heavy guitars and pounding drums. The overall production is also well done. There is a dark mood on the album and therefore the mood can be best compared with Iron Maiden's album X-Factor. Although the album is varied, the songs are mostly mid-tempo. One of the most interesting songs is the song ""Meant To Be."" It is a slow epic song with some female operatic vocals. There are also some fast and energetic songs like ""Leap Of Faith"" and ""Speed Of Light"". Although I am not very fond of new Traditional Metal releases, I really like the Tenth Dimension.  I really recommend you to purchase the limited edition. It features a bonus disk with one unreleased track, 4 live tracks, 2 mp3 tracks from Blaze's first album Silicon Messiah, a video clip from the song ""Ghost In The Machine"" and the making of the Tenth Dimension.

I'm new to the world of Rodney so I cannot really compare this DVD to anything he's done in the past but now I am a new fan.  The songs are the most entertaining part of his show and, if you don't listen to the lyrics too closely, you'd swear you was watching a George Strait acoustic show.  By that I mean the guy can actually carry a tune - the comedy is not in his bad singing but in the lyrics.  The way he sings with funny facial expressions is hillarious and his piano player sideman getting into the act as well by going off on tangents singing until Rodney stops him.  I am not easily offended at all so if you are, this guy is not for you.  Funny is funny, if you can't handle profanity or sexual references then you should probably stick to something like Bill Cosby.  Otherwise, this DVD is well worth buying and it makes you wonder how far Rodney would get if he actually turned into a serious singer(which in the bonus materials on the DVD, he says he has no intention of doing).  The bonus feature is entertaining too.  You get to see Rodney meet the fans, hang out backstage and hear a few new songs not on the stand-up show including a 'serious' song he wrote about a friend of his who passed away.

They complain about their social circle on the expected jangly acoustic numbers and they complain some more on the unexpected 1950's girl group reverb drenched doo wop numbers, and they manage to convey the futile minor pains of their existences in several different genres, but they never manage to convey much joy.

What's that cliche about people who live in glass houses? I also noticed another reviewer mention (as praise) that these are some of the best songs Petula Clark never wrote. Well, how many Petula Clark albums do you own? If your answer is ""all of them,"" then perhaps you'd find this interesting. Really, there's not much original here at all.

But time passed, and right on time as I do every couple of years, I got that itch that can only be scratched by digging out all of my Metallica and listening to it in chronological order. When I got to Death Magnetic, I remembered ""Oh god... after this they did that Lou Reed album. Eh, what else am I going to blow money on this week?"" I bit the bullet and here I am.  Metallica- imagine that once per year or so, Metallica goes into a recording studio to just get together and jam and come up with some riffs that might be suitable for being crafted into an actual song someday. Imagine that out of those sessions, 90% of it is just worthless drivel; overly simplistic repetitive riffs that go on for several minutes too long, until the band realizes that nothing interesting is happening and finally abandons it. That's exactly what most of this stuff sounds like, a bunch of aimless throw-away jams.  Lou Reed- He's a self-parody on this album. I already have an aversion to poetry* and this album didn't help. Quite the opposite in fact. Some of this crap was literally embarrassing to listen to. Pretty sure I actually blushed a couple of times. I'm not very familiar with much of his post-VU stuff, certainly nothing from the last 20 years. But I'd be shocked if it was as bad as this.  This is another one for the ""Metallica is trying to out-Spinal-Tap Spinal Tap"" file. I can just imagine everyone in the studio while this album was being made, Cliff Burnstein standing in the middle of the room, enthusiastically bobbing his head to a rhythm that nobody else can hear. I'd rather listen to S&M again than this. But I'd rather get paper cuts between all of my fingers and toes than listen to S&M again. I might make an exception for one song, Junior Dad. The music was dominated by what sounded like some kind of droning melodica, or an accordion or bagpipes or something, and Reed's babbling was kept to a minimum. It kinda reminded me of Jesu. It went on for almost 20 minutes, but it never made me wish I was deaf, which I can't say for most of the other songs.

As a supporting act, I did not have much expectation as to being impressed with what was to come. However, I was pleasantly surprised with what I heard: music and accents all. I was not initially taken by the band, but had the opportunity to shake hands with them and thank them for an excellent set and left the evening experience with The Twilight Sad at that. Only upon hearing praise upon praise for this newest effort--especially from other bands and artists I greatly admire--did I return to their sounds and find myself pleased with what I found.  This album is nothing new from any spectrum, mind you. There are familiar instruments and familiar sounds combining forces for something grand. That alone is what does set them apart, though. There is a lot of musical drivel out there that meanders into obscurity, but this stuff sticks with you. The music is bold and delightful with rich guitar work and lush synth grooves. Neither overpowers the other. Rather, each provides the right amount of support for the other to stand its ground. It all ranges from soothing ambience to unsettling, brooding meshing of dark synth and distorted guitar (again, richly presented).  The music is delightful and could take you through the record on its own. However, the icing comes in the form of James Graham's vocals. I love accents, and I feel that they are missing far too often from contemporary music. To hear such a strong and confident Scottish vocal enhancement is a welcome experience. With Graham singing his words, The Twilight Sad become complete.  There is good reason this album has been receiving such high praise. These musicians know what they are doing and are happy to wrap it all up to present it to us with their own Glasgow flair.

2783,1368566,A3R2F08B9Z6GHX,B002MED6BW,Jeffrey Rubard,False,"The genealogy of rock is a difficult business. Some acts, like the Rolling Stones, established an idiom which is powerful and easy to imitate: consequently, we hear their influence everywhere, so much so that we hardly need to call something ""Stonesy"". However, one of the somewhat hidden influences on some of the most ""left-of-center"" American music of the last 40 years is more difficult to pronounce upon, partially because the ""image"" of the band goes against what indie stands for in the minds of listeners. I refer, though it is not an ""of course"", to none other than the Beach Boys. Products of a Southern California ""sundown town"", micromanaged by their father in a career that began with cheesy rip-offs of Chuck Berry and went on to theme songs for Republican presidential candidates, we might well doubt that Brian Wilson and co. could have had a salutary effect on any iconoclastic musicians.  And yet so many clever but inward-looking indie auteurs could not be without this source material of beautiful harmonies and emotional turmoil. Pere Ubu's David Thomas has been unabashed in citing the Beach Boys as a major inspiration for his ""avant-garage"". In a younger generation Bradford Cox (leader of Atlanta's Deerhunter) with his eclectic side-project music released under the name ""Atlas Sound"" is clearly deriving much from *Pet Sounds* and other high points of the Wilsonian oeuvre. *Logos*, the second of three Atlas Sound releases to date, fully lives up to the compositional brilliance of the Beach Boys: songs like ""Walkabout"" take modern electronic technology and make the 'orchestrated pop' concept work for it. Though Cox can be somewhat uneven, I think it says something when one of the weaker tracks on an album features Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier, and so it is here.

The main riff of ""Take A Friend"" is a blatant ripoff of ""Whole Lotta Love,"" for example. Although the album bristles with energy, Geddy Lee just wasn't quite the lyricist that Neil Peart is (to be fair, Ged did write a few later Rush tunes, and the lyrics of My Favorite Headache aren't too bad).  And John Rutsey's drumming is only slightly more creative than Phil Rudd's.  And this album has the most unpretty cover of anything Rush ever did. But, hey, it's got ""Working Man.""

2790,799890,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B001L1C45G,Distant Voyageur,False,"Released in 1971 with Genesis taking up it's beloved classic line-up, Nursery Cryme is the album where Phil Collins first showcased his talent both on the drums and is also where Collins took lead vocals for the first time, not on Selling England By The Pound. The production of this CD is absolutely atrocious but the remastering does help Nursery Cryme a lot and sounds vastly superior to the older version. I must say that the album front cover sleeve with the striped field and the nurse playing tee ball, showcases the schizophrenic and psychotic mood of the LP. 1971 was one of the years of the golden era of prog-rock and Genesis were among the top bands of that style of rock and there's plenty of it on Nursery Cryme. Genesis in fact, never abandoned their prog-rock roots, even with their heavily polished, squeaky clean production of their 1983 self-titled debut and Invisible Touch as well as We Can't Dance and even Calling All Stations. There is no radio-friendly material on here but what there is is 7 tracks of sheer beauty with bizarre production with some of the strangest lyrics that Peter Gabriel has ever written. I might come into confrontations with those purists who can't seem to like any of the LPs Phil Collins at lead vocals, however, even I sometimes think about where Genesis would've gone if Steve Hackett had stayed but nonetheless, Genesis were among the most consistent bands of all time. Return of The Giant Hogweeds is a standout cut. I just love the buzzing guitar chord changes in the beginning of it and its menacing musicianship and Gabriels fierce storytelling vocals and it truly showcases its theme. Its an epic tale of giant plants that escapes from captivity to wreak terrible revenge on the human race and the guitars and organs are amazing! The other standout cut is For Absent Friends as its where Phil Collins for the first time in his career, sings on lead vocals. While his voice was a bit mousey at that point, the song is a beautiful, simple, & acoustic ballad. The only thing that keeps this track from being great is that its less than two minutes long! As much as this CD is great, I must honestly admit that the muddy production as well as it's short playing time of only 39 minutes does keep this from being an essential recording like Genesis latter material compared with Foxtrot or Selling England By The Pound. For the fan base whose tastes are mostly confined to the Phil Collins-era LPs, Nursery Cryme may not be an easy album to get into easily, even for those who loved Wind & Wuthering or Trick Of The Tail but even for those ppl, I do recommend trying NC for something different as Genesis are like a chameleon band. Despite all the cons, Nursery Cryme is a wonderful record that is one worthy of checking out even if it turns out not being all that appreciating. Sure it may not have gotten noticed at the time of its release but guess what, its still in print after 31 years! An enduring classic that is not quite an essential but definitely one worthy of checking out.

2803,213890,A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B000002L99,Tnahpellee,False,"David Lee Roth was gone for the album (Duh!, you already knew that) and Sammy Hagar was in. Although most people decry the vocalist change, it actually worked. Hagar is something of a chameleon; he's able to adapt to newer styles and era's without feeling as though he's selling out. And, hey, he was the same sought of sleazebag womaniser that the last guy was, that's gotta count for something! And what could be better than replacing one super-confident sleazebag with long blonde hair with another super-confident sleazebag with long blonde hair? Man! That almost sounds like a good idea... And hey, he'd been around since 1973 with Montrose, so he brings a lot of experience to the table, experience is a good thing, right? Well, usually. Though sometimes... like if you have 40 years experience under your belt, (literally?) well, you know... you must be kinda old...  Anyway, Hagar wasn't that old when he took over Van Halen, and for all the people saying that David should have stayed in the band, well, his star shone bright in 1986 with the extremely successful Eat Em and Smile, but his album sales soon fell away. Hagar was able to keep the Van Halen brand selling platinum right through to the mid-90's. SO There! But all that matters is the music right? Right! Well...  Hagar takes on the personality of rebel womanising sleazebag and plays it perfectly, but he tweaks it a bit, not too much, but a bit. He throws in some sanctimonious sap and some tear-jerking for good measure? Or is it bad measure? Well Van Halen had always avoided ballads, but actually the best songs on this album ARE the ballads.  Sure rockers like 'Get Up' and 'Can't get enough' are ok, but I mean they are quite mediocre. 'Summer Nights' is more fun and 'Best of both worlds' (A tranny anthem?) has a great groove (actually, it's kind of a rip off... I think the ole' disco tune by Kool and the Gang, Celebrate good times or something like.... YES! Van Halen ripped off a disco song). Man it's hard not to sing along to that infectious chorus, man I caught the bug or something... Then the title track is Hagar complaining about his girlfriend or wife or something, and it's not a lot of fun. But the ballads, well, you can call 'Why can't this be love' a ballad, it's not really, but, it's emotionally powerful, with a simple yet effective message 'it's got what it takes, so tell me Why Can't This Be Love?' and 'Dreams' is a mega power ballad, a beautiful intro with acoustic guitar playing along to some nice synths, and that powerful chorus with Sammy shrieking like a coyote 'Higher and Higher'; veyr uplifting song. And then my favourite song on the album 'Love walks in' which is sought of ethereal and fuses romantic lyrics with a UFO theme. Exquisite melody and a wonderful feeling in this song.

Songs like ""The Devil, The Sinner, And His Journey"" and ""Slottet I Det Fjerne"" are pure pieces of nuclear speed chaos (though not as fast as Mayhem), and ""Destroyer"" and ""Pa Slagmark Langt Mod Nordt"" are pure demonic mayhem, as if the demons of hell are speaking through your speakers.  It is no surprise, then, that those two are my favorites on this album.  And by the way, Telnes, Tiegs, and Kronenes are Tormentor, Infernus, and Pest.

2807,290485,A18AYRYL1TY8VP,B00000411N,LuelCanyon,True,"I so agree with the last reviewer!  As to another reviewer's dissertation on what constitues a ""Mozart singer"", hogwash!  Montserrat Caballe failing to understand at every moment that she is singing Mozart?  Hogwash!  A 'Mozart singer' is like every other 'singer' - you got it or you ain't; the rest is intellectual preening and has nothing to do with genuine operatic art. And what singing this is - a Cosi to treasure!  Mozart's ensemble writing in this opera surpasses that of his other operas, and Baker, Cotrubas and Caballe find an emotional perfection in the rendering that alters the earth's orbit!  I've not heard another Cosi like it since Cotrubas' earlier recording with von Stade and Stratas.  I also have the Harmonia Mundi recording and find it mundane by comparison.  Veronique Gens has fioriture up her sleeve; she can pull it out, but she sings with the emotional depth of a teenager.  Hers is a vocal aesthetic for Lully or Rameau, but not Bach, and certainly Mozart suggests that more consolidation of resources is necessary.  Why not hire David Bowie for the role?  -might as well.  What is more 'stylish' than the musicianship these peerless singers and musicians bring to this surpassing Cosi?  Please not Rene Jacobs' arcane treatment of the score, though I do admire the Cologne orchestra, particularly the weight of the strings, but that too cerebral 'informed classicism' always sticks its little notebook up into the musical air.  Colin Davis rivals his own Tosca (also with Caballe) in this recording.  The Covent Garden forces shine under his watch, even more, they consistently reach into themselves and deep into Mozart, deep into the opera - an attribute I would not ordinarily ascribe to this opera orchestra and chorus.  Nicolai Gedda will probably die still insufficiently revered, he is one of the supreme artists of our time, or any time; he is as desirable an actor as he is miraculous singer.  Even now, as things fall apart, he remains the present heart of any opera ensemble.  His artistry burnishes this recording to a glow.

The songs are all great, but ""New York State of Mind"" hasn't received its proper due from the standpoint of sonics or consistency.  ""Turnstiles"" was released on CD in 1986 (Columbia, CK 33848).  This initial CD release has very clean sound - given the CD technology available at that time - except on ""New York State of Mind.""  It suffers on this CD release from loud hiss, especially in the piano introduction.  This hiss is not as apparent on the CD's other seven tracks.  The original ""Turnstiles"" release of ""New York State of Mind"" appeared with much cleaner sound on the vinyl and cassette releases of ""Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volumes I and II,"" issued by Columbia in 1985.  The CD release of ""Greatest Hits Volumes I and II"", however, features a slightly different version of ""New York State of Mind.""  It has almost no background noise, but DOES HAVE annoying reverb on Billy Joel's vocals.  It also has a VERY different saxophone track.  It is this latter butchery of ""New York State of Mind"" that is featured on the 1998 CD re-issue of ""Turnstiles.""

I'm sure many people had high, high hopes for ""The Blueprint 2.""  Fact of the matter is, it sounds like Jay-Z had high hopes for it too.  That is why he made his seventh studio album his first ever double disc record. Lyrically speaking, Jay-Z brings it as hard as he can on each song.  The only thing bringing this album down is the beats, or the ""samples"" Jay uses to ""make"" his beats.  Case in point: ""'03 Bonnie & Clyde.""  I HATE THIS SONG WITH A FIREY PASSION!  It's not that he uses the beat, it's that he uses the beat AND the chorus.  If you are gonna bite, bite in small pieces, not chunks.  It also isn't just the biting.  Producer Just Blaze gives Jay some incredibly weak and boring tracks to work with.  Most of Just Blaze's beats have been hot, up until now.  The Neptunes also disappoint on their 4 songs, which is surprising since they have been on a roll until this road block.  The only producer to live up to his hype is Timbaland, who cannot be stopped.  His beats are sick and no one in the game can touch him right now. Jay-Z also tries to come back at Nas on the title track.  After that disappointing freestyle over the ""Got Yourself A..."" beat, Jay has had over half a year to come back at Nas.  His so-called comeback at Nas, however, is incredibly soft.  I cannot wait to see what Nas will come back with.  You must think that no song on this album is good.  However, that isn't true.  There are about 10 - 12 good tracks, inlcuding the Lenny Kravitz duet ""Guns & Roses,"" ""Diamond is Forever,"" and ""The Watcher 2,"" with Dre, Truth Hurts and ""The God"" Rakim. Jay-Z could have had another ""4 - 4 1/2 mic"" album with ""The Blueprint 2,"" but too much filler and weak production means that Jay needs to go back to the drawing board for his next album.",3,"11 14, 2002",Should Have Been A Great Single Disc  Album,1037232000,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},,,freestyle track hard diamond clyde rakim much comeback work double like seventh ever bonnie dogg however true disc could songs come half think blaze's hot next title lenny soft follow-up sick passion lyrically high hope many thing hype wait jay-z sure roll timbaland gonna mean song must disappoint surprising na record god bring jay one fact touch beat stop back doggfather make beat right bite bring producer try point blueprint snoop live forever sounds good give dre kravitz gun first blaze bore bite cannot studio so-called hate draw album get mic truth track sample also game watcher speak inlcuding production weak see matter hurt filler duet road roses neptune make case need disappoint i'm since chorus incredibly block classic mediocre chunk board people go year firey another piece use small

Despite belonging to the nineties, the album sounds timeless, the production sparkles, there is absolutely no filler, & it harkens back to the day when albums were real albums  as in a cohesive piece of work where one song flows into the next without pandering to the audience in the fashion that todays singles-ridden record industry seems oft to do.  Tidal is exceptional for many reasons, and is perhaps the greatest debut by a female singer-songwriter in record history. The closest parallel that can be drawn is with Tori Amos debut record Little Earthquakes (although Toriphiles would argue that Toris actual first album was by her now defunct band Y Kant Tori Read). Nothing else comes remotely close. This album is immediately arresting due to its decision to put Apples jazz-influenced husky voice up front and center, rather than drowning it down with instrumentation. Considering the time period it came from, this is remarkable (try listening to some of those Sophie B. Hawkins & Heather Nova albums and youll know exactly what I mean).  Even more interesting, the best songs on this piece of art are the ones that were not singles. Criminal, for which it is best known, is a grand statement even all these years later, but check out the subdued production of Carrion, and also the subtle flourishes in Pale September. They work as the album closers but they are exceptional & possibly the best things on the record, followed quite obviously by The First Taste, which is still haunting in this day and age; the lyrics are something Fiona herself has been unable to surpass, despite of course their tendency to veer into dramatics & over the top imagery. That though is part of the magic, and I for one embrace Apples attempts at poetic genius rather than deride them.  Fionas next album When the Pawn was equally grandiose, albeit with more of an alternative rock edge, and her later albums Extraordinary Machine, and 2012s The Idler Wheel are all naturally fantastic, but there is *something* about Tidal that is unforgettable. Definitely a desert island disc in my opinion, and one that every serious record collector should own properly on CD or vinyl. On a side note the production values on this disc are nothing short of overwhelmingly good. Tidal is on my Top 10 list of the Greatest Albums of All Time, a list that also contains Tori Amos Scarlets Walk, Joanna Newsoms Ys, & Cocorosies Gray Oceans.

2849,138568,A1X1S1TUPEYVL,B000002G1T,J. Chasin,False,"Some records catch magic like lightning in a bottle.  There is a mood, a vibe to the album that goes beyond simply musicians gathering in a studio to record a bunch of songs.  The Cowboy Junkies Trinity Sessions is one such album.  Tuesday Night Music Club is another.  And 12 years after its release, Crow is a big star and this remains her best, quintessential record.  If you see her live, these are still the songs that pull the most applause.  What makes this record so special?  A clue lies buried in the title.  Every Tuesday for about a year, Crow and a group of LA musicians-- notably including the late Kevin Gilbert, who was instrumental here, as well as David Baerwald-- would gather and play music and record.  At some point this activity got directed into the making of Crow's debut.  Indeed the process of making TNMC was more of a group effort than a solo one; Crow has the strongest supporting cast here she has ever had, before or since.  You will see below one reviewer state that this record is not representative of Crow's later work, and that is probably true; you will see another reviewer give much of the credit to Gilbert, and that too is probably fair (although make no mistake, this is a Sheryl Crow record).  But the bottom line is that a confluence of factors-- Crow's undeniable talents and taste, the mix of the players, the loose communal vibe, Gilbert's influence and pop songcraft-- combined to make a special record.  If it is not representative of her later work, I would think that would be because the later work is generally not as strong.  ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" ""Strong Enough,"" ""Can't Cry Anymore,"" and ""I Shall Believe"" remain among her best, and best-loved, songs.  ""All I Wanna Do"" gets a bum rap because it was so ubiquitous during the summer of 1994; but when I bought this album for the first time in 1993, that track was so good and immediately likable that it made my personal ""Best of '93"" cassette.  Crow said of these sessions that they were loose and collaberative; someone might have been given a writing credit if they'd brought a joint that night. I think her subsequent records, while all having a few standout tracks, are not as consistent or cogent as a whole as this one.  I do agree that if you like this record you might be disappointed in the two that followed; lord knows I was.

And the brothers are unfortunately another one of those bands that want to take their career in a different direction than their original label does, which results in going the indie route. I didn't like their first independent album Underneath very much, but thankfully things work out much better on The Walk.  Now that Isaac, Taylor and Zac are all over twenty and married with children, that might account for why their songs have more of an adult contemporary vibe than what was found on previous efforts. But one thing that's surprising about this album is that Zac actually does much of the lead singing on here, like on the title track as well as the three-in-a-row of ""Running Man"", ""Go"" and ""Fire on the Mountain"", and even though I heard him singing on ""Misery"" off their previous album, he sounds even better here. Isaac also impresses when he handles lead vocals on ""Watch Over Me"".  But Taylor still helps with his usual vocals, as evidenced by highlights like ""Georgia"", ""Been There Before"" and ""Something Going Round"". There are also some acoustic bonus tracks that suit me well, like ""I've Been Down"" and ""Got a Hold on Me"" (although the second acoustic version of ""Something Going Round"" is a little unnecessary).

I liked Dire Straits and all (the song, ""Brothers In Arms"" ranks very high on my all time favorite list) - but Knopfler's solo work has never resonated with me.  But seeing the two on a project together, there was no way not to purchase.  It's like pizza:  even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. And good it is.  `Roadrunning' has Knopfler's trademark guitar work and Harris' unmistakable vocals (actually Knopfler's too). After hearing the first part of the first (and very good) track, I was worried that it would be all-Knopfler w/backing vocals by Harris, but it's not the case.  Ok, sometimes it's the case - but sometimes it's the reverse. They definately compliment each other.  All of the songs Some of Harris' material (or the songs she has primary vocals) could have easily been on `Red Dirt Girl' or `Wrecking Ball' (""Rollin' On"" and ""Right Now""). ""Love and Happiness"" and ""Belle Starr"" is traditional Emmylou, and I think not only b/c Harris has writing credit on those songs.  There are mediocre points and I won't win any point with this, but these include ""This is Us"" and ""If This is Goodbye"".  I find myself wanting the two to harmonize more - but it seems to be co-melody singing throughout most of the disk.  For me, the absolute highlight is ""I Dug Up a Diamond"".

Chris Barnes to me is a great songwriter with great vocal range and on here you don't really get too many high shrieks like SFU. This was made when i was born,25 years ago. To this day it still remains one of my favorite along with Tomb&Bleeding. Barnes formed SFU and rewriting of Vile began(check for Barnes EP Created to Kill) but here are some great songs with churning fast guitars dueling.

Highsmith,False,"When I first heard Beanie Sigel on Rocafella classics, ""Crew Love"" w/Memphis Bleek & Jay Z and ""Reservoir Dogs"" w/Jay Z, Sauce Money & The LOX, I knew that he would have a future in the rap game.  His delivery and words are on another level.  He always dropped tight verses on songs that he was featured on and he had fans eagerly awaiting his debut CD, ""The Truth"".  When the CD came out, it featured his classic ""What A Thug About"", ""Who Want What"" w/Memphis Bleek, the title track and one of the darkest songs of 2000, ""What Ya Life Like"".  People that may have been sleeping on Beanie definitely woke up after listening to his solo CD.  Now fresh of his stellar performances on Jay Z's ""The Dynasty: Roc La Familia"" where he took tracks like ""This Must Be Life"", ""Where Have You Been"", and ""Change The Game"" to another level, Beanie Sigel is back less than a year and a half later with his 2nd disc, ""The Reason"".  As soon as the CD comes on, you are blessed with the Kanye West produced, ""Nothing Like It"", where Beanie sounds almost like a prophet of Philly telling folks that may not know about the Illadelph  how things go down.  The first single ""Beanie"" was definitely a good choice as Beanie Sigel takes the phrase from Snoop Dogg's ""Murder Was The Case""  to create a hook for this song.  The rest of the CD is on point as well, as Beanie gets a little help from The Roc, Freeway, Scarface, and Daz & Kurupt stop by to lend some assistance on the hooks of two songs.  Other songs to remember from this CD are the best song, in my opinion, ""Think It's A Game"" w/Jay Z, Freeway and Lil Chris, ""Mom's Prayer"" w/Scarface, the remake of the EPMD classic ""So What You Saying"" w/Memphis Bleek, ""I Don't Do Much"" and ""What Your Life Like 2"".

2868,700383,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000RG1FMO,Rocky Raccoon,True,"Kanye West is a genius.  Not only does he flow with a barbed wit, he is able to take a variety of forms to add to his hip-hop, rap base.  His latest C.D. `Graduation' picks up where `Late Registration' left off.  His theme demonstrates the difference between our dreams and life's disappointing realities.  Slicker than his last outing, Kanye's titles tell much of the story, but his lyrics nail the subject matter thoroughly.  Even the artwork tells his audience volumes.  Not as punchy as `Late Registration's ""Sierra Leone"" or ""Gold Digger,"" he manages to get ethereal for the opener ""Good Morning,"" ""I Wonder,"" and ""Flashing Lights"" which add formidable rap to the traditional pop mix.  His humor is in finest form on ""Barry Bonds,"" with a stinging anti-glamour rap that goes off in several directions but ends up at a certain destination.  There's resiliency added to the mix with ""Stronger"" which is only familiar for its clich refrain:  ""That that don't kill me, can only make me stronger.""  In my opinion, ""Champion,"" with its native rhythms and synthesizers is the most outstanding track.  Between sweet sounds, perceptively sharp lyrics, Kanye has finished his trilogy on a good note. ""Big Brother"" is both a celebration and a protest against the trappings that put him on top.  Even obtaining one's goals has its downside, too.

I appreciate music in all forms and various genres, but I thought this was fairly specific in its title.  I was surprised to find some songs that just didn't seem to fit.  I really didn't mind hearing them, but I think a good title list would be appropriate, so here goes:  1.  Lightning Strikes  by Lou Christie 2.  Every Day I Have to Cry  by Steve Alaimo 3.

If you are looking for any of these tunes, the quality of this cd is okay.  I noticed that on some of the songs, like ""Walk Away Renee"" the sound wasn't balanced in stereo.  This is such a rich recording in it's original form due to the use of strings along with the typical rock guitars and drums, that to have this song on a cd and not hear it as it was meant to be is a bit disappointing.

Even when performing other people's work, he has that uncanny ability to make the songs his own. But though I've always been among the legion of Merle Haggard fans, I never had an inkling that this ex-prisoner who made a career writing and performing honky tonkish and drinking songs is just as effective doing purely religious stuff. This compilation is quite an eye opener. His performance of traditional hymns such as How Great Thou Art, What A Friend We Have In Jesus, Old Rugged Cross, Where No One Stands Alone, Softly And Tenderly, etc. can stand up and hold their own against those of other artists who had tried recording religious hymns before him.

The real attraction to this album for so many (Eydie fans or otherwise) is the usual teaming of Eydie with Don Costa.  Costa's originality in his arrangements was always evident, no matter who he worked with.  None of these songs have the twang or the ""down home"" feeling like the originals; instead, Eydie and Don have updated them with smart, crisp arrangements and stylish singing.  (Ray Charles used the same formula on his country albums with similarly fantastic results)  Eydie's version of END OF THE WORLD is for grown up heartbreak, where the original smarted with a puppy love gone wrong feeling.  She takes the Johnny Cash classic I WALK THE LINE and rocks through it abetted by a hard driving arrangement. The real Gorme magic comes shining through with a great tag on the ending of NO ONE TO CRY TO.  It is also there when she takes on the age old standard SOMEDAY.

2892,347359,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00000DG19,Anthony Nasti,True,"'No Security' came out in 1999. When I heard it was from the 'Bridges To Babylon' tour, I was thrilled because I thought it was the soundtrack to the live dvd. How wrong I was. Actually, it's a mishmash of old and new songs taken from different tour stops, with a few tunes from the dvd. The worst things on 'No Security' are the newer songs. 'You Got Me Rocking' isn't exactly one of their signature tunes, and this, the live versions, proves it. 'Saint Of Me' lyrically sounds like 'Sympathy For The Devil, Pt. 2', and it's a bad tune. And I gave up on the Keith Richards-sung blues 'Theif In The Night' before it was finished. And 'Out Of Control' is overblown with a manic production. If you think these new songs are really bad, the band even makes a mess out of one of my favorite old Stones songs. At first, I was thrilled to see that they included a live performance 'Memory Motel'. I thought it would be great to hear Keith and Mick sing a song together live. However, this version is not what I expected. Dave Matthews shares the mic with Mick on the song, while Keith is just relegated to singing only the 'She's Got A Mind...' parts. Matthews' voice also lacks the sincerity of his 'Wild Horses' duet that's on the dvd. However, there are a few excellent exceptions. One of the new songs, 'Flip The Switch' is really good. Kicking off with an excellent Charlie Watts drum solo and featuring the very dynamic, powerful guitar playing chemistry between Keith & Ronnie Wood, it's pure Stones. The band also revives the overlooked 'Sticky Fingers' masterpice 'Sister Morphine', finally giving it the respect it deserves with a gem of a performance. The version of 'Live With Me' most definitely eclipses the versions on 'Let It Bleed' and 'Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out'. This is one of the single best performances of their career. Their version of 'Respectable' is delivered in a respectable version, with hot guitar licks and Mick's wild vocals. Taj Mahal shows to duet with Mick on the blues standard, 'Corinna'. 'Waiting On A Friend' and 'The Last Time' are my two of my favorite tracks here. Both are performed with true Stones showmabship. However, 'Gimme Shelter' is astoundingly great, with awesome guitar licks and the phenomonally great vocals of Lisa Fischer. This is probably the single best performance of the band's career. However, the album's a downer otherwise, and they could've replaced them with great tracks from the tour. Where is 'Satisfaction', the tour's standout? 'Tumbling Dice'? 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'? 'Let's Spend The Night Together'? 'Brown Sugar'? All the great Stones live songs excluded. I'm going to see the Stones at that televised Madison Square Garden HBO concert on January 18th, and if the set list is anything like this, I'm leaving the show.",3,"01 2, 2003","A Few Bright Spots, But Mostly A Downer",1041465600,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},5.0,,matthew satisfaction performance tune madison feature jack think performance saint yer lack sing hbo like come exception ronnie career shelter vocal mess however theif soundtrack true powerful song stop astoundingly hear actually fischer bleed think hot mishmash garden night last finger perform get lyrically mick's favorite dice standout masterpice definitely great drum leave take deserves different brown song dvd downer relegate lisa sister sympathy rock tour bad dynamic watts thing mick really tunes that's respectable prove one include corinna square devil new pure wait chemistry memory wrong pt sticky let motel live mahal go sound good televise single sing security eclipse probably jumpin together album's otherwise let's first list version flash version kicking time switch mind ya-ya's january get would spend overblown share lick part give hear mic standard friend track bad showmabship also production bridge voice even see finally tumble taj band flip solo duet blue wood exclude guitar stone keith overlook show gimme play manic i'm revives dave gem morphine signature best two awesome band's set old finish concert excellent replace thrilled newer make deliver respect tour's richards-sung sugar sincerity expect show exactly charlie phenomonally anything babylon horse wild could've control give

And if you are big fan of these works, you should hear these performances.  The recording is bright and powerful, the orchestral playing impressive, and the approach often inspired.  The 1st and 7th symphonies come off very well, as does the 2nd.  Indeed, the performance of the 7th may be my favorite;  Kitakenko eschews the ending Prokofiev added at a later time. In the more important works, I found Kitajenko to be highlighting the beauty, power and romanticism of many passenges and missing out on the mystery and darkness lurking in these works.  The great 5th symphony is enjoyable here, but I found the tempo variations and push-pulls annoying.  The remastered Karajan blows it away.

Espescially in Bungle, I knew Patton was an ingenius and daring man in music who could hardly be matched. What was better than the endlessly eclectic arrangements was that he was also lyrically talented. Now I know that Faith No More, which maintained a more controlled musical enviroment suited for alternative conoisuers, was just as fantastic. The lyrics are dark in all their beauty, as is the music: ""Land Of Sunshine"": A sardonic funk metal number about angels of generic dreams and green minds getting what they deserve, a mixture of laughter and lecture questions along the way. ""Caffeine"": Angstish rock at its best. Opened by howler monkeys. ""Midlife Crisis"": Geniuses milked to impress, thoughtless middle aged men with jingling pockets and razor incisions of perfection. ""Your menstruating heart ain't bleeding enough for two"". Hiphop metal. ""RV"": Hilarious song of self pity told through the eyes of a lonely man in an RV, spoken over a piano waltz. ""My pants fall down every time I bend over..."" ""Smaller & Smaller"": Definitely one of the best tracks, disturbed and contemplating. A good attack against fascism. ""Everything's Ruined"": More sardonicism. A staged aristocratic family loses all when their posed son is revealed to be fake. ""Malpractice"": Sex frenzies, death metal and deranged screams. This breaks in the middle with childish bells to say ""Knuckle White, Ruffle White"". ""Kindergarten"": Another tale of pity, but this one seems more serious. A guy who keeps failing kindergarten...rock balladry. Waiting. Bell's not ringing. ""Be Aggressive"": Male behaviour in chords. This song is also humorous due to a chorus sung by cheerleaders. ""A Small Victory"": One of my favorites, includes some hiphop sound effects to aid the metal pop.""IT SHOULDN'T BOTHER ME...BUT IT DOES!!!"" More angst, they even made an overlooked video for it. ""Crack Hitler"": Easily one of the craziest tracks, includes a demented man talking about ""bodies floating in the river like fine champagne""...a sarcastic look at Hitler? THere's even what appears to be a Nazi march call in it. ""Jizzlobber"": Sounds like some of the recent death metal rap I've heard lately, this song would probably be popular for the Korn generation around now.

2901,606003,A1AD252PD68POJ,B00096S3QI,Hot Stepper,False,"To start off, alot of people are downing LB as usual.  They say this album is terrible, and so is Limp. They say they have bought every album and hate every one of them. Limp Bizkit must be doing something right if the people who hate them are buying everyone of their albums. With that said, Let's review TUTP1.    This is  the heaviest that Limp Bizkit has ever been since TDBY .  The return of Wes Borland might just save this band.  Every song except ""the key"" is very well written.  You will know Borland is back just by listening to it and Fred's lyrics seem to be getting somewhat better.  Many people are criticizing the band for the heavy influence of RATM.  Am I the only one who thinks there need to be more bands like Rage?  I applaud Limp for that. Limp Bizkit is at their best when they are angry and this album is very angry.  The pros of this album are very strong. The First is that WES IS BACK! Borland's style allows Bizkit to get that attacking vibe to it.  This is not the same band that wrote ""Results"".  Fred's lyrics prove that he has come down to earth and matured with his delivery of his lyrics. Many will say that he is copying Zack from Rage, would you  have preferred Vanilla Ice?  You make that choice. One of Limp's strengths is that you can tell their influence is on their  albums: TDBY: identitical to Snot, Helmet. SO: more of a faith no more style, it does not sound too much like FNM, but it has that feel. CSF and RMV: Record Executives and MTV. CSF sounded like they were not trying or did not care and RMV was accoustic and boring. TUTP1: Rage and a little Pantera.   The only cons of the album are obviously the time of the record (29 min). The Key is only a one minute long, I think that Fred should have made the key into a real song, because thats the best rapping I have ever heard from him. I think that if Limp wrote rap songs as angry as that, people would love or at least enjoy their ""rap"" side. I still think Limp Bizkit has not found a way to perfectly blend Borland's guitar attack with Lethal's sampling/scratching. They really don't use Lethal at all on this album. Some people enjoy that, while others do not.   I liked the TDBY and SO, yet I felt very dissapointed with CSF and RVM. with TUTP1, I feel better about Limp's dirction. I have not enjoyed a Limp Album so much since ""Significant Other"". You may still hate Limp after this album, but you might at least have a differint (better) view of the band .  This might be a new chapter for Limp Bizkit.  If they build on this new style and attitude, their music should be very exciting in the future.  They may even win back many fans who dumped them years ago. YOU HAVE TO LET THE ALBUM GROW ON YOU!

2904,167258,AXMX26ZNGX2YI,B000002I7R,Darren S. Wools,False,"1982 - plant proved to have a knack when picking musicicns for his 1st post zeppelin solo effort.  He of course produced the album on his own.  he picked up a well known drummer with a healthy reputation, phil collins...  Also, robbie blunt on guitar who had played with petty.  On bass he chose paul martinez.  Keyboard responsibilities were handled by jezz woodroffe, another black sabbath veteran.  On 2 songs cozy powell (black sabbath - long time friend) plays drums (slow dancer / like I've never been gone...).  The album has a fairly stripped down funky sound but retains a subtle rock rhythm at the same time.  Plants voice is strong & full with an emotional sincerity.  phil collins, per usual, sets the tone with his complex tempo changes & fast drum fills that are immediately identifiable.  Cozy powell's boring snare drum fills are lackluster next to collins's intricate & articulate philosophy of modern drumming.  the album is consistent with some fairly high points  including burning down one side, midnight in samosa, worse than detroit, & mystery title.  Plant's vocal range is as varied as usual with hints of R&B to straight rock to funky feels.  Blunt's guitar licks are fairly simple with little distortion.

Not that she didn't have the looks, she certainly did but what makes Jody Miller special is her ability to take a song made popular by other artists and make it her own.  Not many people can do this.  Case in point:  Reba McEntire's disastrous ""Starting Over"" CD...in no way could she even start to match the originals.  But Jody's case is different because she HAD the ability to take classic material and make it her own.  Her delivery and phrasing are impeccable.  She also had several hits on original material the best of which is ""Look at Mine"".  ""Country Girl"" is also a great cut!  ""Reflections"" is excellent.  Of the covers she does justice to all of them and shines especially on ""He's So Fine"" and the beautiful ""Baby I'm Yours"".  She is especially touching and poignant on the Shirelle's hit ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and at the end when she softly whispers ""Tell Me Baby"" right before the last tag on ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" one feels the song because she feels it. The arrangement is exceptional!! A great interpreter of lyrics she knows how to put a song over without going over the top like today's country wannabes.

The booklet includes comments for every song by each and every member of the band. Additionally mastermind ""Devin Townsend"" reflects on all five albums individually. Still if you already own all five SYL studio albums the only reason to consider buying this is the bonus live DVD. This include the Download UK show the band played during the farewell tour as well as additional live clips and video clips that span the band's entire career. A very lucrative package indeed, still it has to be clear that these live achieves are NOT the best live performances of SYL. Devin's clean vocals are nowhere as powerful, while regular switching between clean and brutal almost leaves him behind in the song, in addition backing lead vocals are not as well synchronized which subsequently make choruses sound thin rather than explosive. The band also relies a lot more on keyboard and maybe sample sounds than it did in the past.

2920,616873,A34CXLS24ETLMO,B000A1CS68,Jan P. Dennis,False,". . . that is at the same time informed by an astoundingly nave worldview that would be laughable were it not so pathetic.  Charlie Haden, long an armchair champion of Oppressed Peoples Everywhere, has finally located the epicenter of Human Oppression: the US of A.  In the past he used his Liberation Music Orchestra to spotlight oppression in such places as Spain and Latin America and Africa by writing, adapting, and leading his Orchestra in stirring anthems mainly from the Third World.  Now, after three-and-a-half decades, he has discovered that he was wrong.  All that time he was looking for hate in the wrong places.  Idi Amin, Samoza Garcia, Manuel Noriega, Pol Pot--these are not the masters of human oppression.  No, the Grand Master of Human Oppression, the Great Satan himself, is right here in our midst.  It is George Bush.  That is why all the music on this disc is from American (as in USA) composers (save the Dvorak piece, which is sort of honorary American, and, of course ditto for Newton's ""Amazing Grace""):  since we are now dealing with George Bush, master oppressor, let us select anthemic protest music only from his homeland.  How all these tunes morphed into Leftwing anthems is unclear, but apparently they have.  For further enlightenment, listen to what Charlie Haden says in the liner notes:  ""We were hoping sanity and justice would prevail.  They lost out to greed, cruelty and injustice.  The machine won the election again by hook and by crook; the way it won in 2000.  We want the world to know, however, that the devastation that this administration is wreaking is not in our name.  It's not in the name of many people in this country.  This CD brings Carla and me together full circle--thirty six years after we made the first Liberation Music Orchestra recording in 1968 when the Vietnam War was raging.  The issues remain, and our opposition to the inhumane treatment of the universe remains""--blah, blah, blah.  Memo to Charlie:  Before you disgorge any more of your inane blather, have a chat with fellow jazzer Paquito D'Rivera, a defector from that glorious workers paradise that is Cuba, a country you have been won't to praise, and find out what it's like to live under real oppression.  Better yet, read Christopher Lasch's great book, The True and Only Heaven and find out why the progressivist inanity you champion is so bankrupt.  Even better yet, read Louis Dupre's Passage to Modernity and discover the real reason why liberal politics sucks.  However.  Just because the politics is idiotic doesn't mean it's not great music.  We've seen this before; similar rantings and ravings have cropped up in the liner notes of some of Dave Douglas's finest discs.  As I've said elsewhere (in a review of those crazy Canadians, Godspeed You! Black Emperor), the mere desire for justice, liberation, and freedom from oppression--no matter how wildly misplaced--can be a powerful force for great music.  As can anger.  And that's why this is such a great disc.  It's driven be sincere, if sadly misplaced, passions.  Still, I'm puzzled as to why jazz musicians like Charlie Haden assume all people who listen to jazz music share their political views.  If you read through my reviews, I think you'll find my tastes in jazz AS MUSIC are as progressivist and radical as anyone's.  And I love Charlie Haden's music.  But I voted for George Bush, and I'm really, really glad I did.  Question for Charlie:  How could you vote for a man (John Kerry) who claims to be a member of a church body, the Catholic Church, whose self-understanding includes the idea that authoritative teaching resides in its pope and bishops, and then say that the bishops' views on abortion ""are just their opinion""?  Another question for Charlie:  Why are you using your music to propagandize for radical politics?  Why not just keep the inspiration for you music to yourself, and let the music speak for itself?  Don't you get it?  I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR POLITICS OF ALIENATION.  And I really resent reading your rants in the liner notes.  But I DO love your music.

2922,1037916,A2AWHSNAR5OUZ4,B00NOW9J9Y,Bone Monkey,False,"On April 12th, 2012 Demonocracy was released. It was Job For a Cowboy's third full-length album. Since that release, many have been waiting and wondering what the next step would be for the band. Two and half years later, here we are; about to evaluate Sun Eater, the new, anticipated project that has had fans drooling since the release of their single ""Sun of Nihility"". This band from Arizona has produced some interesting releases, so what's to be expected from Sun Eater? Will there be a natural progression in their technical attributes or will JFAC revert back to a heavier approach?  Sun Eater will be the fourth release by this band. This is not including two separate EPs that contribute to the band's discography, which has been in the making since the formation of JFAC in December 2003. Typically, I enjoy weighing the differences between the band's previous release and their newest discharge, but given the qualities of both Demonocracy, and Sun Eater, it would be unfair to indulge in this typical manner of comparison. The differences are too great to accurately apply this formula, much in the same way when comparing White Chapel's A New Era of Corruption, to their following Self Titled release. Fear not though, not all change is bad, and in this situation, Sun Eater will be able to stand the test of time once it is released on November 11th, 2014.  To understand what JFAC is doing with Sun Eater, it's important to know their past growth and evolution. The band started out as a heavier extreme death metal band, and has kept that label for the most part through the years. Each release is unique, some better than others, but all technical and well formulated. The jump that Sun Eater makes is obvious. From the single ""Sun of Nihility"", it's apparent the band has changed. This is not a single that stands alone as the best song on the album, nor do all the other tracks revert back to a prehistoric version of themselves.  The album breathes life into the death metal genre as an album that can truly stand alone and be compared to nothing else. Wondering riffs, groove driven guitar segments, solos, and deathly vocals all remain a staple in this JFAC release, but what's new is what happens to be the most attractive. The consistent pace of the album is the un-deniable driving factor in bringing their dependable new sound to a whole new level. There are slower and faster segments, but in all, the album paces itself well. This is a strength. It helps the listener digest, and plow through the tracks at a rewarding rate. After fully feeding on the progress, the listener will be able to remember distinctions and highlights throughout. The progressive feel is also a refreshing touch. Ambient segments in the closing of ""Buried Monuments"", and slow introductions on ""Worming Nightfall"" leave a high quality impression of the song writing abilities that draw in the listener. It allows the listener to be let go, leaving no questions to be asked, and no feelings harassed. The layered guitar parts, coupled with amplified bass segments, impact the listener in a whole new way which puts the final touches on this new congregated sound.  This will not be an album for everyone. If you're looking for a powerful heavy album to jam to and are hoping for another Doom release, or need a mind blowing album that shreds, move along. Sun Eater remains an album that will be a solid brick in the foundation of the death metal genre with no gimmicks or trends to back it up. Just solid music.  *This review was originally written for Metal Injection by Nate.

There are color photos in the booklet and it also includes track discography.  Each CD has been remastered beautifully and you can really hear Grace warbling on some of the songs especially on PORTFOLIO. I don't know if she had some vocal coaching after a few of the first cuts, but once you get to ""La Vie En Rose"" her voice is much more confident sounding and finds its own pitch, rhythm, and style that she would go on to hone and serve to us once she got to Compass Point (1980s) recording sessions.  Likewise, there are plenty of extra tracks on each CD that make this set worth buying even if you already have the original LPs or CDs of any of the three.  The album covers have been recreated and each CD is housed in its own jacket, and all three, including the booklet, store inside the thick and sturdy black box that is shown in the item picture.  I knocked off one-star because the CDs are just placed inside the cardboard album jacket without any type of protection like a plastic sleeve and the cardboard jacket isn't laminated on the inside, so the CDs could become scratched or damaged when taking them in/out. I don't know why the company Island/Universal, which lovingly produced the set, would simply drop the ball on this last step? It seems odd since everything else about the set was given the proper attention and care.  Most would say that this is nitpicking but if you scratch the CD in the right way it will skip on that section and become unplayable.  Otherwise this would be a solid 5-star reissue. In any case, GRACE JONES: DISCO is definitely worth picking up. Also, like another reviewer pointed out, be sure of the format you are buying. When this set was up for pre-order the item's description was scarce so I had inadvertently ordered the bluray music disc of DISCO and had to send it back.  If you are unfamiliar with Grace Jones's work, I would suggest starting off with the CD ISLAND LIFE (ASIN B000001FTH) which provides not only the stand out tracks from the first two albums (Portfolio, Fame) but also includes the best cuts of the 80s (and includes the single ""Slave To The Rhythm"").",4,"06 17, 2015",BEAUTIFUL  Reissue But *Minus * One-Star For Poor CD Housing,1434499200,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},9.0,,know fame sleeve track record send inadvertently plastic black vocal much compass listener work way item's asin like protection understand pitch ball order extra skip reviewer cardboard cover section disc could songs simply scarce take portfolio pre-order last get in/out one-star photo sturdy seem definitely buying sure disco nitpick solid color already deserve description knock provide place box lps music thick little island/universal write really suggest picture format point damage show daryl hone unfamiliar bluray back original place right point odd help unplayable slave lovingly session company jacket single likewise type confident worth become otherwise first island come author step warble time produce scratch especially la rhythm would get album booklet house hear item everything track cd also circa vie rise attention voice bio even proper plenty find inside else en pick drop laminate make case album cut serve style since best set reissue two without easlea describes include include jones's life sound contextualize coach go jones scratch cd say three another start give discography remastered beautifully store recreate care grace stand

Well, the wait is over and the final results are pretty good.  Nothing outstanding, but still pretty good.  I was a little disappointed that a lot of this stuff is already on a few of his mixtapes, thus the lower rating.  Production is handled by fellow Justus League producers Khrysis and 9th Wonder with some assistance from Ayatollah, PF Cuttin, Agallah (a.k.a. 8-Off), and a few others.  The album is full of hot tracks and has a few of the usual BCC suspects (Buckshot, Cocoa Brovaz, OGC, & Rock).  Tracks like ""Boom Bye Yeah"", ""The Brokest Rapper You Know"", and ""Peep My Words"" all bang without sounding the same.  Also, ""Rising To The Top"" feat. Agallah (from Grand Theft Auto III) is at the end of the album.  That alone made this album worth owning to me.  The lyrics on the album are all on point, so most of the shortcomings on this album come from the production side of things.  ""Heartburn"" isn't wack, but it's pretty forgettable -- even the production from 9th Wonder couldn't help that track.  ""One Two Y'all"" has some tight lyrics, but the production has a sleep inducing effect.  The fact that some of the tracks are pretty boring is the only negative thing about the album.  All of the flows are on point.  Monkey Barz is more than worth purchasing.  If you're looking for that grimy, Sean Price vintage flow, it's available here.  The production is pretty monotonous from time to time, and there is some mixtape material on here, but it's still worth a listen.  I reccomend this one to the casual fans as well as others.

2940,1388868,A2A55AXWOFFDVZ,B005NKS2TS,Johannes Climacus,True,"This set is such an outstanding bargain, it is worth adding to one's collection even if one already owns multiple versions of the works it contains.  Bostock's cycle of Nielsen symphonies, shorter orchestral pieces and concertos was originally issued by the Classico label (now defunct?), and probably didn't get the attention by critics that they deserved.  They are all first-rate performances, a bit rough around the edges perhaps, but none the worse for that (better to sacrifice perfection of execution to passion in Nielsen, than the other way around).  Bostock's *Espansiva* is as fine as any in the catalog, and better than most.  Among the versions I know, only Bernstein and Chung surpass it, though I don't particularly like the way the two wordless vocal soloists are positioned in relation to the orchestra in the second movement.  Nor do they distil quite the magic needed for this Garden-of-Eden Idyll.  The *Inextinguishable* and no. 5 are both outstanding performances; that vital current so essential in Nielsen is always in evidence.  I am perhaps less taken with Bostok's *Four Temperaments* and no. 1.  For one thing, the recording is more distant seeming in these works, and some important detail gets covered up as a result (a problem also in no. 5, second movement).  Bostok's take on the First is fairly easy-going; fine for a work that is mostly lyrical in conception, though I do want more incisive attacks than Bostok provides in this symphony.  No. 2, on the other hand, has plenty of incisive attacks, but is rather too aggressive in approach, and the ""Malincolico"" slow movement doesn't plumb the depths (or seize the listener) quite as effectively as Bernstein in his NY Philharmonic recording.  Bostock makes as persuasive a case for the enigmatic no. 6 as I have heard; the satirical element is much in evidence, as it must be.  My criticisms are in truth mostly minor ones.  Anyone coming to the Nielsen Symphonies for the first time will probably be blown away by the intensity and conviction of Bostock's renditions; and the Liverpudlians are with him every step of the way.  As another reviewer has opined, the wind and brass playing of this ensemble are particularly impressive.  The strings marginally less so (though they sing out superbly in the slow movement of no. 4).  The shorter orchestral pieces (some of them quite rare) and concertos are generally well performed and recorded.  For the wind concertos and the works for string orchestra, Bostock leads a crack ensemble from the Czech Republic.  The Flute Concerto is splendidly done; the soloist plays with a mellifluous tone that falls sweetly on the ear. The Violin and Clarinet Concertos are well enough played and have plenty of character, though Bostock's soloists don't quite displace the competition (e.g., Lin and Kang in the Violin Concerto, Drucker in the Clarinet Concerto).  Among the shorter orchestral pieces, *Helios* fares best: a terrific performance that will lift you to the skies.  The string-orchestra works receive neat, well-tuned renditions from Bostock's Czech forces, though this chamber-sized group sounds a bit thin at times.  I would have preferred a more opulent sound.  The two major chamber works included (Wind Quintet, Violin Sonata no. 1) are unevenly matched.  The Quintet is crisply and sensitively done, while the Sonata--a sublime masterpiece that remains one of Nielsen's most underrated works--is given a relatively uninspired reading with a poorly balanced recording that accounts, least in part, for the violinist's squeaky tone and the reticent-sounding piano.  Anne land plays a generous selection of piano pieces, many of them surprisingly modernistic in style, with keen discernment and formidable virtuosity.  I find it difficult to evaluate the efforts of baritone soloist,Ulrich Cold in the songs, since I have no standard of comparison, and no texts or translations are provided. However, I can vouch for the fact that he has a pleasant voice and sings expressively, though it would be nice to know what he's singing about!  The songs seem to be arranged in a particular order; the first group appear to be folksong settings some with a patriotic flavor (I have a sufficiently rudimentary knowledge of Danish to discern this much).  Subsequent groups fall more into the idiom of art-songs; some sound vaguely like Brahms, others bear the stamp of Nielsen's distinctive harmonic language, and manifest the distinctive shape of his melodic lines.  All are pleasant, and some are quite beautiful indeed.  In the end, the strengths of this compilation sufficiently outweigh any weaknesses (of performance, recording, or presentation) to warrant a strong recommendation.  Bostock's renditions of the orchestral works are, in the main, hugely satisfying.  The concertos and chamber works are more variable; but given the price range, it would be idle to complain! Nielsen is one of the 20th Century's greatest composers, though still in many ways under-appreciated, and every music lover needs a comprehensive representation of his output in their collection.

2952,786536,AA6HMCJRRH83P,B001DSNG22,Hostile Apostle,True,"I have been a fan since Welcome.  Then I backtracked to Gift, which by the way, is a great album.  ""Smile"" and ""Again and Again"" are two of the best songs I've ever seen live.  I saw these guys once on the Welcome tour and twice on the Blue Sky Research tour.  I've seen over 50 bands live, ranging from Rage Against the Machine to the Beastie Boys(actually that was the same show and it was killer!!), but my favorite is Taproot.  The energy simply can't be matched and Stephen has the least forced scream I've witnessed in person.  I was a huge fan of Blue Sky Research.  Easily their most diverse record, the tempo shifted from heavy to melodic and back seamlessly throughout the entire album.  That brings us to Our Long Road Home.  Recorded in a remodeled barn near Stephen's home in Michigan, the band created it's first independent album since pre-Gift, giving them the freedom to do whatever they wanted.  Unfortunately on some tracks, it's easy to understand why.  Don't get me wrong, there are some killer cuts here.  Old school fans will still dig the hell out of ""Path Less Taken"" and ""Take It.""  ""Karmaway"" may be the highlight of the whole album.  With its lazy, soaring guitar riff, it has a very un-Taproot vibe to it, almost epic in a way.  The single ""Wherever I Stand"" is pretty catchy, but not in the same realm as past singles like ""Poem"" or ""Calling.""  ""Be the 1"" grows on you and ""Stethoscope"" is a beautiful instrumental that seems like it could've been better off as an intro to an actual song.  With the good however, come the bad.  ""Run to"" is the definition of cheesy nu-metal rock, even more so than ""Promise"" from BSR.  The chorus just feels forced and would've been more appropriately sung by Chris Daughtry.  It's just not very good.  ""It's Natural"" features the first time use of female vocals by the band, with lackluster results.  The remaining tracks here are just average.  Our Long Road Home in a nutshell isn't a bad effort from Taproot, just not what I've come to expect from a band that has never ceased to amaze over the years.  I guess it's basically what I expected: some really killer jams, and some effortless pop songs.

It truly makes you wonder what was left behind, as we know he has the potential to make some truly inspiring music.

2965,540460,A5NM2XYNSLV1A,B0000A4G68,Amazon Customer,False,"Kalmah is perhaps ones of the most refreshing and even perhaps different bands to come along in a while. Their first two albums, Swamplord and They Will Return, although both sounded similar in production, was excellent in both song writing and song stucture. Blazing leads, brutal drums and bass, and some great raspy screams from vocalist Pekka Kokko. Kalmah's first two albums also sounded heavily influenced by Megadeths early work, just check out ""Skin o' my Teeth"" on They Will Return, a Megadeth cover.   Swampsong, the band's third effort, sounded completely different in terms of how it was produced, and how the guitars sounded. From the start of the opening track ""Heroes to Us"" I thought I accidently had placed a Children of Bodom cd in. The guitars sound almost exactly like Bodom's trademark sound on Swampsong. Not that this is a band thing, but it is my only real gripe with this album. If i wanted to listen to Children of Bodom I would have put on a Children of Bodom cd. Kalmah's guitar sound on their first two albums sounded as if they were being played in muddied, rancid swamp water right from their home in Finland, and I thought that sounded excellent. However, like I said, no big deal here. Even though the guitars sound different in terms of distortion and production, they still shred out some blazing riffs with just incredible solos. The drums continue to hammer away with a great performance from drummer Janne Kusmin. Another thing that was different about Swampsong, compaired to their two other releases, is the use of the keyboards. Kalmah had used the keys as more as an atmospheric instrument, a background instrument if you will. On this album, Swampsong, the keys are pretty much nonexistent. I know the band was having problems keeping keyboard players in the band, and they decided to use the keys less, perhaps even cut them out all together and use guitar fills to replace some of the keyboard parts, so this is something which is not a huge impact on the band's sound.   The songs are structured out very well, and the production is very good also. The lyrics are a bit average, not really that deep as found in bands like My Dying Bride or Opeth, but then, this is melodic metal, which focuses more on guitars then lyrics.   Kalmah only sounds like Children of Bodom in the aspect of how their actual guitars sound, the distortion being used or special effects, other then this, I cannot see a resemblance. Kalmah has more black metal influences, and very old school 80's sound like Megadeth, where Bodom sounds more like a new form of heavy, fast, thrash whom uses keyboards heavilly.   Kalmah is a great band, with extremely talented musicians. If you are a fan of Children of Bodom, Norther, even black metal bands like Emperor, Dimmu Borgir, and the like, then check out Kalmah.

2968,881564,A1A9WXPQVE7D87,B005FG3BTQ,GFX,True,"Matthew Sweet is the guy who turned me onto the alternative rock sound back in the 90's with an appearance on Allan Havey's Night After Night on Comedy Network.  The pop and rock with Anime visuals of Girlfriend go me hooked and my admiration of his music started there... it doesn't end here, but maybe Mr Sweet and I need musical counseling.  Some albums take me a while to like (such as Blue Skies On Mars) and some I loved instantly (100% Fun), Modern Art on first blush is one I am going to have trouble really liking.  The production and effort put forth by Mr Sweet feels more like a very polished demo recording.  Some of this might be the barebones style of the album, not many hands on deck.  As for the sound, Modern Art is mostly, to me, more of a slightly more rock version of Gordon Lightfoot.  I think Sunshine Lies sort of pointed the way here, but I was hoping Mr Sweet would snap back to a sound I like more.  Whereas past efforts have always bridged that rift between rock and pop it feels like a mix between pop and 70's easy listening.  There is not a track after giving a once over that I really remember and I might not put this album on full or exclusive rotation in my library (I am old fashioned in that I do like listening to full albums on a regular basis).  The quality of production is top notch and sports a different sound, which after referring to the liner notes is it was digital to analog back to digital.  I am not sure if this makes Modern Art better, but it has a slightly different sound which I can appreciate.  All said and done I am not sure who this album is for, is it going to attract new listeners?  No, it is not that good or distinctive of an album.  Is it going to make long term fans of Matthew Sweet fans happy?  Speaking for myself on this mark, no.  Is it a bad album?  No... but it is one that leaves me confused and disappointed.

So it's understandable that I love this live album, with its sizzling covers of the Nervous Eaters' ""Loretta,"" Buffy Saint-Marie's ""Soulful Shade of Blue,"" Loretta Lynn's ""Rated X,"" plus the newly penned ""If You Knew."" All this in addition to the sultry waltz ""Hex,"" among other slower tunes. (For my money, though, the standout track is her cover of the Shangri-Las' ""Train from Kansas City,"" on which she positively channels Petula Clark and takes us back 40 years without missing a beat.) And it's not just Neko. The Sadies turn in a virtuoso performance as her backing band (check out the snare on ""Train"" and the guitars on ""Loretta""), and Kelly Hogan and Carolyn Mark on harmonies make what would have been great performances anyway simply sublime.

I was a huge fan of their studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, as well as the half-""outtake""/half-live album Still, which I consider their most overlooked release. The only JD which you truly don't need is Permanent, I'll never understand that one.  As for this one, it contains two tracks from the out-of-print debut EP, which is a pleasant surprise for fans like me who didn't get exposed to JD in their time (well, I've been for only three years). It begins with the classic track ""Warsaw"", as well as the fact that singles like ""Atmosphere"" appear here, where classics you can find elsewhere of the band, like Unknown Pleasure's ""She's Lost Control"". This one, along with Still, makes me wonder what they would have done, but New Order were pretty good even if not as consistently as this band.  Ian Curtis was one of my favorite vocals. It's distinctive of other vocalists, and the emotion could be heard in it. My favorite Joy Division tracks, ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and ""Dead Souls"" are here. The latter has a classic bass line, and Bernard Sumner's riffs are really awesome. It's no big surprised that NIN would later cover it, seeing as the riff sounds something like what Trent Reznor would be influenced by.

I found this on amazon & on the strength of just a couple of selections ordered it. I wasn't disappointed. Tebaldi has a sweetness and charm to her voice that has always suited Puccini roles. While the voice is strong, there's a vulnerability in it, much like the role of Minnie. She does hit a couple of strident notes but overall this is a terrific Minnie. Especially nice are two scenes, 1) the one where she is reading the Bible to the miners and 2) the one at the end of Act I where Johnson is telling her not to cry, that she has the face of an angel- her sobbing is very real sounding, but not overpowering the wonderful legato & pianissimo of Del Monaco.  Which brings me to him. I think this is one of the best recordings of his I've ever heard. His strong steely voice is just right for Johnson and he seems to sing with a sensitivity here that is very special. I personally think these two were meant to sing these roles. Too bad they were too young to do the premier (which featured Caruso & Destinn.)  And last, but NOT least, Cornell MacNeil. His Rance is to freakin' die for! His aria, ""Minnie, dalla mia casa"" is so sumptuous, sexy and appealing I nearly slipped off my seat the first time I heard it!

I'm not sure what song(s) he has out right now, but I guess it really doesn't matter because none of the songs really stand out. However, if you bypass the filler like ""Tweneanunda"", ""Money Don't Mean A Thing"", the title track, ""A.N.G.E.L.""...um, actually, most of the songs are just okay. The rest of the songs have too many missteps, like ""Sho Ya Right"" and the badly written ""Truth"". Another thing I'd like to mention is - and I'll probably get some unhelpful votes for this - doesn't Dwele sound just like Musiq? They both seem to have that speak-singing thing going on; also, ""Hold On"" and ""Sho Ya Right"" will remind you of Musiq's songs ""Just Friends (Sunny)"" and ""Future"", respectively. At first I was going to give this album three stars, but that was before I heard the end of the album. ""Whoomp"" and ""Let Your Hair Down"" definitely could have been left behind. And after Dwele blessed ""Tainted"", Slum Village apparently decided to return the favor by showing up on the second version of ""A.N.G.E.L."".

2999,182565,A3A0GTGE1FMV6G,B000002J27,Noel Pratt,True,"KEEP YOUR 94's. So much sounds so different here, it's like it's not even the same mix. It's out with the cozy and familiar, in with the...scary. Collins' vocals sound too high. The speeds of ""Squonk,"" ""Ripples,"" maybe other tracks, sound sluggish, actually slower. The keys on ""Entangled"" are quite attenuated, and the bass thuds to the ground and stays there in certain places. The vibes are generally weird and bastardized-sounding throughout, and the volume is also cranked way up (usually suspicious when nothing's been done, but here brazen and purposeless). In the light of all this, who cares if you can hear the lyrics better? Or a bell or a whistle... I have my doubts about the validity of the harmonic backing vocals on ""Dance on a Volcano""; again, just be prepared to hear something that either wasn't properly hearable or wasn't even supposed to be hearable before this release. I haven't found much to commend this effort; they've taken a smooth, lovely, and quietish album and made it sound like there're new-agey space mutants tickling their tendrils all over the control board, geekily pushing buttons. They must've pushed one of mine. I'm so glad the recent ELP remasters didn't go this way. You're still hearing Genesis but you might start kicking yourself for humming along.
