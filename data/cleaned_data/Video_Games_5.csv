Fast-forward to 2002 and the Xbox is screaming for a decent four-player game that uses the same basic principle that won Gauntlet so much acclaim. I'll start first with the control scheme as comfort while playing the game decides whether or not it's picked up again. The control scheme is close to where you won't realize your holding a controller and you'll feel comfortable enough to go through the game. Sound is decent enough with the ambience delivered by the game is enough to send a shiver or two down your spine at points throughout the game. The concept is close enough with a feeling of a four player resident evil in which you fight the undead through the streets of a no-name town. Playability is good enough with the ease of being able to pick the game up and just go is really good. Finally, the replay value on the game is really good as it is worth being able to pull the game out and play it while you have three friends over. Start the game at about 8 in the evening and the fun just goes on from there. However, with this genre it can be a situation of hit or miss depending on how you feel about games built on the platform of multiplayer.

I was never too fond of SRPG's and then i played Disgaea 1 which got me hooked. Still these games, as you should know, can consume 100's of hours of your life. The insane amount of levels you could get(not only your character but items as well!) was what hooked me but theres so much more to do and each addition to the series keeps adding even more! I would say the 3rd one(this one) has the best gameplay. In terms of characters though i would rank it after Disgaea 1 but better than 2's. The story is alright(somewhat short though) with some neat twists, and the characters voice actors do a good job in my opinion. The graphics are the same as the first two, but Disgaea 4 NIS said will have better graphics. Though i hope its keeps the same charm it has always had. If the graphics discourage from getting this don't let it!! The grinding of levels gets annoying sometimes but i always come back after taking an 1-2 week break. If you like trophy's this game got a patch to include trophies it now has a whole ton of them to earn.

17,162041,3,False,"10 9, 2012",A2SLX6UHHYCMCV,B00178630A,M. Cordoba,"I've been playing Blizzard games for a while. The original Diablo, Diablo 2, LoD. Also Warcraft I, 2, 3, and World of Warcraft, Starcraft 1, SC2. This is the first of all those games that left me just disappointed at the end. Because there is nothing redeeming about it.  Lets start with the good things - because Blizzard did a lot of good things with this game: 1. Respeccing. (You can change the way you play with your character at will, no need to level up 2 different characters to try different builds or skill trees) You can mix and match skills as you like. 2. Stats get auto incremented with level (previous games involved putting everything on vitality pretty much, with your main stat as secondary if you wanted to beat it in higher levels). 3. Graphics are great and run well on lower end machines. I run with full detail on a 4 year old PC desktop (at 1080p), and a 3 year old 13 inch mac laptop with an igp (integrated graphic processor, as opposed to discreet powerful graphic card) runs on medium/low settings at 1280 x 800. That's also a pro - you can play this game for both Mac and PC and not miss a beat. (even if you're like me and have a pc desktop and a mac laptop) 4. All classes are fun and distinct 5. Gear makes you look very different, and you can dye it for further customization 6. The story (first play through) is fun an engaging -hack and slash, but still fun. 7. No longer a health potion fest (each potion has a time limit) 8. Shared stash between characters  So up until I turned 60, I would have rated this game 4 or 5 starts. So in theory you got around 50 good hours of play time. First play through in normal/nightmare/hell.  Fun hack and slash... However, it has a few fatal flows:  The Bad: - In Normal, Nightmare, and Hell, the game is ridiculously easy. Too easy really, no challenge what so ever, so it gets a little boring. - You hit inferno act 1, and then you feel like it's a challenging game finally! It gets hard, you fight through, die a few times, and think - finally the game presents a challenge. Then act 2 comes around, it's a little harder, you die a few more times, but still make it through. Then ACT 3 hits you, and the difficulty just went to another level, if you're resistances aren't close to 1000, you'll struggle. Elites are really hard and can kill you in a couple of shots. So you try to buy gear to power through, AH is so expensive, so you sacrifice a lot of MF(magic find) and GF(gold find) to get a lot of + resist all and vitality items. You struggle mightitly and spend most of your gold, and power through. OR join a pug, and the game becomes super easy. - 99.999% of all gear drops are terrible, unusable by ANY class, not just your own. For example, you'll get an axe with 100 dexterity and 100 intelligence, and a Bonus to barbarians Revenge skill. (both dex and intel are virtually useless for a Barbarian). Or a big shield with 180 STR, and 4% crit chance for wizards (STR useless for a Wizard). and the drops, especially in inferno are plentiful - a run to Kill Azmodovan with a decent magic find, will net you around 30 or so yellow items, and around 50+ blue items. I've did that run about a dozen times or so. (so say 1000+ items altogether). None were upgrades to stuff I've bough in the AH for relatively cheap. I've seen 1 epic drop during that time, and it was a terrible item, not even level 60, despite the fact that the enemy was level 63. Maybe 5 of those 1000 items were good for other classes and might be worth selling in the AH. Which brings me to the next point: - since the drops are so useless, the AH is the place to get gear. Which feels kind of lame. I didn't fight for a shield, or got a great drop after defeating X boss 10 times. No, I spent some gold to buy an item in the AH, because all the drops are terrible. So basically, it's an Auction House dominated game. You get your gear there, or sell good drops you don't want there. This is not directly Blizzard fault, but say after running the game in inferno a few times, you got like 10 million gold. A clear upgrade over what I have, would be one of the set items, that people sell for 150+ million on the AH. So read up strategies to farm gold and farm gold to get more gear to... lame. - No replayability, terrible post 60. So at 60 in inferno, I played in groups, did a few other things, and what was the result? Not much. Not 1 item upgrade (sure luck plays a part here) but there was just nothing redeeming about it. The fights are all disorganized, since there is no healer it's just everyone hacking and slashing everything in the screen. And in groups, it is SUPER easy to get through inferno. I struggled through it as a Barbarian solo, but in a group, it's a quick romp through (act 3).  So basically the game has 2 parts: ACT 1 and 2 = great story, great length, awesome environments. ACT 3 and ACT 4 = not as great, but still fun and what not. You discover new abilities and get to play with ALL of them (awesome) and respecc after any fight - great.  Then you hit level 60 and are gridning inferno... for gear? That's all there is to it. Gear grinding, where drops are 99.9% useless, the game is easy, the hack and slash just gets boring. There is no new content to explore, no epic boss battles, just the same old, same old.  - So basically - if you just want 20-40 hours of fun (hitting 60, while exploring everything you find) Diablo 3 is probably a fun hack and slash. (4 stars, 1 star taken off due to the super easy diffculty through Hell).  - If you are hoping for end game content, or attaining the nice epic gear or sets, the game will get boring really quick and not worth it. 1 star. No pvp still, useless drops for all classes, doing the same dungeon over and over, no new content, no epic battles, nothing redeeming.  I had fun through Inferno the first time, when it was ""time"" to grind to get better gear, it just became apparent how lacking the game is once you hit end game. So that's why it gets 3 stars. But if I had to do it again, I would not buy this game.

You see this is a side-scrolling game which is a view from the side where you can jump, enemies will hurt you and make you lose lives, if you lose them all, its game over which makes you lose check points, etc. (places in levels [you start from the beginning of the level, you must find your way to the end to progress to the next one] where you can continue from if you lose) Diddy kong will fallow you wherever you go however he does not limit your speed. On the level-selection map, left on control pad makes you go back to levels you have already beaten, right makes you continue forward a level, one that may or may have not be beaten. Up and down are the same (you might need them giving left and right no effect depending on where you are). The A button makes you start the level you are on, start opens the menu where you can save, etc. select asks you if you wnat to quit, and the B button lets you cancel these two menus. In a level, up lets you climb up ropes you have jumped on, right makes you move right, left makes you move left, down makes you duck and clib down ropes, and when you are playing as donkey kong down and the B button is a special attack. A button is jump, and the B button is most important. By holding down B, you can go MUCH faster. It is actually essential for some places. If you just press the B  button, you swiftly roll into and enemy (you can also jump on them to beat them). Select lets you switch between donkey kong and diddy kong (however  whoever is beaten the one behind take his place) and finnaly start lets you pause (you can quit the level if you have beaten it).  The graphic are AWSOME even though this game was orginally a 16-bit snes game. You can do all of the levels over again, you can even battle the bosses again, and you cn EVEN battle k.rool (the final boss) again (however don't worry, its still saves once you beat the game).

There are also two mini games, one where you have to time your button presses to dance right, and one where you must fish specific fish using your hook. And finnaly, there's DK attack where you must improve your score as you do timed stages (the ones you have beaten in the real game), bannanas which are like coins, get 100 and you get an extra life, instead add to your score, you can pick up more time in various places, etc. All in all, it is a really great game, if you like DK games, Want a cute sidescroller, or like sidescrolling games, you should get it.",DK country!!,1186963200,,,,clib gold move menu king)k.rool score much view sidescroller find hurt open button way plot pad kong like stand candy however depend extra boss level beat evil add need character four actually might underwater fallow think level-selection ride one coin next whoever cute bannanas sword get video important point side-scrolling press kong's limit take roll pick great already pause real must crocidle graphic frog sidescrolling wherever leave fun faster really ape belly donkey place jump one enemy duck hook beat back ostrich place right attack huh quit enemies diddy hold rhino kind cn nephew cranky speed swiftly probably let's effect stage menus game want cruddy dk help time switch let climb improve various give check level bos bad etc game imagining also snes talk still k.rool even see jump mini start battle time awsome forward save select side make ask special wnat play begin steal life continue orginally press funky two worry map rope gameplay progress instead though life specific behind end finnaly make there's famous go well use animal essential save final may lose dance fish cancel he's pretty control

The problem for the casual gamer with prime 2 is that it has too much nuisance and less fun, and not an equitable balance, I think that you actually can have a little bit of nuisance but not throw your controller down frustration, and the game has to enthrall you to the point where you want to keep playing.

This is especially appearant now that the game is over a decade old(!) and the flash no longer holds up as well on the GBA port.  Still Rareware really did an excellent job, and their success here propelled the company to a strong supporting role on the Nintendo 64. Gameplay is on the easy side, but the levels are still a blast to play through. There are lots of varied environments and things to see, with no dull moments in sight. A fitting memorable soundtrack adds to the experience. Plus, Donkey Kong Country revitalized one of Nintendo's dormant characters, taking him from a pixelated barrel-throwing ape to a rendered, barrel-throwing ape with attitude.

It did away with the monotony of ""Metroid II"" and enhanced the gameplay and environment of the original ""Metroid"".  The puzzles and challenges presented by this version captivated all kinds of gamers.  It re-hashed the original story and gave it some extra kick.  New weapons and abilities were introduced, as were more complex storylines.  Having never played any of the 'Metroid' games before this one, it was quite a spectacular introduction.  Now, fast foward a few years.  Knowing that the new GameBoy Advance System is making quite a profit out of porting old Super NES games for handheld, I was interested to see if Nintendo was going to put ""Super Metroid"" on the GBA.  Well, they did, sort of.  The game that ended up being developed for GBA was called ""Metroid Fusion"" and it resembles ""Super Metroid"" in many ways.  However, there are several distinctions.  For starters, this takes place AFTER ""Super Metroid"" and adds a new wrinkle to story by creating a new nemesis called 'parasite X' which was able to procreate after our hero, Samus, wiped out all of the Metroids on SR 388.  This parasite is a menace to the entire universe and all traces of it on SR 388 and the orbital research lab must be destroyed.  ""... Fusion"" takes place entirely aboard the orbital research lab and employs most of the same gameplay that ""Super Metroid"" did.  It's still a side-scroller and it presents many of the same obstacles of its predecessor.  There are numerous different types of doors that are sealed and unable to be accessed unless certain criteria are met.  There are other access points and hidden entries that can only be discovered if you have the right weapons or know where to look.  In addition, throughout the game, there are several different bosses Samus must defeat in order recover certain powers.  It's hard to truly describe how satisfying this game really is.  You really need to play it yourself to see first hand.  Rest assured, though.

The hardest wagglers (like my gf) will win almost all the time, no matter what skill level you are. A straight waggle fest dominates this game, which is a bit dissapointing. There is a defensive counter attack, but a very hard determined waggler can break through it!

The graphical presentation is up 10 fold, the subtle music is cool and not annoying, but the best are the signature Nintendo'd sound effects that make every game addicting and unique.

With Port Royale 3, they've added an adventurer campaign so if you want to go around shooting pirates and saving princesses, you can do that, or go with the merchant campaign if you more like sailing around, making money and building little shipping empires.

And again, like most, I was somewhat disappointed with it.  The same gameplay is here, the same engaging interface, the same main characters. There are several new villains to battle and the storyline is very involved, though not as involved as the first Splinter Cell. You do travel to some interesting geographic areas, like Jerusalem, Indonesia - even LAX.  I was initially encouraged by the game, when the second level turned out to be one of the coolest Splinter Cell levels in both games combined - the train level. At the start of the level, Sam finds himself on the top of a speeding train in the middle of the night. You have to climb down the side, almost getting clipped by another locomotive passing. The graphics in this level are amazing and it's unlike anything you'll see in the first installment of the game. Then there is Jerusalem, amazingly recreated to cinematic proportions. At this point I began to notice the music. The same Splinter Cell themes were there, but performed with a Middle Eastern orchestra, incorporating percussion and instruments native to that area only. I was pretty impressed with this attention to detail.  But then the game began to wane. It was more like work than gaming. Many of the levels have a 1-alarm limit. Someone sees you - that's it. You're restarting from the last save point, which was probably several minutes back. I found that there was very little action and a great deal of strategy, which is fine I suppose - that's what you get in a Splinter Cell game. But sometimes it was to an excessive point, and I was just trying to get to the next save point, not really engaging in the Splinter Cell world. At other times I was rather impressed with the attention to puzzles. In one level you must navigate a dark mine field - with your thermal goggles - while spotlights scan the surrounding area. However, the spotlights are timed in such a way that you must move at very specific times, in a very specific pattern. It was well thought out.  The ending was very anti-climactic, and I wasn't even sure it was the real ending until the credits started rolling. I didn't feel the game was particularly long. I'd be interested to see how it compares to the original in its length. In the first game I felt almost overwhelmed as the levels kept coming and coming. In Pandora Tomorrow, as I said, I was surprised at how quickly the ending came.  All in all, I expected much more. It was essentially the same game as the original but with new levels and a new story.  I've read some about Splinter Cell 3 due out later this year (or early next year). It's supposed to be the game that most of us expected Pandora Tomorrow to be. A completely redesigned interface, a sound meter (to go with stealth), new weapons and completely new ways to circumnavigate your enemies are just a few of the features. I suppose Pandora Tomorrow was released to hold us over until then, but all in all it's only a mediocre effort that doesn't offer much than simply replaying the original.",A lesser version of the original,1090972800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},,surprised second interface move restart eastern much excessive detail effort i've think pattern work character somewhat way end notice like come splinter say thermal lax however graphic level way travel start simply puzzle someone fine world completely action time night area next last hold turn impressed performed get redesign several dark length instrument many due i'd engage limit coolest overwhelm sure installment great disappointed storyline weapon later locomotive amazing minute mine native geographic must navigate train real suppose interested involved middle find interesting unlike music wane scan read strategy little really that's one combine proportion orchestra surround offer new back feature original deal pass point try enemy sam see rather goggles circumnavigate quickly probably roll first game villains almost early cell spotlight climb theme game sucked cinematic particularly top sometimes level begin game felt amazingly area pandora suppose replay attention even see battle start stealth find time credit keep meter jerusalem sound incorporate side release main clipped field anti-climactic initially long feel speed story mediocre gameplay come though specific people go encourage eagerly well essentially year expect get another save ate anything tomorrow percussion compare indonesia recreate pretty
67,369519,2,True,"09 23, 2014",A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B00LH6CBA8,Joshua Glowzinski,"I played the beta of this.  It was interesting.  I think I could have used my player from the beta.  Oh well, fun to restart.  During the beta, the game really had nothing going on.  I told myself it was for the simple fact that I was playing the beta.  Well, I seem to have been wrong.  First some good things.  This is the best looking game I have ever seen.  It is amazing to watch.  Not just the cut scenes, everything is incredible.  The voice work, at least so far, seems really well done.  Everything controls well and feels great when playing.  It all runs very smoothly.  It is easy to figure out and learn everything you need to know.  Your character builds up their stats.  You can get more weapons, armor and other things, the stronger you get.  So, you have something to work towards.  Now for some bad stuff. This game seems to have absolutely nothing happening.  I mean, you go through the places and see characters, buildings and other things.  But, they seem to be there just to be there.  It reminded me of an MMORPG that was about to close its servers, one that had been around for a decade.  It was just a baron wasteland.  I felt kind of lonely.  Haha  I did see some other players running around, maybe five or so.  But, I am wondering what the point of all this is?  To have such a great game that has nothing going on is a shame.  On top of that, the enemy seems to be in a group, stuck with a tether, just standing there.  They do shoot at you.  But, they hardly ever come after you, or move at all.  You just run around alone, get some info, go to a place, shoot some bad guys, get back and do it all over again.  I just don't see how this is going to remain entertaining to me or anyone for a long period of time.  It reminds me of when I am playing a fps and I create a room for online play.  Well, I am just running around doing nothing until other players join.  That is exactly what this game feels like.  Right now, this is one of the few games I've purchased that I wish I had waited a while for.  BUT, when I woke up this morning, the first thing I thought of was this game.  I think it has to do with the building your character up.  I have other things to do today.  So I will not be playing this game.  But I am thinking about it.  I guess, it is just for the fact that I've been hearing so much about this game.  It just seems completely unfinished and empty.  I really cannot sell it now.  I've used the codes to get the stuff you get with this version.  Oh well, only time will let me know if this game ends up being worth the $99.99 price tag.  Right now, I would lean towards no.  Update. Ok, after playing this game for a while, I changed my review from a 3 out of 5 to a 2 out of 5.  The game just is not that fun.  It is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played.  You get a mission, go to the location, run around a completely empty location, get to a pint with a group of enemies that are all in one big clump, kill them, though, if they have a large number come at you at once, you die, when you kill them you go do something and complete the mission.  Every enemy, thus far, looks the same.  They have three or four main enemies.  Then they have the ones that float around.  It reminds me of two things.  An arcade game and a launch game.  After everything I had heard of this game, it was all bogus.  Such a boring game.  No real story or anything worth playing.  A complete waste of $99.99.  I tried playing the one part in which you play against people.  I can never find anyone on there and I just sit and sit while waiting.  I just quit and play the regular game.  Also, I never really see other people playing.  I just run around nothing.  Update 2: Ok, there is something interesting about this game from IGN.  It is kind of giving a reason that this game was so stripped down, has nothing going on and seems as if it is not complete.  If you want to read it, look on IGN.  I do not think Amazon wants me to post the link.

First of all, it puts me into a fantasy world of magic & sword fighting, which is right up my ally.  The storyline is fairly interesting.  The graphics are good & fun to watch & the scenery is beautiful, at times.  You can chose whether to play as a male or female.  You start out as a child, then the story skips ahead about 10 years to adulthood, when you start your quest.  One fun aspect is that you have a pet dog that travels with you on your journeys.  He finds treasures for you, warns you of danger, & even finishes off your enemies.  I'm sure some players will find him annoying but I liked it.  Your character is somewhat customizable.  You can change your hairstyle, hair color, & wardrobe & add facial hair or makeup.  You can have two weapons equipped at a time, a melee weapon (cutlass, katana, longsword, axe, cleaver, hammer, or mace) & a ranged weapon (light crossbow, heavy crossbow, repeater crossbow, clockwork rifle/pistol, blunderbuss, turret rifle, flintlock pistol, etc).  In the game, magic is referred to as ""Will.""  There are 8 spells you can learn.  As you gain experience, your spells become more powerful.  After playing it through once, I decided I really only needed one spell.  It gets a little confusing during a battle when you have multiple spells.  So, the next time I played it through, I only learned the Inferno (fireball) spell.  There are a series of expressions for you to learn with which you interact with the villagers.  Some expressions include laughing, dancing, growling, & seducing (I was a little surpised when I discovered condoms in the game).  If you get villagers to like you enough, they will give you gifts & even fall in love with you.  You can get married & have a family or, if you find a willing villager, just have a one night stand (but make sure to use a condom if you don't want a STD or babies).  You can purchase almost any house or store in the game & chose to rent them out for profit or live there.  Buying better furniture will improve the property's value.  You can make a fortune in rent if you have enough property.  There are also jobs (woodcutter, bartender, blacksmith, bounty hunter) that help you earn gold.  As you improve, the jobs become more difficult but you also earn more gold.  You can play with two players but the second player cannot play with their own character (unless you're playing online).  I had a free trial for Xbox Live, so I was able to play online, which isn't much different.  Other players are represented by a floating orb with their gamertag & avatar picture.  I'm sure it's probably more fun if you have friends that are playing but I didn't, so it was mostly annoying.  People trying to sell/buy weapons or beg money from you.

80,105154,3,False,"07 14, 2007",A2SYA663GK3EEJ,B000P8U2KA,Henry Jones,"Tellurye is going to break it down for you.  As owner of Fedora Technologies ([...]) we get access to lots of goodies.  I've had the chance to try this bad boy out immediately.  What stands our company out is, yes I give you my opinion, but I will also state facts - this helps the user decide on whether they want to buy it.  Not just ""its good"" or ""bad"".  So let me sum up.  STORY:  You are John Llyod, part of a Special Forces team set on a rainy night in LA taking out vampires (also called NightWalkers), rescuing a kidnapped professor from their hold, and unraveling the events behind how this Plague came to the city.  Just like other folks said, this is Splinter Cell like.  Although you CANNOT engage the vampires for the first third of the game.  (well, you can...we'll get to that in a minute)  They can run FAST, and kill within seconds (and the standard weapons do no good) so don't bother shooting or trying to outrun them and get to a hiding spot to ""lose"" them.  That won't happen here.  Think of this as Metal Gear Solid where you had to sneak much of the same amount of the game before you actually acquired a weapon.  Same thing here.  You are forced to think of alternate routes, watch their patrol pattern, to get to your objective.  GAMEPLAY:  Let me also clear up some of myths.  Vamps DO show up on radar, but not at first.  If moving slowly enough, they eventually show up on radar with their cone of vision as soon as they are on your screen, or if you go into Necro mode (like HeatVision, but vampires stand out differently than humans).  and lock on to them.  So, you have to engage Necro Vision, or hug a wall and rotate your camera around the corner for it to register.  Needless to say you have to proceed carefully.  You cannot run or walk fast throughout the level.  Don't take for granted that it's a dead end alley and no vampires will be standing there smoking - they will be.  This forces you to be 100% stealthy and look at EVERY corner before advancing.  Sounds annoying but it really wasn't.  Levels went by pretty easy for me.  Plus, this was VERY intense and suspenseful.  It did not take me forever, but it was realistic.  If you were really trying to sneak into a building, you wouldn't walk quickly up to it, you would look at every angle to see the best way in, make sure there weren't patrolling guards, etc.  You are given a warning - transparent white overlay of vampire eyes and an awesome sound let you know you are in danger of being seen.  The game is somewhat forgiving in even if you are somewhat close to them, it still gives you time to run back to get out of their line of sight.  Of course, you only have 5 seconds or so to do this.  If not, then it is over for you.  So its not like ""Ooop, he saw me, I'm dead"" unless you ran every where and don't have time to get out of their sight.  You can engage the enemy, but very unwise to do so, unless you have the sniper rifle or shotgun, which usually takes them down in one shot.  The other weapons you have, take roughly 15 - 20 bullets (not location specific) to bring them down.  This can be easy if they are on the same level as you, you are a good distance enough away from them to get all 15-20 rounds off, as they literally run right towards you - they don't do any defensive maneuvers.  However, if you are on a rooftop and they are on the ground (or vice versa) they will jump to get to you and it can be hard to hit them while flying or running left to right / strafing if obstacles are in their way.  Hence that's why its best to not engage them at all.  The guns that CAN kill the vampires are pretty cool.  However, you lose them by the time you get to the next level.  Pretty dumb.  I suppose this is a way the developers didn't want you blowing the two-thirds of the game thru in 15 minutes.  Games like this have been much criticized.  However, they could have done something more realistic, such as make ammo scarce so that you would have to survive on guns AND stealth.  Game does a great job with added suspense by dropping vampires in front of you with their back turned to you on purpose.  This scares the crap outta you, but they purposely don't ""see you"" unless you were running at the time, and they jump away.  This gives you that ""oh crap"" feeling like ""Man don't turn around"". But they never do - I think the developers just put that in there for fun to remind you, that vamps can travel via the rooftops, not just the streets.  The boss stages are almost too easy.  There is a difficulty setting that you can adjust.  That really only effects the bosses more so, since even on easy, you cannot engage the enemy in the first third.  The bosses are weird in that they take their sweet time reloading their weapon, or standing there.  The only challenge really are the regular vampires that you have to sneak by.  But, there is a boss or two that are challenging.  Almost as if the developers spent time on the nightwalkers, and blew off the boss stages.  The biggest problem with this game, is where there is a positive, there is almost a matching negative.  Almost a 1:1 ratio.  The game is pretty forgiving.  Even though these Vamps are super human, they can't see you thru fog or walls.  They explain the dense rain weakens their otherwise super human senses.  And when you get killed, you spawn near the checkpoint or when the last cutscene played, but NOT near the vamp or his/her line of sight.  So you don't respawn right in front of danger or in an impossible spot, nor do you have to spend another 10 - 15 minutes getting back to where you were.  Although, you may decide you do need to backtrack if you think ""hey, too many vampires, let's backtrack to that ladder and try taking the roof"".  The checkpoints did take a while to get to, but like I stated, the fact that you can ""continue"" makes it go by fast.  Although, this does subtract from your score.  But then again, so does selecting ""restart"", so there you have it.  Some sequences are scripted no matter what - A nightwalker will ""hear"" you even though you haven't moved a muscle and will begin to search for you.  Kind of sucks, but again, good cause then you only have about 30 seconds to find a hiding spot.  This does add to the suspense, but again, its forced.  This is extremely rare in the game, but does happen.  This unnecessarily adds to a painful trial-and-error game.  Along those lines, not much replay value, except online.  It is easy to memorize a level, if you wanted to do it again.  You can then run everywhere since you know where all the baddies are.  However, there are multiple paths to get to your objective in the single-player game, and I enjoyed finding quicker rooftop paths, or longer but more visually appealing choices.  But, with no different unlockables due to a great score, there is little reason to do so.  Multiplayer is fun with Deathmatch, Death or Nightwalker, destroy or capture the flag.  However, there is no co-op mode for the mission.  Nothing really to shout about here.  GRAPHICS:  The graphics here are nothing to brag about.  The environments were very detailed and nice, but not as good lookin as Gears of War or Splinter Cell, but I thought definitely better than PS2 quality.  They look believable and are detailed environments.  Not just similar empty rooms.  However, the rain (which persists throughout the entire game) IS PHENOMENAL!  The way it glistens and stands on the rooftops, streets, cars, and even the characters are incredible - really pushed the 360 to its max in this area.  The intro and cutscenes are awesomely done - very movie-like.  The plot seems a little weird.  And the voice acting - even worse.  Questions are answered but may not tie all the action together (why did I have to travel rooftops and climb fences to go to that building again...if you have a VAN?.  And why backtrack through an early level - shouldn't you have ordered me to do that BEFORE we took the house?)  SOUND:  The music that accompanies the game, while I usually turn this off, does a good job to let you know when danger is approaching, or as you dive deeper into surreal, seedy environments.  The ""woosh"" sound and music that is played, as your controller vibrates when an enemy spots you really sends chills up your spine.  Even if you don't swear when you are scared, you will playing this game, and not just out of frustration either.  I would recommend, based on polls from folks and reading their posts, that you download the demo (not in US yet, but you can easily make a Japanese or UK account on XBL in minutes - that's what I did, and download from there), rent it, or borrow from a friend and see for yourself.  I LOVE games like this, but even I wouldn't pay $60 for it.  I'd wait till it drops to about $40.  It has its ups and downs - you die fast, yet respawn in a great spot; regular vamps are tough, bosses are laughably easy; finally get a weapon, only to lose it on the next level.  I think you see where I'm going with this.  This game showed great promise, but feels rushed out the door.  If you like a little faster paced like Splinter Cell or MGS, then I'd stay away from this one for a while.  However, if you like taking your time, really looking at the level and absorbing all the environments, and proceed methodically, then this may be up your alley.  Either way, I would rent or demo it before shelling out the 60 Washington's.

One game I missed out on back then was Chrono Trigger.  I'm not sure why it slipped under my radar, but for whatever reason I never purchased or rented the game until now.  And boy, did I miss out.  Chrono Trigger is a wonderful game.  Compelling storyline, great graphics, and interesting characters.  The battles are a pleasure, and those that disliked the random encounters of the Final Fantasy series will probably appreciate the battles in Chrono Trigger that much more.

96,105311,4,False,"12 27, 2007",A2290OIJTU42QP,B000PE0HCM,Female Spy,"My Sims can be a fun game.  Whether or not it's for you will depend on quite a few things, however.  Anyone who doesn't like Animal Crossing had better leave now, because this game is practically the spitting image of it (save for the facts that it's simpler, and you're communicating with humanish sims instead of animals).  Here are the cons and pros; read them carefully before you decide on this purchase.  Cons:  1.  I can see where the game has been geared for little kids.  It's pretty basic and quite easy.  If you're looking for a challenge that will make you pull your hair out, then I don't see you enjoying this game.  2.  Can be repetitious.  You may find one minigame you're good at, and play it over and over when you need money.  That can be annoying.  Also, you're normally stuck talking to tourists and moody shop owners, and sometimes they're aggravating.  3.  The fishing system is flawed.  The instructions teach you the controls, but nothing else.  If you move the float, it plays music and I don't know why, or even how you use it; simply because it doesn't explain that part in the directions.  If you are lucky enough to get a fish interested, then you still probably won't catch one.  I tap on the float like mad trying to pull the fish up; but it usually takes too long, and I come up short.  Bottom line is, Animal Crossing's fishing system is much better developed; and, unfortunately, fishing is a small part of My Sims.  4.  I don't think the sim's speech was fully translated, but I'm not sure.  After you finish cheering up people with the seven expressions (laugh, converse, listen, get angry, cry, encourage, and comfort) they talk in a language you can't understand for a short while.  Maybe it's just muttering and meant to be cute; but if it's untranslated Japanese, it shows developers didn't work very hard on the game.  Personally, I like understanding everything people say, so this can be a bummer; even though it's cute to watch the sims converse.  5.  Some of the minigames don't function well, but that could just be my opinion.  I can't do anything with raquetball, because it seems that the controls are flawed there too; as you can't manipulate the ball like you should.  Pros:  1.  The game's design is pretty good.  It's pretty, and you can customize your character at the game's start.  It's not a huge selection, but you can buy more clothes and furniture.  Overall, it's just pretty; not exceptional, but pretty.  2.  Most of the mini games are entertaining.  I enjoy making leis and I make a lot of money off of them.  Paragliding is fun, Tic Tac Trump is fun, and even Racquetball is fun if you can withstand the control flaws.  3.  Most of the sims are lovable characters.  There's only one sim out of about twenty who I loathe.  In Animal Crossing, the neighbors are easier to hate than to love...  4.  It's addictive...  Maybe it's too simple, and the principles aren't completely in place; but the game manages to hold my attention for a while each time I play.  It's fun to charm the tourists if they take to you kindly.  5.  The storage systems are better.  In Animal Crossing, one of the things I despised was that there were so many clothes that looked good on me; but finding room for them was murder.  Same goes with furniture, stationary, wallpaper, carpeting, and even knicknacks you carry around with you all of the time.  In this game, you can buy as much stuff as you want, without crowding your house.  There's still a limit on how many pieces of furniture you can put in your room, but it's a pretty lenient limit.  You have so many pockets on your person, that even the biggest pack rats can travel comfortably.  If you run out of space on your person, there's even more room in you're chests!  I think that's all I have to say.  This game has many pleasant surprises that I haven't even touched on this review; but these are the main points in a nutshell.  If you want something that will entertain the younger, and relax the older, this game is for you.  The bottom line, however, is that this game is a lot like that Chinese cake that the chef eventually makes; either you will taste it and love it, or you will taste it and never want to see another videogame again.",Is My Sims for you?

Even if you had to buy a PSP or Nintendo DS to go along with it, it would still be pretty good.  The grammar lessons cover a lot of what you would in perhaps 2 semesters of college, but they don't really quiz on it much.  What this game really does is teach vocabulary.  A LOT of vocabulary... something like 8000 words.  The games are all pretty effective at getting words in memory, and you can have the software quiz you over what you've learned.  Each word is pronounced for you, and it has a handy dictionary.  I've used Pimsluer and Rosetta Stone, and those are both very good at teaching how Spanish functions, but this software has both those beat in terms of teaching you vocabulary fast (but this stuff doesn't do much more than teach you thousands of words).  And at less than a tenth the price.  There are several different games.  Memory, flashcards, etc.  The lessons go over some basic grammar rules and ten or so words, and have two games you must master to advance.  Eventually you're just learning words each lesson from an animated janitor (apparently).  The music and animated woman are corny, but I don't really care.  Loading times on the PSP are fair at best, but it's not a big deal.  The 'smack the gopher' game takes a lot of practice to get good at, but as a side benefit I'm much better at other PSP games now that I've mastered the PSP stick.  There are a few errors... sometimes the audio will now match the text (for example, a 'de' will be dropped from a sentence where it's not necessary).  I've noticed about ten of these errors out of over 900 lessons... basically as many errors as a well edited textbook probably has.  This software teaches Latin American Spanish... and while the verb charts cover Vosotros, the quizzes ignore it.  This is pretty standard.  Bottom line: you can learn Spanish with this and any old Spanish textbook.  If you master both you will have a superior vocabulary than many students who have undergone several semesters of study.

128,212629,5,False,"01 31, 2012",A3R9NUZTNBPDNZ,B003O6EBRA,Athlete,"FF XIII-2 continues three years after the first game left off. You assume the role of Serah, who now lives on a settlement on Gran Pulse. She's recently been having dreams where her big sister (and FF XIII main heroine) Lightning fights a mysterious foe in a place called Valhalla. She wakes up one night to discover that a meteorite has crashed down nearby, bringing with it a boy, Noel, who claims to be the last survivor of humanity from a far future. Noel has met with Lightning and was sent to Serah, he says, because the two of them must take a time-travelling adventure to unwind a paradox-filled history -- and that's exactly what they do.  The time-travel element may remind some players of Square classic Chrono Trigger, and the comparison isn't terribly far off. Serah and Noel hop around different eras and locations in the world's history, solving problems and opening portals to other eras and potential futures. Though parts of the story are still linear, you're given far more freedom to approach challenges in a way you personally enjoy. Don't feel like advancing the main plot at this time? Boss fight giving you trouble? Just hop to a different time period to explore and build strength for a while until you're content. Unlike the ""series of tubes"" that comprised most of FF XIII's structure up until later in the game, FF XIII-2 lets you progress at your own pace. With that freedom comes the sense of excitement and discovery that FF XIII sorely lacked, as finding hidden treasures and using clever strategy to topple monsters well above your strength level feels immensely satisfying. And if you ever feel like you might have missed something, you can rewind back to the beginning of certain event sequences to do things over while retaining your hard-earned rewards.  Not everything here is new, however. You'll see a lot of familiar locales, tunes, and designs from FF XIII peppered in-between all-new content. The recycling of some assets can be easily forgiven, however, when what's being reused was beautiful and well-made to begin with. Also returning is FF XIII's superb, fast-paced combat engine and the accompanying Crystarium leveling system, albeit with some significant overhauls. You now have more control over character development, as you can choose to level up specific Paradigm roles on the Crystarium board (as in FF XIII) while also unlocking additional roles and bonus boosts (stat gains, accessory capacity) after reaching certain levels. Moreover, battles continue on even after the initial player-controlled party leader has fallen, giving you a chance to regroup and make a comeback.  It's easy to see how Square Enix took the feedback from FF XIII and used it to make a better product, but this follow-up still has some lingering issues. Every so often you'll encounter an obnoxious gimmick sequence, such as a giant time-jumping fetch quest, a series of out-of-place logic puzzles, or constantly regenerating and unavoidable Cie'th enemy hordes chasing you throughout a massive maze. Plus, the story falters at times, falling victim to leaps of logic and silliness, and dialogue exchanges often feel like characters are simply talking at each other rather than truly interacting. The trademark Square Enix CG is sparse, with most story sequences rendered in-engine. But perhaps most annoying are the technical issues: framerates drop precipitously when a lot is happening onscreen, and this sequel's few movie sequences frequently suffer from hideously artifacted compression.  Maybe the best way to sum up Final Fantasy XIII-2 is with an oft-repeated line of dialogue from the game itself: ""Change the future to change the past."" It's not just a paradoxical plot point: FFXIII-2 repairs almost every problem with Final Fantasy XIII, delivering an experience that feels like what that original game should have been. If your faith in Final Fantasy has been damaged by past disappointment, playing FFXIII-2 will restore your excitement for the franchise's future.",Great Sequel,1327968000,38.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,combat capacity maybe event heroine sum ever approach player fetch meteorite location topple compression time last problem wake open disappointment level different later monster solve victim role time-jumping trigger comprise enemy framerates damage annoy original point far nearby explore immensely continue unlock chrono almost boost paradox-filled find let settlement sequence excitement everything familiar potential restore giant easily quest hidden portal experience main plus repair regroup fantasy superb constantly unwind life two silliness out-of-place system pepper call board boy fight every may chase exchange character enjoy plot valhalla like element humanity pace level development freedom puzzle character might product in-engine follow-up obnoxious deliver reach reward claim paradoxical problem trouble franchise's accessory fall well happen horde technical one fight personally role new future bonus reuse hard-earned gimmick player-controlled first certain overhaul well-made time history give issue game also still see ff remind year drop choose build play classic story survivor battle though eras lack comparison crash treasure use three exactly give moreover cie'th rather paradigm additional satisfying sequence however cg simply clever stat asset night render locales falter take change faith big maze serah initial structure must sister in-between enix crystarium leave xiii strategy thing forgiven frequently meet series lot rewind back tubes regenerate place sense beautiful adventure take use sorely talk come recycle design perhaps what's part bos level strength period discover recently send challenge make begin continue lightning best hideously often trademark specific throughout assume well onscreen final sequel's noel control all-new sparse chance comeback mysterious way movie accompany significant time-travel fall linger linear something feel terribly feel begin albeit logic discovery artifacted unlike line tune hop that's retain square bring oft-repeated engine dialogue truly world's unavoidable leap gain return dream fast-paced miss even gran easy precipitously feedback advance xiii's leader say massive encounter time-travelling around progress content party future suffer past pulse interacting foe

The game gives you enough tools that you can get through huge chunks of the game more or less non-violently, which is neat in a genre which always has heavy doses of violence and gun action. The hacking is pretty fun and sets the game apart (I heard this was not the case in the first title). The game is also quite light-hearted and irreverent, far different from the grim spirit and mean sarcasm of recent GTA titles. I do think, though, that the tone can be off-putting to some people, as it seems to skew younger than most games. WD2 doesn't take itself too seriously but a lot of the dialogue is good enough. The game also looks great, taking place in a very good representation of San Francisco and the Bay Area. I've spent a good deal of time there over the years and can say it nails the look and feel pretty well. WD2 pops with color and it helps give the game a more playful feel. I happened to play the game on a PS4 Pro, and it looks great and runs well. I can't speak to how it runs on a regular system as I bought it for the Pro support.  On the ground, it does play fairly similarly to GTA games - escape from cops, collect widgets, buy clothes, steal cars, get money, do missions, etc., but I think it does just enough to set it apart from those titles.

Why did I only play multiplayer?  Simply because I find that most single player (campaign) modes in FPS games (especially Modern Warfare shooters) follow simliar storylines and they are rarely worth any sort of hands on review.  Show some screenshots and you have pretty much covered it.  Other than maybe frame-rate and other bugs or issues, of course.  That said.  This game is a fun one to pop in and dive into an online skirmish.  It will irritate many people because of the incessant camping that takes place.  However, many of these things can be easily overcome with teamwork.  While I do realize that teamwork and online team deathmatch shooters don't really go hand-in-hand you should really give it a shot, lest you get spawn camped for an entire round.  If you are a MW2 or BFBC2 fan (or fanboy) you will fall into a gray area with this game.  There are kill-streak rewards and a run and gun attitude among many of the early adopters of this game (as of 10/13/10) which will please MW2 fans.  Also present (by default) is the R3 Click To Stab button instead of BFBC2's RB Button.  As for the BFBC2 Fans, the gunplay is a bit toned down from Bad Company 2's crazy realistic recoil action.  However, I have had minor problems getting a feel for sniper rifles.  Is there 'bullet drop'?  Do my bullets disappear?  Whatever it is that was happening to me last night I had to quit trying to snipe and stick with assault rifles.  I can't guarantee anyone will love this game and call it their favorite of all-time.  I think it is more of a game you will want to find for a decent price pre-owned.

What we have here is a 2D fighter on the XBOX with some remarkable realistic graphics and movements.  The animation and movements of the fighters is almost lifelike, and the power of the XBOX is utilized in ways to make fabric move convincingly and so on.  It's amazing that 2D fight fans will salivate over a new 16-bit Neo Geo fighter (beleive it or not, they are still releasing games for that system!) yet will completely overlook Kabuki Warriors.  The backgrounds are nice too with some clean 3D polygonal effects thrown in for good measure.  Any problems so far?  Yes.  There seems to be too many variations of just one character and you won't see any of the more spectacular ones until later in the game.  The default character that you'll see more often than not is just a boring guy painted in a shade of white who fights with chinese stick weapons.  Also, the backgrounds are kinda boring...but this is intended as Kabuki is a type of stage art very popular in Japan. The game consists of a tour mode and a time attck mode.  The tour mode is cool in that you need to earn money to progress to the goal.  You earn money by quick, clean victories and for posing and winning the crowd during the fight.  After a fight you can trade one fighter to get the best mix of weapon and styles for the fight ahead.  The game really picks up when you get some of the characters who fight with the various swords...some insane fun can be had with the usual combos and air juggles you can pull off with these guys! How does it play?  Imagine Killer Instinct-style gameplay where moves and combos can be strung together with simple button presses.  Persevere and learn the combo system and you have yourself a competent fighting game.  If you just mash the buttons and jump around hoping for random victories, then you'll get less out of this game. The bottomline:  If you enjoy 2D fighting games and you like learning the combo and timing system, then this is definitely a reasonably priced game for you.

162,181897,4,False,"09 11, 2009",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B001O2J036,Lisa Shea,"A first-person shooter that uses Time Travel as its main gimmick, Darkest of Days is a solid game with a lot of potential that never quite gets around to really exploring it.  The game casts you as one of General Custer's cavalrymen at Little Bighorn. After the famous ambush is sprung and your fellows are cut down, an armored soldier bursts from a time portal and rescues you from certain death. Erased from history and saved from your fate, your role becomes that of a time policeman. In the actual game, this means you alternate between going back between two main time periods: the Eastern Front of World War I, and the Battle of Antietam in the American Civil War. There isn't really a far-reaching time travel aspect; those time periods are basically all you get to see.  The game's gunplay handles pretty well. You use a lot of period weaponry to maintain your disguise as a denizen of that time; in the Civil War, you're using muskets and revolvers, while in World War 1 you have more powerful bolt-action rifles. However, you also have the option of using future weapons, when you can get them; the rarity of these weapons shows their power, as an assault rifle or shotgun can make a battle much easier than it would normally be. Oddly, though, nobody ever notices you using these weapons, which makes one wonder why the Time Police bother to send you in the past with historically accurate weapons.  Your mission objectives range from the linear (""go forward, attack enemies at this location"") to the open-ended (""sneak around and plant locator beacons in a German camp""). The game does a good job with atmospheric stuff; forests and cornfields are dense and give feelings of being in a tightly-enclosed area where enemy attacks can happen at any moment. The actual battles are pretty cover-intensive, too, primarily when you have primitive weapons. Using Civil War-era guns means that you have to reload very often (after every shot in the case of muskets), so finding cover is an important part of the game. There is an active reload system similar to Gears of War that allows for faster reloading (and your gun jams if you screw it up), so reloading isn't entirely tedious.  One of the only Time Travel-related gameplay points is the existence of Important People. These are otherwise normal enemies who have blue auras around them; this aura means that killing them will upset the timestream, and therefore you must shoot to wound (hitting either the arms or legs). If you avoid killing these people, then you will end up with more upgrade points to increase weapon stats. However, if you do kill those people, rival time-travelers will use the distortion of time to find you and try to kill you. Killing these enemies, though, will allow you to take their futuristic weapons for your own use. Therefore, if you're in a pinch, they can serve both as a handy armory and a nasty enemy.  The graphics are okay, but not great. They look a few years outdated, but not in such an obnoxious way as to detract from the game as a whole. The sound is pretty good in some respects (gunshot noises, environmental noises) and not so great in others (voice acting).  On the whole, Darkest of Days is a decent game - not great, not revolutionary, but pretty well made overall. The time travel thing doesn't get used as much as it ought to, but it provides some interesting levels, at least. The most annoying part of the game, though, was the fact that before and after every mission you're trapped in an unskippable cutscene where a computer screen talks at you. These sequences, reminiscent of similar ones in Half Life 2, belied the fact that the story was actually pretty one-dimensional, and mission briefings were unimportant due to the fact that your map just tells you where to go and what to do.  As a whole, Darkest of Days gets a 7/10.","A lot of potential, doesn't quite reach it",1252627200,18.0,{'Platform:': ' PC'},,power weaponry save ever revolver powerful gunshot reload nobody actually try one get weapon notice point upgrade allow thing atmospheric range provide really enemy entirely part unskippable annoy attack cut easy objective primarily kill stuff fellow find screen would actual forest explore potential arm futuristic burst sound tedious reload show main either ought overall two gameplay system wind primitive go police soldier every give send much travel-related tightly-enclosed stats shoot graphic normal normally obnoxious due cavalryman gun alternate far-reaching one death cornfield briefing role future increase make whole option reminiscent one-dimensional gimmick day accurate portal certain time rarity history general game also decent maintain voice see year rifle game's case bother moment serve gear time-travelers map story german though battle allows use antietam eastern use assault sequence however mission travel half nasty darkest others job area war least plant aspect important location open-ended beacon tell take wonder camp mean must fate cutscene interesting little faster outdated attack erase lot distortion back american existence spring similar enemy act good use bighorn bolt-action unimportant active civil level musket historically period front rescue dense make aura avoid policeman revolutionary cover-intensive often look life screw happen well get kill talk war-era cast jam find quite shot way feeling disguise handy upset world linear weapon respect solid great shotgun first-person trap therefore denizen timestream detract fact computer go environmental belie gun otherwise custer's sneak aura blue locator gunplay noise battle basically shooter forward armor never around becomes rival okay cover end make armory handle people famous rifle ambush oddly hit past leg period us pretty pinch

The Incredible Hulk is a free-roaming tie-in to the movie of the same name starring Edward Norton, and not surprisingly, it's not one of the better games out there. Still, it's certainly not the worst game out there either; I've seen much worse, like the game based on the Iron Man movie. Boy, what a stinker. Anyway, this game follows the story of the movie, but of course adds a bunch of other story elements, characters, and villains. Aside from the Abomination, General Thunderbolt Ross, and Betty Ross, this game also includes the U-Foes, Bi-Beast, the Enclave, and Rick Jones. The story that follows the movie's story doesn't offer any big surprises, and frankly neither do the other stories involving the extra villains previously mentioned, but they are definitely more interesting. Dealing with the Enclave in particular will take up the lion's share of your playtime, even after you've finished the main quest. There are four main Enclave leaders who control four different sectors of the Enclave, and the city of New York is split into four quadrants with one of the main headquarters located in each quadrant, which can only be found after defeating a set number of Enclave minions, robots, and ships. Besides them, the Hulk will face off against the military, their mechs, and Hulkbusters (which look a lot like the Iron Man Hulkbuster). You'll face them in regular missions and they'll attack you if you damage too much of the city as you stomp through it. Also, after initially defeating bosses like the U-Foes, you'll have random encounters with one or two of them at a time later on (there are four U-Foes in all). It's actually possible to encounter U-Foes, the Enclave, or the military battling each other, but once they see the Hulk, they'll ignore each other and all go after the poor green monster.  The Hulk controls in much of the same way he did in Ultimate Destruction. He jumps super high and runs super fast, and he can use devastating ground smashes and thunderclaps on large groups of enemies. He no longer runs up the sides of buildings, but climbs up them rather quickly (the climbing is still slower than running, but it's also more realistic). He has a rage meter, and once it's full, he can use it up to either destroy his enemies with a super ground smash or super thunderclap, or he can use this energy to heal himself, which can save you from certain death. Well, that's everything good about this game, now let's discuss what the game doesn't do so well. Most of the regular enemies the Hulk fights in this game aren't very challenging, but at least some of the bosses are. However, certain bosses, like one particular Hulkbuster and the Abomination, are very difficult, and not in a good way. Only one or two of the Hulk's regular attacks work on them, aside from his rage attacks, requiring you to perform the same attack over and over again until you whittle their health down to zero; that's just cheap and poor game programming. Unlike Ultimate Destruction, which only let you destroy mission specific buildings and structures, the entirety of New York in this game is fully destructible. A cool thing (which is actually a goal in one of the many silly side missions) is that the Hulk can throw cars and trucks at buildings and they'll actually get driven into the walls, instead of simply blowing up. Unfortunately, things in this game are just TOO destructible. Thanks to a noticeable design flaw, the Hulk only has to go within a few feet of things like streetlights and cars and they get knocked aside as if he plowed directly into them. Talk about a bull in a very large china shop. Plus, as previously mentioned, destroying too much of the environment attracts the military, so it can get annoying having them chase you all the time because you knocked over a few hot dog stands and satellite dishes as you run and jump through the city. Certain enemies, mostly the giant robots, don't even react if Hulk strikes them with an air dash. They don't even stumble back, they just stand there and Hulk seems to slide off them, but at least their health still goes down. The game's graphics are more detailed and realistic than Ultimate Destruction, but the game is on the PS3 as opposed to the PS2. Still, there are other free-roaming games out there with better graphics overall. In this game, the environments are kind of bland, as are the human characters (Bruce Banner, Betty Ross, General Ross, etc.). Plus, the Hulk's super attacks appear much less powerful in this game, and the sound effects seem like an afterthought, especially when the Hulk trades blows with other enemies; you hardly hear the punches landing. The voice acting kind of sucks too. So yeah, this game is a rental at best for most gamers.

It didn't get great reviews, but it looked fun to me, and I bought it for my kids---well, it's been played far more than any of the other (too many) video games we have!  There are 3 basic modes---a standard racing mode, a overhead view racing mode and City Mode, which takes more explaining!  The standard mode uses Kirbys riding on different vehicles, going VERY fast on different kinds of courses.  Kirby can eat enemies and take their powers for a while.  You can race each other, or the computer.  All you really do is steer and slow down in order to power up for a boost.  It's very simple to control Kirby, and you get a great feeling of being half out of control while still in control!  The overhead mode is kind of retro looking.  You race a little Kirby around and around a small track (there are several different ones).  The track looks like those little car tracks from the 70s.  There are bonus items you can eat up as you race, some boost you, some hurt others.  The City Mode is what we play the most.  It's WEIRD but fun!  It's a city full of odd things---a section of trees, a section of run down buildings, a waterwheel, a castle, a subway, lots of underground areas---all sort of minimalistically portrayed!  The real goal is to break open all kinds of boxes and get power up items, like better turning or better speed.  In the standard mode, you have 5 minutes to do this.  You can find different vehicles lying around, and ride them instead of your starting one.  Then, after the 5 minutes, you compete in a random pick of one of 20 or so stadium events---a  long jump, a race, a melee match, etc.  It's fun as you might have collected items for a race, which do you no good in what you are actually doing, so all have a chance!  The most fun of this game is trying to finish the grids with records!  There are a huge 128 boxes to fill in for EACH mode!  Some are things like getting a certain score, but others are out there, like finishing with your time all a certain number on the seconds!  We haven't filled all the boxes in any of the modes yet!

177,198613,4,False,"12 16, 2009",A26G35WR7QCFR2,B002BUELA2,Kevin R. Haughn,"I just assumed that LEGO Indiana Jones (LIJ) 2 would be more of the same from the first title.  However, due to the high price for LIJ2, I figured out the new feature that was all the buzz: players can create their own levels.  Also, there were elements from each of the four Indiana Jones movies in this LIJ2 package.  So in a sense, the higher price indicates that there is more play in LIJ2 than in LIJ1.  Now that I own the game and have played it extensively, I thought I'd tell you about it.  First off, the price will come down, but not until after the holidays.  Is LIJ2 worth $30?  I think it is worth $20-$25; so if you find it in that range, then you are doing alright.  Of course, if paying $3-$10 more doesn't really concern you, then don't worry about it.  Next, what is different.  The first LIJ was from the now-classic mold of LEGO movie games, especially reminiscent of the LEGO Star Wars series.  Basically, if you didn't know, the LEGO Batman, Indiana Jones, and Star Wars games are super awesome for a wide range of players over the ages of 9.  The game play is simple: with a game controller, you only use four buttons to play in the Story Mode (which mimics the movie plots to a large degree), and five buttons when doing the Free Play mode.  The story settings are wonderfully crafted with the computer graphics and really bring to life that sense of engaging within the movie yourself, albeit with little, humorous, plastic LEGO characters.  These LEGO games have been great.  How does LEGO Indiana Jones 2 compare, then?  LIJ2 does not come from the mold of those previously mentioned now-classic video games.  However, I think that LIJ2 is developing a new sub-genre that could be a classic in and of itself.  That is, I live to play video games that I can customize.  While I love also playing video games that let me interact in movie stories that I have always loved, I love also being able to contour my gaming experience when I can.  LIJ2 breaks from this LEGO video game mold in that LIJ2 is really just based on the concept of customization - it is not a mimicker of the movies that we watched and loved.  Instead, this game focuses more on the Creator Mode, and the levels you play that are based on the four Indiana Jones movies are really just preparation for when you get to the Creator Mode.  You will notice that all the levels in this game are based around simple, universal concepts, similar to the previous LEGO titles, but different.  Examples: Indy's whip pulls hooks and bad guys; bottles of water put out fire; rockets and grenades blow up metal; swords cut ropes; etcetera.  The point is that each of the LIJ2 levels are designed around these simple concepts.  So what's new in the LEGO franchise, then?  Well, LIJ2, like I said, is really just prepping the player as he/she goes through the pre-designed levels (based on the four movies) so that when they attempt the Creator Mode, the player can put all that knowledge to use.  Therefore, as aforementioned, LIJ2 is squarely focused on the Creator Mode, which is the customization feature of this game.  The levels just prepare you for that, utilizing familiar characters from the Indiana Jones world (over 60 characters and vehicles) and some familiar movie story plots (though not many).  As for graphics and game play in LIJ2, I would say that there have been some improvements over the previous mold, as I call it, though nothing earth-shaking.  What takes time to get used to - and you don't always have time in these types of action games - is utilizing weapons or tools that need to be aimed.  For example, when Indy needs to hook onto something with his whip, you need to actually hold down the button, target the object, and then let 'er fly.  If you recall from the previous LIJ, you simply put the whip out there by hitting the button, and he'd grab it.  Of course, now the whip does other things, such as tying down bad guys (so that they are immobile) and doing multiple, consecutive whip swings.  They can even damage other characters, though only at close range.  There is no longer long-range whip damage to be dealt.  The other graphics to mention are the playable levels.  You will notice some similarities to the levels of the previous LIJ, though the interactions will be different, and there will be subtle differences and nuances.  In all, the levels look superb, whether you are engaging in what I call the 'world plots' (the central locations for each movie that are effectively islands with various terrain to exemplify the movie locations and have side quests) or the 'level plots' (the places you go into from the 'world plot' to perform the various  required quests).  The terrain and water always look beautiful, and using the various instruments around the places are always fun and engaging.  But on that note...  Utilizing the vehicles in LIJ2 is a nightmare, I believe.  That seems to be the only shortcoming of this game, I am afraid to admit.  Basically, the ground vehicles travel at a very fast rate.  This would be fine if the handling were much better or if the rate could be altered instead of tapping the breaks constantly or taking your thumb off the directional stick/pad.  What ends up happening is that flipping over in the land vehicles is all too easy.  It becomes exceedingly frustrating, especially when time is of the essence in completing certain missions.  And that, then, becomes the underlying problem with this game, unfortunately: there are so many missions that require driving land vehicles!  There is at least one for each in the movie levels.  Imagine: you are driving to get somewhere (or away from somewhere), and then you need to quickly turn to the left.  You will roll over and become cannon fodder - a sitting duck - way too easily.  Then, the rebounding time is long enough that you dread it, especially when you roll over several times, which is easy to do.  This is the one reason why I gave this game a 4-Star rating instead of 5 stars: the land vehicles problem.  I say, either slow them down do that turning is simpler, or otherwise eliminate the tipping over issue.  If there weren't so many land vehicle missions, I'd probably be able to overlook them, but alas, they are quite prevalent.  Other than the land vehicles, the water and air vehicles have their issues as well, though not quite so bad.  For the water vehicles, which are predominantly used in the 'world plots,' as I call them, they move somewhat slowly but have very poor handling.  You can't turn these things around without wasting a lot of time.  And that submarine will drive you crazy when you get it stuck at the bottom of a rock face ridge.  The airplanes provide the best graphical displays, in my opinion (I yearn to fly a real plain for the very reason that I could see everything below me), and they handle the best out of the vehicles.  However, they still require some getting used to.  In all, the vehicles in LIJ2 are what let me down, even though they are cool just for existing and able to be used.  They look really great!  They just move like crap!  I think the game designers wanted to instill a sense of realism in the physics of these vehicles, which is why they are subject to things like tipping over (when making hard turns at fast speeds) and slow movements (as when on the water).  And I suppose that Indiana Jones never had access to The Force, so I suppose he was more bound to reality.  But as a gamer, I think it is wiser that my games should frustrate me less.  If they want to make a game based on the physical realities of driving a truck or commanding a ship, then that should be sold separately.  As it sits now, I just want to play LIJ2 and get my ship to collect those Studs in less than 10 minutes.  Anyway, moving along, I would like to mention that the scenes from the movies are well replicated, and you will especially enjoy the Crystal Skull concepts that you haven't seen before in a video game.  Just beware, the story lines in LIJ2 are not what they are in the first three movies!  Crystal Skull is the only one that is more closely replicated here.  The last topic I'd like to discuss is the general game concept of LIJ2, especially in comparison to the first title.  As with the previous mold, where collecting Red Blocks (in LIJ1, for example, these were packages that were discovered and mailed back to Barnett College for Indy to open later) enabled special game play attributes, LIJ2 goes above and beyond.  Now you can collect Red, Green, and Blue blocks.  And given that four movies are represented here, that is a lot of additional game features!  I won't give any of them away, but if you are familiar with the other LEGO video games, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect, or will at least be familiar with most of them.  Also, the idea of traveling between terrains in the 'world plots' is an interesting thing.  Say, for example, that Indy goes to the snowy region of Tibet or the jungle region of India in the same movie, such as in Temple of Doom.  Well, the 'world plot' for Temple of Doom is this large island with both terrains connected by a bridge!  But you do get the sense of coming down the mountain, as it were, and into the jungle based on the graphics.  This is one way that the developers crammed all that good stuff into one movie's 'world.'  And that is where your players can interact, similar to Barnett College in LIJ1 or the diner in LEGO Star Wars 1.  But in LIJ2, these transition points are actually rolled up into this island 'world,' and there is much to discover here!  It would be like going to Barnett College and breaking things and digging things up in order to find Red Blocks.  The difference in LIJ2, then, is that you have to travel all around the desert, a jungle island, and a German military installation (as in Raiders of the Lost Ark) looking for them.  This as opposed to, say, traveling around Barnett College from room to room just looking for more Studs to collect.  So I think that LEGO Indiana Jones 2 really brings out a lot of great concepts that we have not seen before, and they are very good ones.  (Except for the plethora of vehicle interactions.)  This game last longer than the other LEGO titles (except for LSW: Complete Saga) and brings out that discovery bug that we all seem to have.  Once you get the hang of things, you will know what to look for when trying to find something, but LIJ2 still gives you plenty to work towards until being able to progress further in the game.  Also, there are new character interactions that you were not expecting, similar to playing LEGO Batman all the way through and finally realizing that you needed the Joker just to get that one Treasure Chest!  So for $20-$25, I'd say that it is worth its weight, especially given the Creator Mode that I will not discuss here.  (Because Creator Mode is the hallmark feature of this game, I will leave it as something for you to discover.  Just know that if you saw it in the game levels, you will be able to put it into your own levels!)  To close, I recommend LEGO Indiana Jones 2 for kids 12 and up.  The previous LEGO games could work for kids ages 9 and up, though mostly just for the Story Modes.  LIJ2 is more complicated, and because it is not based too closely on the movies for the most part, a kid younger than 12 might get bored by the complex requirements for getting to that cherished 100% completion mark.  Even in Story Mode for LIJ2, I think that most kids under age 12 will be challenged greater than in the previous mold.  But if your kid likes to tinker and can sit for hours without throwing game controllers, maybe he/she can enjoy this game fully.  But to get the most bang for your buck, this really is a sixth-graders game.

Also like I mentioned, you have to fight a lot in this game (both melee and with guns), and basically anything can be used as a weapon. This means 2x4 boards, lead pipes, rifles, handguns, small locker doors, SMGs, fire pokers, axes, shotguns, and many more (all these weapons can be used to block enemy attacks as well). You battle it out with a lot of freaky and odd enemies... some look like simple whacked out hobos, others look like anorexic zombies, some are big & intimadating, others look like the Toxic Avenger. What was cool is if you beat them enough, you can grab them and smash their heads into the floor, headbutt them, or break their necks - scoring an instant kill. Oh and one more thing - you get a taser that you can shoot and disarm enemies...very useful.  The enemy AI was really good & impressive. They grab weapons off the floor or out of walls (conduits and pipes), block some of your melee attacks, take cover, and even go as far as to hide from you and pretend they are Mannequins in one stage. Additionally, if one enemy accidently hits another, they actually start to fight each other.  Theres some things to collect such as dead birds and metal pieces.. each time you collect one you gain an ""achievement"" in Xbox live..so yeah. As for the ending and unlocking anything, it doesn't.  The only two reasons this game has a learning curve is because you need to learn when to time your blocks, and to get used to the fact that whatever ammo you have in a gun is the only ammo you get for it. Thats right, you get no ammo. So lets say you have a shotgun with 2 rounds, thats all you will get for that gun until you get a different weapon or pick up a different shotgun.. it was sorta lame, but definitley helped in the challenge.  This game's difficulty varied. At some points it is overwhelming easy, and other times its just tidal wave after tidal wave of enemies running at you. But like I said, once you learn & get comfortable with the weapons & blocking system you'll breeze through it...well not really breeze, but it'll become easier.  The graphics were pretty spectacular. The hobos looked really unique, twisted, and crazy. The enviroments, though dark, where really well designed and looked really run down (which is a good thing for a survival horror game of this sort). One enemy, the last boss, looked especially weird and scary. Even the fire looked almost lifelike. To put it simply - Condemned really took advantage of the X-Box 360's hardware amd everything is amazing.  The sound effects were basically perfect. The music really helped add tension, and build anxiety while the sound effects sounded brutal and painful. Each weapon provided an either satisfying thud or bang. The enemies growls, heavy breathing and screams were really scary and added more to the atmosphere. There is cursing, which helps to add personality to every character as well. A perfect 10.  What kinda bummered me out about this title was how short it was, and how convuluted & confusing the story became in the later stages, and finally the ending. In the middle of the game, you find out that the man you are chasing is actually a serial killer who kills serial killers with the codename Serial Killer X. At the end of the game, you capture him with the help of some old guy named Malcom VanHorn,,who, it turns out, is Serial Killer X's uncle. Anyway, you have a choice whether to cap SKX or keep him alive, and no matter what you end up in a coffee shop talkin to Rosa (shes a woman who helps you out throughout the entire game) about what happened. She leaves, you go to the bathroom, vomit, and then turn to the camera looking like the last boss fight who was a monster... I was lost, and I'm sure you are too.  Either way, If you want to play a game that will freak you out while providing awesome combat, great enemy AI, and excellent graphics & sound - then Condemned is for you.

181,76628,2,False,"11 17, 2007",A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B000BT1BUS,NeuroSplicer,"I knew this one sported StarForce (thanks to Amazon Reviewers with brass ones - and not intimidated by the gaming industry hyenas); yet, I found it in a electronics megamarket bin for $3 and could not resist. (Goes to show what the value of ridiculously ""protected"" games becomes in less than a year).  StarForce aside (and after subtracting 2 stars for its intrusive risk to our systems), this RTS seems undecided as to what it aimed for. Trying to combine strategy with action is not new, WARCRAFT 3 (for one) did it much better. You have your hero (Alexander or Cleopatra) and then you build up your army to complete the corresponding campaign. You build your base and your workers gather wood and gold. When strong enough you go (or get thrown) into battle - to earn the third resource: glory. All three are needed to advance to the next eras.  The graphics can be adequately good if run on high settings; low settings are pretty disappointing. The units are well designed though, and their movements and spilled blood give a realistic taste.  The controls will take you some time to get used to as, not only do they take up quite a chunk of the screen, but are temperamental in responding as well. Selecting units, especially in the heat of the battle, can be tricky too, as more often than not, workers receive by mistake the order to run into the front line and fight hand-to-hand with the armed enemy: an expensive short-lived sight.  The only thing that keeps this game afloat is, well, its naval warfare. Most RTS avoid them as too messy and complicated (haven't seen a solid effort since C&C: RED ALERT 2), however R&F:CaW demonstrates well designed ships, historically (more or less) accurate naval warfare techniques and quite enjoyable animations.

Now all of our hopes and prayers have been answered and the product is Soul Caliber II. Soul Caliber II is packed with plenty of modes of gameplay. First off there is the Weapon Masters Mode which will keep anyone busy for awhile and added to that are over 250 unlockable items such as characters, costumes, and weapons. Yes I did say weapons and that is perhaps what makes this game so sweet. By having each character have over a dozen weapons the game will take some time to master.

227,129758,3,False,"08 13, 2010",A3AVVH342UQC0B,B0012N746W,Greg Sword,"Since Action / Adventure games tend to be the types of games I most enjoy, I figured it was high time that I finally played a game from the series that pretty much seems to be a cornerstone of the genre : TOMB RAIDER. With that in mind, I picked up 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' on the cheap for only $10 and got to it. Not having really much of an idea what to expect from the game, beyond what little I knew about the iconic main character from movies, comics and hearsay, I can at least say that I had an open mind and a fresh take on the series / game, as I set out to play it. Which, I suppose served me well, because as much as I enjoyed aspects of it and did overall enjoy it more than not, there were definitely some aspects of it that were exceptionally frustrating. So let's get to it....  THE GOOD : The first thing that struck me about the game was how beautiful everything was. From the obvious elements like Lara's perfect rack and tightly wardrobed body (which I guess has always been one of the series draws?) to the expansive, lush and exceptionally atmospheric scenery, everything in this game was quite pleasing to the eye, to say the least. I found myself, a good number of times, just stopping to look around at the environment around me. Especially on the jungle levels which seemed to have a great amount of detail and work put into them. Even on the cold weather levels, the environment was done well enough to the point that it felt stark and cold, but never got boring to look at. All in all, the game was quite a feast for the eyes. But in addition to being good on the eyes, the game was also a bit of a challenge for the brain. The puzzles and solutions to them definitely required some thought. Not so much so that it was ridiculously frustrating, but definitely enough to keep you busy and challenging yourself. Sometimes it would involve looking for a specific artifact, sometimes it was simply a matter of figuring out how to get from one point to the next. Whatever the case, it was rarely, if ever, dull. Something else that kept the game from getting dull, and this gets back to the environments, was the diversity of them. From underwater adventures, to jungle treks, to ruined temples, to the arctic, this game definitely had some diversity to it. Even the weapons category, which, for the most part was pretty basic, mixed it up by throwing tranquilizer guns, spear guns and even a special treat : Thor's mystical (and powerful!) hammer Mjolnir, into the mix along with Lara's standard dual pistols and a few other 'standard' guns. None of these weapons had the 'realistic' feel that so many of us are used from playing FPS type games, but then again, that's not what this category of gaming is really about. It's more about the adventure and the challenge it puts you through. Because it's fun to take Lara through these diverse locales, navigating deadly traps and environments and fending off dangerous and sometimes otherworldly creatures of all shapes and sizes. And in this regard, 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' gets it right.  THE BAD : Unfortunately, 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' gets some things wrong too - big things. Those being the camera and controls, which, in ANY game can be a killer and degrade the fun immensely. Especially since games are all about one thing and one thing only : how much fun did you have playing it? I wouldn't say I didn't have fun playing this game, but I can definitely say that after struggling with a camera that seemed to have a mind of it's own, somewhat unresponsive controls and glitchy software that acted oddlly and at times completely froze up, in the end, I didn't have as much fun as I strted out having and was hoping I'd end up having. To break it down a bit, the camera often didn't position itself in the most advantageous spot and as was so often the case, when you'd go to adjust it to where you wanted it, it wouldn't always stay there. At other times, it was near impossible to get the camera to any decent angle at all, such as if you were stuck in a corner or some other tight spot and needed a clearer view of your positioning. Too often this would result in an unnecessary, intentional death just to 'reset' things. Tacking right on to the bad camera (which I understand from reading some reviews now after having played this, that this has been a LONG running problem with this whole series), are the bad controls. All too often Lara wouldn't do what I was punching into the controller for her to do, or going in a direction I wasn't sending her in, etc. This, too, resulted in a lot of unnecessary deaths. Another killer in this game was the glitchy software. At times I experienced Lara getting stuck in a 'pattern' of action that required pressing a completely unrelated action to get her to snap out of it. For example, if Lara was in a tight space such as a corner, I wasn't able at times to just turn her around and jump her over the obstacle. It would just cause her to repetitively jump facing into the corner or whatever. I'd have to do something like shoot the gun to get her to 'snap out of it'. Also, there were simple, standard actions that Lara would execute such as getting on a bike or picking up a treasure that caused her to act like a robot and not anything even close to human. And this was just the game being the game - it wasn't a glitch. 'Face this way, now turn towards object x, now turn sideways, now execute action y' type stuff. Nothing fluid that led you to believe you might be watching a person. There was never a feeling you weren't watching a computer generated avatar executing actions you told it to. At other times, the software caused the game to just straight-up freeze on me causing me to have to eject the disc and reboot the system. This didn't happen a ton, but enough that it's worth mentioning. And all of this was in addition to the screen tearing and disappearing Lara I'd experience every now and then, depending on where I was trying to put the camera. All in all, 'TOMB RAIDER : Underworld' really doesn't have too many bad aspects to it, but the things it does have against it are pretty substantial, though not enough to completely kill the fun - just hamper it a decent bit.  THE BOTTOM LINE : It would be too easy to make references to this game being like a very beautiful but fussy and finnicky woman, or some other such reference, so I'll stay away from anything of the sort for fear of coming off as misogynistic. But suffice it to say, that though this game can be fun (especially for the price, if you get it used) and absolutely has its' moments, it also has some pretty glaring weaknesses that definitely can take away from the fun....... Then again, how bad can it really be watching Lara Croft's perfect body in skintight outfits for 8-12 hours? Even when she's only wearing a skimpy wetsuit in freezing arctic water?? Sorry - I had to find a way to work that in. I just found that design choice pretty amusing. I mean, that outfit?? In the arctic?? REALLY?!?!?!? But as I said before, I guess that's always been one of the major appeals of this series so, give the fans what they want, I guess. And really, the bottom line here is that despite its' glaring flaws, this game definitely delivers what it promises and it's done in a beautifully rendered way.",A Flawed But Fun Game That Delivers On What It Promises,1281657600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,figure lara hearsay stick cold strted lush understand ever fear say powerful disc tack execute underwater hammer time tight software get category many thing treat expect object treks atmospheric straight-up direction movie seem fun really position despite part turn control stark right bike froze point angle frustrate try suffice believe feast thor's serve type immensely kill bore cornerstone bit stuff cheap generate screen degrade flaw reference would everything navigate bad disappear finally jump water controller pick scenery idea fresh experience main special size run enjoyed set overall mean system eye stay killer go example do tell every pleasing camera feel give mixed away realistic involve much view reset person amount think pattern none hamper type enjoy like woman creature shoot weakness puzzle character might guess open nothing wear ton diverse experience definitely problem gun tomb element arctic long unfortunately obvious one death otherworldly whatever ruined whole mystical snap artifact dangerous worth dull trap let's first advantageous freeze promise unnecessary eject tightly oddlly led time act game etc game lara's felt also intentional decent bottom human mention mjolnir tend case pick repetitively choice appeal raider play since glitch require underworld expansive struggle though impossible basic adjust cause diversity throw always stop unresponsive spot play i'll action work obstacle break genre hour simply near wetsuit glitchy next render jungle least avatar environment shape result ridiculously glare fluid enough i'd locales seem take regard big treasure act want fan rarely suppose find draws little thing rack face wardrobed series temple lot challenge back wrong beautiful able adventure good use design adventure major game finnicky result mind outfit get deadly skimpy sometimes standard level corner close sideways tranquilizer unrelated death keep make hop watch often along come look specific body happen knew well say fps another get freeze amuse look cause read detail find quite dual somewhat croft's way pistol depend space substantial sorry spear environment perfect completely moment action press put delivers high towards cause addition something great weapon simple eye strike feel exceptionally line put that's play comic need misogynistic brain computer outfit beyond clearer go face punch guns price number want position sort especially execute reboot skintight challenge figure even iconic reference matter easy else aspects mix never review fussy around tear weather end fend send get busy solution robot anything keep absolutely beautifully pretty

I haven't played the Hulk game so I wasn't bothered by that in the least.  There are also complaints that the story is kind of stupid, the characters are cardboard, etc., which is all true.  There are some other complaints that the camera and targeting are a bit problematic...but I have yet to play an XBOX game where that wasn't the case, and they could be worse than in Prototype, so I didn't let that get to me.  The game is set up like GTA, in that there's an open city to explore, and side missions and events to trigger, as well as a main plot that keeps you moving throughout the city at your own pace.  This game is just flat out action on a colossal scale.  It is so much fun.  At one point in the game you find yourself fighting a gigantic monster and its brood of smaller mutants in the middle of Times Square, as hundreds of civilians flee for their lives, and the military deploys dozens of tanks, helis, and soldiers at you all at the same time.  Later, the final battle takes place on the deck of an aircraft carrier, where you are literally throwing helicopters at your opponent.  In other words, the scale of the action is just insane.  The mix of superpowers and abilities is huge, and your character feels ridiculously powered up.  But this is really well-balanced in the game, and as powered as you are, you will have to use some real strategy and no doubt make numerous attempts to achieve your objectives.  I must have died about 30 times trying to beat the final ""boss""--but it never got old because each time around I was able to use different strategies, moves, and powers--you're not forced to repeat the same steps, because the game gives you so many ways to combat your foes.  In any situation, you can use a huge variety of powers, or just grab guns or rocket launchers from dead soldiers, or hijack and drive tanks and helicopters. You can fight from the air by running up buildings and drop down on the enemies, or on the ground for intense hand-to-hand, or stay far back and used ranged powers, or just throw trucks and cars and air conditioning units at your enemies!  You can truly create your own gameplay experience based on your own fighting style and tactics.  This is some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game.

274,268979,5,False,"04 7, 2015",A2KP62ZRRNHMGC,B0074LJ3CE,Steven Bonner,"The Mortal Kombat franchise is timeless. Never has a single fighting game remained so popular and branched off to so many different avenues than MK has. Mortal Kombat on the Vita is a re-imagining of the first three MK games. The story all comes together and you learn the origins of all your favorite characters that you've grown to love over the years.  The Story Mode is awesome. You can't skip the cutscenes (Until you beat the game), but this isn't a problem because you will actually enjoy watching them. The scenes look great, and the voice actors do a very nice job. The game plays out in chapters; Each chapter you take on the role of a different character. This is a great place to learn how each character plays. Not all characters are playable in the Story Mode, but that's because they weren't part of the story in the first 3 games. All characters can be played in the other modes of the game.  The fighting system really seems perfected in this game. This is the 9th entry in the Mortal Kombat series, so Ed Boon has had a lot of practice with this genre. Every match flows so smoothly, with the punches and kicks connecting like this was real life. You can fill up a meter by landing attacks and special moves, and when it's full you hold L and R at the same time to perform an X-Ray attack. If this connects, the game slows down and you do major damage to your opponent. You see the inside of their skeleton as the background goes black and you hear the bones crack. You would think these moves would kill them, considering what you do to them, but they keep fighting like nothing happened. (Unless, of course, you took out the rest of their health bar.) There are many special moves for every character to learn and use as well.  There are no characters to unlock, but this game is full of content and has plenty other things to unlock. The Krypt returns from past MK games. You get MK Koins for winning fights, and these Koins are used to unlock Koffins in the Krypt. There are a LOT of them to unlock. You need close to 300,000 Koins in total to unlock everything in the game. Unlockables range from alternate costumes, new Fatalities, music, concept art, and more. (Although if you perform a hidden Fatality in Arcade or Versus Mode, it will automatically be unlocked.) The game will have you busy for months. Even when everything is unlocked, you can play online battles as well. Local AD-HOC multiplayer is also supported.  The load times are not an issue. They are very fast and never slow down the game. Mortal Kombat Unchained on the PSP could have been a great game, but it had such long load times that they destroyed the fun. This is all fixed on the Vita, thanks to the flash memory cart.  All of the old stages from the first 3 games make a return, and they are all redesigned. They look amazing, and you get a huge taste of nostalgia as you play on them. You will be familiar with the stages and characters if you have ever played any of the original games. This game just truly feels like THE definitive Mortal Kombat experience. There are 26 stages in all. The fact that it's all portable is just astounding. I'd like to take you back in time to 1994. Mortal Kombat II was released on the Sega Game Gear and Nintendo Game Boy. It was great for the time. Back then, people were shocked at how we could have portable MK, period. But now, who would have thought that 11 years later we would be playing a portable MK game of this magnitude on the go? With these graphics and all of this content? It's just amazing.  Aside from Story Mode, Arcade Mode is present as well. You fight up the ladder as usual. This can also be played in Tag Team mode. You've also got Training Mode to hone your skills. The other main feature in this game are the two Challenge Towers. In the main Challenge Tower, you go through 300 different challenges, each increasing in difficulty. This is basically mission mode. It's similar to the event matches in Super Smash Bros. The challenges are quite varied, and range from all kinds of different factors. You may have less health than your opponent, you may be weaker than your opponent, you might have to land a certain amount of hits on them, or you might have to fight multiple opponents at once. It's quite varied and yields great rewards. It's also a great way to rack up Koins.  Exclusive to the Vita version is the Bonus Challenge Tower. This has 150 new and exclusive challenges, all utilizing the Vita's touchscreen and gyroscope. (Meaning when you tilt the system. You may tilt the system to make the whole arena move.) You will swipe across the screen to attack enemies. It's very different, but also a nice change of pace. In this mode, you can unlock many costumes exclusive to the Vita version as well!  Test Your Might and Test Your Sight return, as well as new modes Test Your Strike and Test Your Luck. Test Your Slice is also included, exclusive to the Vita. This is basically an M-rated version of Fruit Ninja. You slice body parts in half with your finger as they fly across the screen while you avoid the bombs. Very awesome, very satisfying. Test Your Balance is another Vita exclusive mode. You tilt your Vita to keep your character from falling. Simple, yet strangely satisfying.  There are 32 characters in all. An absolutely huge roster, as each character is completely unique. Freddy Kruger from A Nightmare on Elm Street and Kratos from God of War are guest characters. That is truly awesome. The Fatalities are as gruesome as ever. Each character has 2 Fatalities, as well a Stage Fatality and a Babality. (Not every stage has a Stage Fatality) Watch some of these on YouTube to get an idea of just how violent they are. One of my favorites is Shang Tsung's. He transforms into an evil clown and blows the head off of his opponent with a gun. This is a nod to the Joker's Fatality in Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe. Ed Boon and his team made that game too, so it's awesome to see this Fatality return. It's so awesome.  Ed Boon and his team at NetherRealm Studios really outdid themselves for this game. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making the Vita version as good as it can be. (This game is also on the PC, PS3, and 360.) Sadly it seems this was the swan song of MK portables, because Mortal Kombat X is being developed for the iPad.. not the Vita. Regardless, that can be blamed on the sales of the hardware, as the Vita isn't really alive anymore. Mobile phones and tablets is where the money is at, so the Vita is left behind. Knowing that, I'm just glad this game was released. It's a classic that will always be fun to play. We may never see a portable MK game like this again.

280,443153,5,True,"08 2, 2016",A1PSBR3JRZ9VO0,B01GW3GM7I,Vdub,"Today is a day I have waited a long time for, the day my Xbox One is no longer the size of a VCR from 1989.  Compared with the original Xbox One, we have a few key differences. Most good, but not all.  Pros vs. Original Xbox One: [+] 40% smaller! And yes, the difference is very noticeable (see my comparison pictures) [+] 4K output. Not as big of a deal to most people as 4K adoption is not huge yet, and it's only really for video/Blu-ray (games are upscaled) [+] The side USB port has been moved from the left side to the front, which is great for space saving (if another device is to the left) and less damaging if someone trips over the USB cable. [+] No gloss finish. They did get rid of the gloss in a minor pre-S refresh, but I'm happy to see it is completely gone. As always, glossy finishes look great on day one but do NOT age well (easily scuffed and scratched). [+] Built-in power supply. To me, this is HUGE (reverse pun intended). The old power supply added an unreasonable amount of heft to the already oversized console. It is especially great if you like to pack and travel with your Xbox since that's one less brick to carry around, and makes it much easier and cheaper to have spare 'travel' power cables so you don't have to remove your main cables when traveling. [+] Hardware upgrade. In addition to the 4K hardware upgrade (HDMI 1.4 vs HDMI 2.0), there is more processing power available for HDR, though to be honest I'm not sure how much I care about that. The real hardware upgrade won't be until Project Scorpio in 2017. [*] Higher capacity. You can now choose from models ranging from 500GB to 2TB! I definitely recommend no less than 1TB considering how quickly these games eat up hard drive space. I'm not a fan of cluttering up my area with external USB hard drives, so the extra internal space of the 2TB version was a huge selling point to upgrade.  Cons vs. Original Xbox One: [-] As of launch, only available in white. Don't get me wrong, the white looks beautiful, but you can't go wrong with additional color choices. In my case, white matching NOTHING else in my home theater setup, so I would have preferred to stick with black. I'm sure that will come soon though. [-] No elite version (yet), which means no hybrid SSD available for faster load times. Elite controller still works great though. [-] Does not offer any option of a bundled Kinect, though it has been clear for awhile that Kinect support has been dwindling. [-] Does not include a headset, not even a cheapy earbud-style one. [-] Kinect users *raises own hand* effectively lost a USB port. They removed the Kinect-specific port, so now you'll have to use up one of the two rear USB ports to get your Kinect on. This also raises the issue of the console not including a Kinect-to-USB adapter, which just adds extra hassle to get your Kinect Kinected again.  PSA regarding Kinectability mentioned above: For a limited time, you can get a free Kinect-to-USB adapter by contacting Xbox Support and providing your serial numbers.  *Is it worth upgrading my Xbox One?*  There is not a one-size-fits all answer to this. For me, it was a yes, as I was replacing a secondary Xbox One and I wanted the 2TB and smaller footprint. My Elite is still my main console, which I'm not ready to replace with the S due to the hybrid SSD and color. For most people, I would bet the answer is no. If money is a concern, it's probably no. If you don't 4K game or need the extra terabyte, it's probably no. If you're just a tech geek like me and always need the latest stuffs and thingies, then go for it!  For bonus entertainment, check out my attached comparison pictures of 15 years worth of Xbox hardware generations. The Xbox One S is now as small as the original Xbox 360, but not quite to the size of the Xbox 360 S/E. Unsurprisingly, the original Xbox One was even bigger than the original 2001 Xbox.  Ultimately, I'm still much more eagerly awaiting the full Scorpio hardware update, but the Xbox One S was a long overdue refresh. If nothing else, it at least leaves the Xbox One no longer as a beastly, oversized, whalephant, VCR, gargantuan, monolithic mass of plastic as its prior version was.","Objective Pros and Cons vs. The

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"(NOTE: SINCE JULY 2012, THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN ENTIRELY REWRITTEN) Well, since New Super Mario Bros 2 is coming out for the 3DS later, I kinda figured I may as well go back and look at the title that started a series that harks back to the even-older days. I remember when I used to be really excited for this one. After seeing a picture of a supersized Mario running through a field of Koopas, I had to get it. However, it kept being delayed....And then when it finally came out, I got it, and I wasn't disappointed.  Those that have played the original Super Mario Bros series (as well as Super Mario World) know what to expect. Classic 2D Goomba-stomping block-breaking action throughout all-new levels. This is something we haven't seen since Super Mario World (Although there have been remakes and stuff), so it is pretty cool getting fresh 2D Super Mario action once again. What's also great is that the gameplay still remains to be good fun, and with all these new levels, as well as some other elements mixed in, it just makes it even better.  One downside is that while the minigames were a nice touch, but they were mostly recycled from Super Mario 64 DS. I guess it's okay for those that don't own Mario 64 DS, but those expecting new minigames will be disappointed.  However, 4-Player multiplayer makes the minigames fresh again! Meanwhile, you can also play with a friend in a Versus mode in while Mario and Luigi compete and find Stars around 5 levels. That is pretty fun, actually, especially when getting to use the power-ups to sabotage the other player.  Overall, this is a pretty great adventure that does the original SMB series justice.

Everything from the hand drawn backrounds to the exceptional backround music just screams quality and dedication. I'm even more impressed that the game sounds as good as it does despite the Megadrive's lackluster sound chip.  The only problem I guess I have is how short the game is, around 10 stages and most stages take only 5-7ish minutes to complete tops. I do however, like that the game isn't exceptionally brutal on the difficulty like other Disney/Virgin Interactive games(namely Lion King, screw that stampede stage).  Kinda sad that Virgin Interactive went defunct in 2003, whenever they worked with Disney they always managed at the very least a good game. Sadly, the last few games they released were absolute tosh and despite helping Capcom with Dino Crisis and Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, they just couldn't stay afloat.  Anyway, I highly reccomend you to at least try the Jungle Book out, hell you can get it for all of 4$ on Amazon.

It's super easy to aim at the spawn locations and just keep killing them as they spawn. Overall, this is my least favorite title out of the 6 or 7 games I have bought for Wii U.

300,46302,4,False,"12 12, 2003",AC5SRB7KCAIEE,B00009M7Q8,Matthew Warner,"If you've heard of the original Deus Ex before, then you've probably heard some things about it's sequel. Depending on where you look, Deus Ex: Invisible War (i.e. Deus Ex 2) is either a refreshing breeze in console gaming, a horrifying example of what happens when you ""dumb down"" a game to appeal to a broader audience, or the worst thing ever subjected to the video gaming public. Hmm. I bought the game (mixed reviews or no) and went through it in three days, determied to come to my own conclusions. And now, I can safely say, that nearly every review I read was spot on. Depending on how you look at it, this can be a fantastic game, a death knell for intelligent game design, or a steaming pile that you accidentally stepped in and now it's stinking up the house. That said, I'm not going to get into the plot of either the original or of Invisible War here, since this is one of those rare games where it's best to go in blind, but everything else is fair game. So... Having been a massive fan of the PC original, I'd been awaiting the release of Invisible War since Warren Spector himself, adressing some fan's issues with the multiplayer patch, mentioned that they only had one guy on the team still working on the original Deus Ex; everyone else was hard at work on the game's next installment. Which brings me nicely to point number one: If you've yet to play the original Deus Ex, go there first. It can be had for next to nothing, will run on practically any modern PC, and it easily the best way to determine whether this type of game is for you or not without having to spend a lot of money. On top of that, and despite what a lot of reviews have said, DX:IW is indeed a true sequel to the original. It picks up twenty years later, but there's no doubt that you're in the same world, and having the events of the first game under your belt will aid immensely in getting through the second installment while still having some idea of what the hell is going on (not a given with these games - you have to pay attention). So, assuming that you're familiar with the first game and liked it as much as everyone seems to, here's the real question: Does the sequel stack up? Not really. But it's still pretty fun. The biggest gripe that can be said about IW, and the one that nearly everyone comes to independantly, is that the game feels cut. And I'm not talking about things that were omitted from Invisible War that were in the original (did anyone ever use the Iron Lung mod, anyway?) I mean it feels like things were going to be implemented in Invisible War that were ultimately dropped. It's like watching a movie where you just know that there was something that got cut at the last minute, and they didn't have time to re-edit it properly. The best example I can think of is right at the beginning of both games. In the original DX, you start right in the heart of things, engaging in a sting operation to free the Statue of Liberty from terrorist occupation. You go in, you do your thing, the game quietly keeps track of HOW you do your thing, and then...You go to work. It's established that you're essentially a futuristic cop, and much of the early part of the game is spent establishing the plot and showing off your technology to let the player acclimate to it. So, when things start to go haywire (which, and I mean this in a good way, they do quite suddenly) it's honestly engaging, especially as the layers begin to reveal themselves. Do you stick with your old affiliations? Oh, wait, they were operating behind your back! But...So were the other people you were going to work for! Aaah! Who do you trust? By comparison, DX:IW gets you dressed, prepped, and out the door in the first ten minutes of gametime. You're out of Chicago in the opening movie, in Seattle in the first scene, and then BAM, you're free of all obligations right from the get-go. No police affiliation, no real information, but thankfully, everyone seems to know your number and wants to call you. It sounded good on paper, I'm sure, but in practice it's jarring and serves more to distance the player from the game than anything else. You never really get the chance to feel betrayed or double-crossed by anyone, because, well, you never really care about them to begin with. It's a tough sell to explain this to someone who is unfamiliar with either game, so here's something worth noting: The only way you'd notice is if you played both games. The other big gripe about DX:IW is that it runs horribly, regardless of which platform you choose. If you'd rather go with the PC version, expect to burn some serious power on this game. The Xbox version, which is pretty choppy and prone to slowdown, at least looks good when it's not moving, and is definitely the better choice for anyone without a monster PC. This was a common complait with the first game as well, though it's a moot one now. Here's the kicker: Even the most stringent critic of DX:IW noted that, while they thought the game was loaded with problems, they kept playing it. A lot. Sometimes, when they beat it, they'd fire it right back up and start all over again. What gives? Well, it sounds odd, but for all this game's problems and occasionally wonky design scheme (all weapons use the same type of ammo? C'mon...) it's still fun. In fact, a lot of the time it's so fun that you forget about all the other stuff that bothered you about it, and at the very least it makes these problems forgivable. I beat the game in three days. If I wasn't having fun, there's no way I could have done that, I don't care how much I loved the first game. With DX:IW, the problems will bother you if you let them, and particularly if you were a big fan of the first one, but at the end of the day, it's still a fantastically fun game. Manipulating all the factions to your whim, or having them do it to you, is such a cool game mechanic that it overshadows everything else and really saves this game. Again, critics will point out that this was done better in the first game (and it was.) Taken on it's own merits, though, DX:IW is a competent sequel that still gave me that same sense of cool that the first one had in droves.

I've played the gothic series, elder scrolls, dragons dogma, reckoning etc....and liked them all in some kind of way.  gothic had a dark and cruel world that made you start with a stick and a hut.  you really had to prove your worth to certain factions and it gave you a real sense of accomplishment if you could pull it off. Skyrim has a lush and beautiful world with amazing visuals and tight controls for combat that had you saying ""more more"". Dragons dogma had ground breaking deep combat never seen it an open world rpg that we've never seen before. What does two worlds two have? Not....much.   It does have: bad controls, bad camera angles, crumby graphics, awful voice acting, weak story line, unbalanced questing, cumbersome inventory with a poor excuse for an interface and worst of all a combat system that will have you saying ""what in the....""  Over and over.   The controls are the biggest problem with me because bad controls make for bad combat( at least on the console versions). The controls are just cumbersome and unresponsive. I can never do what I want to do. They had the right idea with mapping your abilities with x y b a but that's not the problem. The problem is, they thought it smart to make the sneak button the same as the run button.  jump is also the action button such as mounting a horse or opening a chest or character interaction etc... That makes for sloppy and awkward gameplay. ie I meant to sneak up on this guy but I ran right at him or I'm trying to talk to this dude but I keep jumping around him instead. WHY!?? This will cause you to shout obscenities you never thought possible and have your wife laughing at you(ok that was just me but you get the picture). And don't get me started on mounting a horse OH MY GOD! I mountin a horse in this game is like trying to give a girl a Cheerio as an engagement ring....it just doesn't work. In fact I can't think of one time I mounted my horse without incidents of jumping around it first.  Riding the horse is just as messed up. The trigger buttons make the horse go and stop. Any one who played skyrim red dead redemption or assassins will want to kill every horse they ride. It's so awkward.  The developers also thought it would be a really radical idea to put obstacles like fences and barrels in the middle of the roads you have to jump over. Surrreee, that sounds cool but the game is so random with the timing of the jumps that your lucky if you make it. I think it has something to do how bad the collision detection is in this game.   This problem migrates into combat, which at first I liked until the horrible hit detection and unresponsive controls lurked its way into the combat. Switching weapons is as easy trying to round house chuck Norris. Just mash up on the d-pad a few times eventually it'll happen. Need to drink a potion mid-combat? No problem, just mash your right bumper a few hundred times till your dingus character feels like drinking it.   And the worse part of combat is starting it. The game feels the need for you to draw your weapon.  I know sounds easy enough (skyrim did it, gothic did) however............ You have to press down on the d-pad again sounds easy right?  Well remember how I said its like trying to round house chuck Norris??  It's worse. You have to be standing perfectly still to draw your weapon problem is, if you get ambushed you natural instinct is to run and reposition yourself so drawing your weapon In combat is like try to round house the entire cast of the expendables........2.  It's just bad. I'm constantly fighting the controls in this game. Every step along the journey. Which had forced me to suspend gameplay.   That's right.  No, I haven't beaten it yet. I will get back into it though,I always beat the games I get.   As far as your character and story goes. It's sucks. I really can't think of anything else to say except that your character is extremely unlikable and a cheeseball voice acter,he just sucks.   There aren't many pros to this game but it does have a really cool magic system. The spells are 100% costumized and you can create some really cool spells. This system is something I hope more games in the genre start to copy cat. Look some up on YouTube it's really cool.

Single Player Campaign -------------------------------------------- There are 3 different campaigns one for each of the different factions: Soviets, Allies, and The Rising Sun (Japanese).  There are 9 missions per campaign, which is a total of 27. You have a co-commander for most of these missions and the resources you gather will be divided evenly between you and your computer AI co-commander.  Skirmish (Against Computers) -------------------------------------------- There are 3 factions, Allies, Soviets, and Rising Sun. Each computer AI faction has 3 commanders, each with their own style/strategy.  Changes from Red Alert 1 & Red Alert 2: -------------------------------------------- - No more ore fields, now they are setup as mines (like Warcraft 3). One collector per mine will suffice. - Can attack everything, not just units but buildings too without clicking on them (set your units to aggressive stance or use the hotkey Alt+A) - Most/all units have alternate attacks and special abilities - Detailed statistics are kept for your profile, so every time your play in offline in Skirmish or Online, those stats will be kept. - Improved AI, when playing in Skirmish (against computers), they are more of a challenge - When playing in Skirmish (with allied computers) you can give them command orders - Each faction has 3 commanders with their own distinct tactics and strategy. They also talk smack at the beginning and end of the match where your minimap turns into a video transmission from the enemy commander - Engineer rushing is less effective, since it now takes time for the engineer to take control of a building. - Added special faction abilities. For instance, you can do a airplane sweep and reveal part of the map or freeze enemy units/buildings depending on what you upgrade. These are setup in tiers, and will be available to upgrade when enough time has passed. Each ability has a cooldown time. - Building multiple Barracks/Buildings won't speed up building times, but rather you can build additional units from those buildings - Minimap is not completely black, but rather the map is shown but with fog of war (again, similar to Warcraft 3). Also, you don't need a radar station (or Airfield etc.) to see the minimap, it is on automatically.  Technical Issues: -------------------------------------------- The shadows are pixelated. Not a big deal, but good to know that it's not a computer problem.  Online activation with 5 Authorizations. If you used all 5 of your authorizations, you can deauthorize one of them and will be able to play it on another computer.

In the Christmas of 1996, the Nintendo 64 arrived.  The Nintendo 64, or N64 as it is sometimes referred, followed in the wake of success of the first Sony console, the PlayStation, and started producing their games with 3D graphics. Instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward, or left and right, you could now move in all directions. This opened a portal for Nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds. For example, Mario was no longer a 16-bit side scrolling red and blue pixel, but a small Italian man with a healthy knack for adventure. Being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before. The result ended up being games like Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offer.  With a very simple design and set up like the previous 2 Nintendo consoles (SNES & NES) the 64 was another cartridge based Nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance (remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles?). The controller however, was something that was dramatically different from both previous Nintendo consoles. This controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard 2 or 4 buttons. The analog stick was great for the 3D games and made it very easy to navigate, however, after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or another.  It's interesting to see how Nintendo has come full circle, evolving to something like the Nintendo 64 and in some ways digressing back to it's origins with games like New Super Mario Bros U, which is much like Super Mario Bros for SNES but with updated graphics and a few more tweaks.",Nintendo Explores New Territory in 64-bit,1393804800,,,,player evolve move blow much nintendo update star character longer world way legend like red refer console ocarina however hour load graphic way bros generally origin could start come pixel open sony fox time circle cartridge enough analog button countless take ne something great simple console different navigate stop leave interesting italian put friend see backward one play offer new back success make tweak right covet dramatically follow able adventure limiting maintenance end truly zelda first design super portal game full remember digress result time gaming get would blue sometimes standard close snes vivid mario finally see controller easy arrived year man forward playstation immersive side never christmas scroll around stick set cartridge work classic gameplay instead previous wake direction example base another offer knack produce healthy small

You participate in a tournament called Horizon Festival and your goal is to win the tournament and beat the champion Darius Flynt. The game has a decent roster of cards but it is less than Forza 4. You start off with a old Volkswagen Corrado and work your way up to more exotic cars such as BMW's, Ferrari's, and Bugatti's. When you join the festival they give you a wristband. When you complete an event you get points. After earning a certain amount of points you get your next wristband allowing you to participate in more challenging events. Races can be easy or hard depending on how you set the difficulty. You can choose your opponent's level, manual or automatic, a driving line, ABS, and more. The more assists you turn off, the more money you get after completing an event but its also harder. There are also Showcase Events which require you to race something such as a bi-plane, a helicopter, or even hot air baloons. The game has a lot of replay-ability. There is a popularity chart which you climb higher on by performing skills such as drifting and drafting. I beat the Horizon Champion but I'm still not number one!

If you want to collect all the cars then you are going to have to do a lot of events to afford some cars.  The game does however, charge you for some cars as DLC.

Fortunately, Grandia 3 brings it back, and with better graphics it is all the more impressive.  I only wish the rest of the game was equally impressive.    In my mind a good rpg needs 3 things.  A good battle system, a decent to outstanding plot, and at least a few sidequests.  Grandia 3 may have one of the worst plots in any rpg I have played.

330,215591,1,False,"01 3, 2013",A2DRPL4GAZ0PAI,B003R3JNN2,Rick,"This is one of the most aggravating game experiences I can remember.  The controls are horrid.  They tried to make the game more action oriented, like Harry Potter meets Gears of War, but what they ended up with is just a big mess.  The cover system sucks, half the time you can't get harry to take cover when you want him to, and you can't use your Patronus spell while under cover so you have to detach from your cover spot to ward off attacking Dementors, making yourself vulnerable to other enemies.  The spell selection controls are actually the only positive thing I can say about this game, you press the right bumper button which pauses the action and brings up the spell selection wheel which is helpful since there are a wide variety of spells to choose from, but you'll only wind up using 2 or 3 of them, basically the equivalent of a machine gun, shotgun or rocket launcher.  The game is extremely linear, at certain points in the game you are given the option of choosing between 3 different missions, but since you have to complete all 3 to move on with the story they really don't amount to much, and feel more like they were just thrown in to pad out the game time.  Filler.  In any other game these missions be side challenges and not part of the main game.  Anyway, they put out another movie so I guess someone had to churn out something in the way of a video game.  I haven't got Kinect (and I'm not going to) so I can't comment on that part of the game.

This Special Edition starts with the regular Starfighter title (available on other platforms) and adds in extra levels and tons of multiplayer features! To start with, there are three different characters you play, each in his or her own style of ship. Rhys is a Nabooian cadet with a little quick fighter, with limited torpedoes. Vana is a mercenary - her ship can tag enemies and then blast them. Nym is the alien, and he's got bombs on his, great for blasting capital ships. You take these three different ships on a series of missions, both on planet and in space. You dodge through asteroid belts, zip along narrow canyons, defend bases and blow apart the bases of your enemies. There's tons of fun dogfighting, trying to blow up ships both large and small. The missions make sense, and your wingmen obey commands with reasonable AI. The graphics are beautiful! There are rivers snaking through green valleys. Desolate planets with mining operations. Giant asteroid fields that you have to dodge through. The ships each look and act differently, but are generally similar enough that it's not a huge chore to switch amongst them as you go through missions.

337,156898,4,False,"02 28, 2010",A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O,B00149KCIG,The Trophy,"Welcome to gaming in the year 2010!!! What does the video game market mostly consist of? Well, some pretty lame ""World of Warcraft"" type games that turn your friends and loved ones into the trolls they seek to kill in game, (Because they become anti-social and afraid of hygiene) the same shooter game, with really pretty graphics but missing quality and attention to gameplay, re-released about 30 times a year to make different shooter games that all sell really well because TONS of people blindly buy into hype and marketing campaigns, some hack and slash games, and some really ""hardcore"" games on social networking sites where you can build chicken cages, run a farm,(NOTE: Harvest Moon stole that idea from them and went back in time about 15 years to make the first Harvest Moon game on SNES) operate a fish tank...you know some real white knuckled sitting on the edge of your seat type gameplay? Soon we can expect to see a game on some of those sites where you can mow lawns for money, hold doors for people, or put your shoes on. AWW, DUDE TOO COOL!!! Yep, a lot's changed in the past couple of years from the days when your choices were PS2, Xbox, Gamecube, PC, or older systems with unique and original games being released quite frequently. Sure there are still good games that come out nowadays, but they are pretty scarce with all the lackluster games that flood the market. So where does all this leave a game like ""Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust?"" Pretty much in a category of it's own, and that's not a bad thing at all.    First, most people will most likely notice right away the graphics aren't up to par with other games being released around this time. The question is: Why do some people really care about a game's graphics to the extent they do? Me? I'd be happy with a game that was super fun to play, and had mediocre graphics. But that's just me. These days developers focus way too much on graphics. Sure there may be some jaggy edges to some of the levels or whatever else, but you can see it can't you? Here's the deal. Anything man made is never going to be perfect. Video games are no exception. The game is $20 now...so for $20 people can get passed the graphics not looking flawless.    Second, the dialogue in this game is a step up from the last game. Great voice cast, too! I LOVED THE LAST LEISURE SUIT LARRY GAME, but the last ""Leisure Suit Larry game"" had potty humor that was a bit grosser and comparable in levels of cheesiness to the later seasons of ""Married With Children."" In this game, the writer, who also wrote Grandma's Boy (A pretty sweet movie)did a good job, and managed to make the dialogue intelligent potty humor. I didn't like the dialogue originally when I played through the first level with someone else, but when I got my own copy of this game and played through things again I found the dialogue enjoyable, funny, and I actually understood everything that was going on the second time through!    Third, the controls in this game are actually pretty good, despite what a lot of people have said. I think a lot of people got upset when they died a couple of times and gave up after that. Yeah, when I first picked up the game, it was a bit of a challenge. But when I went back and re-played some levels, I was able to control Larry very well. For instance, the first time I played the first studio level, I couldn't jump from platform to platform very well without dying. The Second time? Piece of Cake. Never died once. As the game went on, I was having NO problem controlling Larry. Also, the vehicle controls in this game were hard at first, and I heard many people rip on the vehicle controls. AGAIN...Once I learned to control the vehicles, I had no problem cruising around. Also, one reviewer on here said there's no way to get the vehicle unstuck. Wrong. Press down the left thumbstick on your controller (It's called the L3 button) and keep pressing it until your car bounces around enough to wiggle free of being trapped.    Bad controls to me are controls that are unresponsive sometimes or just don't work. This game just takes practice to get through. That's it. Maybe no one has patience anymore since the next gen systems came out?    Fourth, the gameplay was pretty fun and managed to stay varied so that the platforming aspects of this game remained enjoyable. There is the main film lot and three film scenarios you enter and play through...With the second one being the best in my opinion! All of them are different from the last, and that provides for fun gameplay. Now some of the missions can be challenging at points, but keep practicing and experiment with different ways of doing things, and you should be able to pass. For example, the second studio had a mission that involved fire. About 1/2 way through that mission, I could never make it to my destination without the fire lasting and then the mission would end shortly after that. Eventually, I figured out that while my fire was lit I had to keep running back to the fire in order to make it to my destination. I apologize for being vague, I am trying not to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't gotten to that part of the game yet, or who may pick this game up to play in the future. Also, the stealth missions were fun to play. I've played tons of stealth games where you get caught once and it's all the way back to the beginning. (For the record the ""The Family Guy Game"" had the worst stealth missions ever!) But in this game, if you get caught by a guard, you beat them to death, and continue on! There fore, stealth missions can still be fun and not tedious things that make you want to chuck your controller through the center of the TV. Total Win!!! Also, besides the main story missions, you can search for Larry statues located through out the lot, (100 of them total) play race missions, and play missions where you talk to girls. So there's enough quality content here for $20.    Okay, now we've reached the part of the review where we talk about the bad aspects of this game. First, the ending of this game is funny, but it's nothing epic. It doesn't really leave you with a great feeling of achievement. Remember the end of the last game. It was epic and it left you feeling awesome! This ending...you expect another mission to pop up when your done. Second, I loved how in the previous game you could walk up to ALMOST everyone and anything and investigate and interact with them. That's missing in this game. Sure, some people yell if you run into them while on foot but that's it, and it leaves you wanting more. Third, this game has the type of mission where you talk to females, like from the last game, but they aren't all that special. Basically, all the girls look the same except different colored clothing and skin, you go talk to them and say the right thing so that you can go find them an item, then talk to them again and say the right thing, and then every mission ends the same, except for different dialogue. It's nothing great, but the only plus is you can't die and don't have to restart the talking part of these missions over again. Fifth, sometimes...not all the time...but sometimes...the camera does act very stupid. Like in a mission where I had to reach a satelite. Jumping between two pillars and making it to the top depended on if the camera would be in the right position. If not, I usually kept falling. That was annoying. Sixth, Sometimes a dot would appear on my in screen mini-map, but when I'd pause to check for the dot on my larger map and...THE DOTS NEVER SHOWED UP! That's just horrible. The dots did this in the first studio level, I didn't check it out in later parts of the game, so maybe they show up there. Lastly, there's nothing for beating this game or finishing certain aspects of this game...just trophies. OH BOY! The last game gave you new modes of gameplay and you were able to purchase new things and the other endings you didn't get. This time I just get a trophy for bragging rights so all my friends can go online and see I beat a certain a game or a certain aspect of a game. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MIGHT BRAG TO THOSE SAME FRIENDS IN REAL LIFE ABOUT BEATING SOMETHING, AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHECK ME OUT AND MAKE SURE I'M LEGIT...or something lame like that. God, remember when gaming used to be a hobby and now it's a sport? LAME. But I think some trophies are so some developers can be lazy. They say, ""And if they beat all these missions or get so many points, instead of unlocking new in game features...we'll save ourselves time and resources by just giving them a trophy!""    Overall, I think ""Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust"" would have had a better chance at being successful if it were released about 5 years ago. But nowadays, most gamers are too hardcore and too critical of games. Seriously, this was voted worst game of the year by some sites?!?!? WHY?!?! IT'S NOT THAT BAD, IF YOU ARE OPEN TO NEW THINGS AND GIVE IT A CHANCE!!! People... don't fully trust reviews you read from magazines or well known video game critics online where a game is rated 1-10, on a scale of 1-10, to tell you if a game is good or bad. I am convinced a lot of reviewers are paid off or usually can't get passed there own biased thoughts when reviewing games. You are better of checking things out yourself. And if you hate this game, because you loved the old Al Lowe made Leisure Suit Larry games, get over it and give something new a chance. I heard the sequel to the last game (Magna Cum Laude) was canceled, and I was skeptical of this game, but I gave it a shot and walked away loving it.    But sadly, because of poor sales, this is probably going to be the last ""Leisure Suit Larry"" game. But am I the only one that noticed Larry, who pretty much died after this game was released, wore a Micheal Jackson jacket in this game, and shortly after Micheal died in real life? I am going to miss them both very much. Thanks Larry, for the great memories I had of playing ""Magna Cuim Laude"" with friends after school and on the weekends and the memories of playing this game.

The problem is that the game doesn't like me in return, and it's not the typical problems that make Infinite Undiscovery such a pain.  Combat is reasonably simple and fun.  You can attack with two buttons, and hold them down for special attacks.  The enemies are pretty varied, as are the terrains you cover; you fight through forests, grasslands, deserts, castle interiors, and on. You are given a good assortment of companion characters as well, so you never really get bored of your party. (You can swap them out while staying in towns.)  Cut scenes are well done, although the lip-synch is little more than an afterthought, and in game movies are done without voice whatsoever.  In spite of it all, the story is pretty interesting, and the playful dialogue between characters is funny at times.  Even though I've really enjoyed the game, there ARE some definite problems.  The 'Connection' feature, where you take control of one of your three party members, is poorly implemented and not worth the time- except when you're forced into using it by the game.  It's tedious, but it doesn't happen frequently enough to make you throw your controller.  There are other things that annoy, only it's difficult to pinpoint, other than saying 'this game hates me.' But I'll try:  Example: You're given a quest to find a pet bear.  Yes, a pet bear. You talk to the townspeople and they tell you to talk to the local cats. Yes, cats. You 'connect' with the character that talks to animals, but none of the cats seem to have any information. You talk to the townpeople again- now, you're told that the bear left the town, so you go outside to find him. Only there's no bear. You go back into the town and ask everyone again - no new information.  Finally, you talk to the person that gave you the quest, and it triggers a cut scene where you TELL her the bear MIGHT be outside.  Only NOW can you actually find the bear.  This is one of numerous scenes that occur in this way.  Sometimes, the game is completely counter-intuitive, for any number of reasons. It's not unforgivable, but it's still annoying. And yet, I continue playing it . . .",A game that doesn't like gamers.,1248652800,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},,local member implement undiscovery terrain combat poorly desert i'll interior person counter-intuitive connect i've find none character way feature like castle connection say trigger assortment character actually might try completely unforgivable time hold everyone problem get enough button take reason problem simple movie pain townpeople although interesting left scene fun little thing really one attack infinite frequently new tell back annoy spite funny attack cut enemy yes good town dialogue worth varied outside number time pinpoint information forest stay sometimes town game talk annoy still bear voice even finally townspeople playful reasonably controller lip-synch quest except difficult tedious numerous make scene talk cat companion never definite pet special playing continue enjoy occur two story yet without cover typical swap whatsoever though seem fight bore party forced return there's grassland happen ask go hate well use example do three throw animal tell give afterthought pretty control give

344,18590,5,False,"05 8, 2014",A33APICV52GOHS,B00004XRBB,Tim Cashman,"I was getting tired of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3, (CFS3) I had already done just about everything you could do on it, and I was ready for a better flight sim. I have spent many hours on CFS3 and Microsoft Flight Simulator X. I wanted a WWII combat flight sim, so I spent a lot of time looking them up on the internet and on Amazon. Essentially, I found very little about any of the sims, except for these reviews, and finally decided that the only way to find out which one was the best was to buy all of them. I had a $25 Amazon gift card, plus some extra cash, so I began to buy all the combat flight sims I could find for a reasonable price. I have heard that Combat Flight Simulator 2 Pacific Series is great, but I could not find one within my price range. I now own: Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1 (Europe Series) 1998, Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 (Battle For Europe) 2007, Janes WWII Fighters 1998, Janes Attack Squadron 2002, and IL-2 Sturmovik (1946) 2006 (which also includes IL-2 Forgotten Battles, Ace expansion pack, and Pacific Fighters) I own many more flight sims than this, but I have found that anything from 1997 or earlier is not even worth talking about because the graphics are so primitive. I have played all these and compared them for a long time, and I have compiled all their attributes into a Pros and Cons list below. If you take the time to read this, you will know what flight sim is right for you.  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1 (CFS1) (Europe Series) 1998  This sim is based on the earlier portion of the war on the western front, which includes the Battle of Britain, and early operations in France. Flyable aircraft are very limited, but include the Hawker Hurricane, not usually modeled in old flight sims. Many great Battle of Britain planes are present, like the He-111, Do-17, Me-110, Ju-87, Ju-88, and American bombers like the B-25, B-24, and B-17, but these are all non-flyable. There are some unusual missions, like escaping France in a stolen Bf-109, shooting down a traitor in your squadron, and shooting a German generals car out from under the Eiffel Tower! The campaigns are some of the best Ive seen, The Battle of Britain is very engaging, protecting ship convoys from Stukas and U-boats. Rockets and explosions are realistic. CFS1 has pretty bad aircraft graphics, but the ground detail is amazing, taken from an actual satellite. However, this pales since the ground is completely flat except for spiky mountains, and a few badly modeled buildings in the cities. The satellite image also slows down my laptop. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is marginal, fighters attack but know hardly any maneuvers, and enemy bombers don't avoid you. The menu is reasonable, and pretty easy to use.  Pros: Fair Graphics, Fair selection of flyable aircraft, good AI, Fair menu.  Cons: Flat ground, bad aircraft graphics, not enough flyable aircraft, cant fly the P-38 NO MISSION BUILDER (Deal breaker)  What sets it apart: Cool campaigns and missions.  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 (CFS3) (Battle For Europe) 2007  This flight sim is based on the whole war on the western front, from the Battle of Britain to the Battle of the Ardennes, and on. Very unique array of aircraft, ALL are flyable! Planes like the B-25, B-26, Ju-88, and Mosquito are fully modeled, from the controllable gunner positions to the damage modeling. Unusual planes like the P-55 Ascender, and Go-229 flying wing are also flyable, though they would never fly in real life. There are many tanks, flak guns, and ship convoys. There is even an invasion fleet on campaigns on a certain day. Missions are reasonable and challenging, the campaigns are great, with maps, separate available missions, and customization of your own personal aircraft. Campaigns are very lengthy and difficult, however. CFS3 wins the prize for labeling: Aircraft, tanks, airbases, factories, refineries, and other objects are all labeled with their distance from you in feet. This, however, makes it somewhat more of an arcade game unless you turn it off. No mission builder, unless you load one for it off the internet, (Have a nice time figuring that out, they deleted the CFS3 website!) Graphics are good, some trees, many different buildings and airbases, relatively detailed ships, and smooth aircraft. Most of Britain, France and Germany are modeled, and even part of Spain and Switzerland. AI is not that great, enemy fighters sometimes ignore you, but have pretty good aim. They also crash by themselves too easily. Tanks have to stay in their formations, and almost never fire at all. The intro video is intense and extremely realistic, with the exception of the Go-229 at the end. The menu shows your customized aircraft and armament parked next to a hanger, which is cool. User interface is good. Menu music is depressing, which is probably intentional. Relatively realistic in all.  Pros: Good graphics, Great selection of Aircraft, Great factories and ship convoys, Good menu.  Cons: Arcade-like, fake-ish prototype aircraft, ditzy aircraft and vehicle AI, NO MISSION BUILDER.  What sets it apart: Flyable medium bombers with gunner positions, and unusual aircraft.  Janes WWII Fighters 1998  This sim is based on the last major German offensive in WWII. The speed and maneuverability of the fighters are slightly embellished towards the Axis aircraft, the German planes are given similar maneuverability to superior aircraft like the P-51, which makes for fair battles on either side. Flyable aircraft are limited to the Spitfire, P-51, P-47, P-38, Bf-109, Fw-190, and Me-262. Many Axis and Allied bombers like the B-17 are included, but they are non-flyable. There is a big selection of tanks, ground vehicles, buildings, and other objects on the mission builder, which is very easy to use. Massive tank battles can be created in just a few seconds by placing  tank divisions on the map. The V-1 Flying Bomb is also on the mission builder. There is also the ability to set an infinite combination of trigger points, which are invisible values, times, and conditions that can cause an action like making more planes appear, or anything else you can think of. The sim has pretty good graphics, though there are almost no trees and the ground is completely flat except for a few buildings and mountains. There is only a small area of land that is modeled, and no water or ships at all. AI is very good, even the best pilot can be shot down by a rookie fighter if hes not careful. Tanks dart away when shot at by planes, but just sit there when other tanks attack. The menu is very fun and easy to use, great user interface. The menu  music is catchy and true to the time period. In-flight music is somewhat annoying. You can learn a lot from the narrated documentaries on each aircraft. All in all pretty realistic, defiantly the best combat flight sim from the 90s.  Pros: Fair graphics, Great selection of ground vehicles, Great mission builder, Great AI, Awesome menu with elevator music, Awesome user interface  Cons: Graphics inferior to newer sims, not enough flyable aircraft, no water or ships, no trains, ditzy tank AI, aircraft AI always wants to fight you head on! (Be careful)  What sets it apart: Great AI, Great mission builder.  Janes Attack Squadron 2002  This sim is based on the bombing raids and air-to-ground attacks of the western front. All aircraft are flyable, including three heavy bombers, the B-17, B-24, and Avro Lancaster with their many bombardier and gunner positions! There are only a few different kinds of tanks, trains, and ships. The physics editor and mission builder appear to be the best ones yet, with waypoint markers, 1 million square miles of detailed terrain to work with, and even terrain sculpting! The only problem is that they are very complicated, and the help and read-me files are corrupted do to a programming error. The full mission builder and physics editor are unsupported by the company, and cannot be found anywhere. So much for the mission builder. There are only 6 pre-made missions, which are pretty good but boring after 12 times. The quick mission builder is good, with multiple aircraft, enemy aircraft, target, weather, and time settings, although you cannot select location or direction and are limited to 32 aircraft. With this you create awesome bombing missions, with formations of bombers attacking massive, detailed cities, with defending fighters swarming around. Terrain graphics are relatively good, but defiantly an improvement over Janes WWII fighters. Buildings are very detailed, from houses and hangers with individual windows, to massive factories and even small sky scrapers. Bomber details are pretty good, but fighters are kind of boxy with less curves. Damage modeling is great, bullet and flak holes appear when hit. The fighter AI is good, though not quite as good as WWII Fighters. The bomber AI, however, is superb. Bombers fly in close formation without ever crashing, (Imagine that!) and gunnery accuracy is better than any other flight sims bombers. Set to aces, a formation of 6 B-17s can shoot down a Bf-109 in less than 5 seconds! Ground vehicles, tanks, and ships have no AI whatsoever, and just go through their waypoints no matter what. The menu is very easy to use, and the menu music is not too annoying. The intro and in-flight music are cool.  Pros: Good graphics, Ability to fly all bombers, Great bomber AI, Good user interface.  Cons: Graphics inferior to newer sims, bad aircraft graphics, bad selection of ground vehicles, unusable/way-to-hard-to-use mission builder.  What sets it apart: Ability to fly the B-17, B-24, and Lancaster and control gunner positions.  Ubisoft IL-2 Sturmovik (1946) 2006  This sim includes all of the previous IL-2s made by Ubisoft before 2006, so any other ones like IL-2 Forgotten Battles and Pacific Fighters are not necessary. IL-2 1946 includes most of WWII on the Western front, the Pacific front, but focuses on the Eastern Russian front. The 1946 portion focuses on an alternate timeline in which all the major leaders like Roosevelt, Stalin, and Hitler have died and the new leaders send their countries into vastly different paths than those of reality. The war continues into 1946 where both Allies and Axis have advanced rocket and jet aircraft. Some U.S.S.R. aircraft are even as advanced as the MiG-15, some even more. German late-war prototype aircraft like the Go-229 have materialized and are used in combat. Even guided missile technology is available. I have to admit, that at first, I was a bit skeptical since IL-2 1946 was designed in Russia. It turns out that as I suspected, IL-2 is significantly embellished towards the U.S.S.R., (I wonder why?) with more Russian aircraft than U.S., British, and French aircraft combined. But when I realized what else IL-2 had to offer, I knew this was the best combat flight sim of all time. IL-2 includes over 400 different aircraft from the USSR, US, Britain, France, Germany, Norway, Finland, Romania, Slovakia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, and more! At least 250 of these are flyable, including: The A-20, B-25, P-38, P-39, P-40, P-47, P-51, P-63, YP-80, F2A Buffalo, SBD Dauntless, F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, F4F Corsair, Hurricane, Spitfire, Tempest, Beoufighter, Mosquito, I-153, I-16, Mig-3, Yak-3, Pe-2, and so many more that it would take a whole page to fit them. Many non-flyable never-before-modeled aircraft are present also, like the massive Me-323 6-engined transport, Ju-88 Mistel flying bomb, Fw-200 Condor, and many more. There are hundreds of different meticulously detailed tanks, vehicles, and warships. One of my favorite things about IL-2 is that the Pacific front of the war is included, along with US Navy and Japanese carrier borne aircraft, a great selection of Japanese land-based planes, the B-29, (non-flyable. Boo hoo.) submarines, torpedo boats, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and many aircraft carriers. The mission builder is great, with 3D maps, condition settings, and infinite waypoint combinations. Tanks and other vehicles stick to roads when possible, but will go almost anywhere you program them to. The world is divided into separate smaller maps, which you can select. Many fronts are present, like Normandy, The Ardennes, Berlin, Gulf of Finland, Manchuria, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Midway, Hawaii, Moscow, and many more Russian maps. You can program waypoints for aircraft, tanks, and ships, and set the speed, altitude, direction, skill, paint job, gun accuracy, firing rate, and more. The missions are good, but you will find that you will enjoy making your own missions much more. The aircraft, vehicle, ship, building, sky, ocean, and terrain graphics are all unparalleled by any other sim, with outstanding detail from huge forests of 3D trees and rocky mountains, to super detailed buildings and tanks with words even visible on the sides! You can even see personnel at their positions on ships! The AI for everything is incredible, enemy aircraft know advanced maneuvers, tanks aim their turrets and fire at enemies, and ship turrets and flak guns fire accurately at targets. However, IL-2s user interface is lousy. The menu is boring and has tiny buttons for everything, but this is nothing compared to the quick and full mission builders. For over 350 aircraft, and a few thousand other vehicles, buildings, and objects, there are tiny drop down lists which you must scroll through to select anything. The scroll bar is 3/16ths of an inch wide, (I kid you not!) and is so short that it takes about 30 seconds to get your curser centered over it. When zoomed in to a map, it switches to 3D mode for the entire terrain, so this will slow down your computer and curser significantly unless you have a high-end graphics card. Between this and the scroll bars of death, it is almost impossible to do anything on the mission builder without a good mouse. My cousin owns IL-2, and he can hardly move his curser at all on the mission builder. The frame rate in flight is about  to 2 frames per second, (F.P.S.) which is horrible. Target F.P.S. is usually about 20 F.P.S.. This is probably because his graphics card is outdated. However, I have a very old IBM ThinkPad laptop with Windows XP, and IL-2 works just fine on it. If possible though, you want a high-end graphics card, and a large screen. The intro music is pretty cool, but when you hear the main menu music, you will burst out laughing. It sounds like circus music, or something from a corny cartoon. But, amazingly, IL-2 gives you the ability to change system files, unlike most other sims, so you can switch the circus music with something less annoying. There is also the issue of swearing. The box says it includes mild swearing, but I would debate that. At some points, it seems like all the pilots ever say is the same swearword over and over, which is not realistic anyways since Japanese, German, Russian, and French pilots wouldnt speak English. But, luckily, again you can change this in a notepad system file called conf.ini, by changing the noswearing: value from 0 to 1, and save. I really appreciate the ability to change system files on this sim, you can fix many of the annoying problems once and for all. All in all, this is the BEST combat flight sim my friends or I have ever seen, defiantly a must-have for WWII airplane buffs. Since IL-2 1946, Ubisoft has come out with more combat flight sims, I have not bought any of these yet, though.  Pros: Incredible graphics, Ability to fly many medium bombers, Amazing selection of flyable and non-flyable aircraft, Great AI, Many war fronts available, Awesome ships. Ability to change system files.  Cons: Cant fly heavy bombers like the B-17, B-24, B-29, etc, Russian embellishment, Bad user interface, Runs slowly on older graphics cards.  What sets it apart: Unmatched graphics and realism, Huge selection of aircraft, tanks, vehicles, and ships.

I don't much care for the bland monotone accents of the characters,  I think they could have done a better job with the acting.  The scenery is very realistic and nice.  I love that the lead character is a female and that the game relies heavily upon her wits via Nostradamus' guidance.  That is too cool but of course most likely did not occur given the time period and setting.

354,227619,4,False,"09 5, 2012",A3MZU8A1ASX8X2,B004K1EA5G,J. Sherman,"After owning it for over a month, I can say with confidence that this is the best fighting game for the 3DS next to Super Street Fighter IV.  And it's not because of the fighter's boobs!  Well, . . . not JUST because of that.  The first game from their sexy franchise exclusively on a Nintendo console, Team NINJA made sure to make every hit count.  Everything jam-packed into this single inch-and-a-half game card screams DOA; the pummeling fists and feet, the hazardous multilevel arenas, the precision timing for throws and holds, and yes, the roster of (mostly) vivacious femmes fatales and the hypnotic sway of their gravity-defying 'attributes'.  Graphics do make the game, after all.  Along with the mandatory gaming modes DOAD throws in a few extras to make the experience unique.  First up is ""Chronicle""--part-story-mode, part-tutorial--which compresses the stories of the first 4 DOA titles while teaching players the basics.  The plot itself is nonexistent, the cutscenes are beautifully animated one minute and stagnant the next, and DOA facts posted on the touch screen distract players from the action.  But you'll still want to check it out because button-mashing can only take you so far.  Another exclusive feature, ""Tag Challenge"", pairs you with another contender in handicap or tag matches.  But overpowered opponents, less-than-capable AI-controlled partners, and major balance issues ultimately ruin the experience.  DOAD also makes the best use of StreetPass and SpotPass with its ""Throwdown"" mode.  While Street Fighter has figurine battles and Tekken has trading cards, in Throwdown the 3DS uses the data of other players to create an avatar you can fight with.  Even if your internet lags and you're the only kid on your block who owns this game (Like me), if you've got wifi, you're good.

However, not being one to fork over full price for a title, I waited for the inevitable price drop. The game is awesome.  Truly worthy of its lineage.

Not being much of a Tekken fan, I wasn't thrilled.  At least everyone gets the new McFarlane character, Necrid.

364,334712,4,True,"10 17, 2014",A10W2QTBTVV6RQ,B00GLZQR96,Jessie Scott,"What started out as a boring, arcade-esque game when first released has turned into an enjoyable, loot grabbing adventure.  For those of you who were disappointed with the original release, the expansion, ""Reaper of Souls"" gives us a new class and Blizzard also rolled out a ""Loot 2.0"" system as part of the update (it was a free update, expansion wasn't required).  Finally you have a multitude of worthwhile items to collect and use.  This simple change completely turned the game around (along with other patch improvements).  With the Ultimate Evil Edition, we have the expansion plus the base game, meaning 6 classes, 5 Acts, and several new modes (including a feature exclusive to consoles currently).  Controls: For PS4, the game fully utilizes all buttons on the gamepad.  As you level up, you'll unlock new skills which will be assigned to the different buttons (until all are being utilized).  So much, in fact, that at times I've forgotten to use some of my skills in chaotic battles.  The left stick moves you and the right stick has you doing a slow dodge.  I've personally not found much use of dodge, as enemies seem to hit me anyway, but I just have them roll around for fun or to break breakables.  The menu takes a little getting used to, as it's on a radial-dial where you scroll through your various equipment locations (e.g. head, body, hands, rings).  Once you get used to it, it doesn't really take too much time, but if you're playing with others you may have to wait for them to finish.  You can also mark items as ""junk"" to sell with a click of a button.  I found myself not using this feature, though it is there.  When an item drops and you pick it up, you also have the ability to quickly equip or mark as junk.  Once picked up, 3 categories with green up arrows (meaning better stats) or red down arrows (for lesser stats) will show on the screen.  I never use this feature, as there are a lot of nuances with gear and I'd prefer to look at them one by one.  Gameplay: The basic premise of the game, for those unfamiliar, is run through each location killing all enemies you see using a variety of powers.  Said enemies drop items, collectively known as ""loot"", upon dying which make your character stronger.  This is the addictive cycle of the Diablo games - collect loot, level up, get new skills, kill more enemies with different skills, repeat.  The maps are well put together, but unlike the previous entry, the maps have randomized elements, but aren't truly randomized.  That is probably one of the biggest flaws in my opinion, as the changing maps gave the previous Diablo infinite replayability and that feeling of discovery.  Once I visited an area, I knew exactly where the important stuff (and boundaries) would be any time I went through again.  You have several classes to choose from: the hardy and furious Barbarian, the stoic and martial Monk, the dark, ranged Demon Hunter, the primitive and controlling Shaman, and the studious and magical Wizard from the base game, plus the stalwart and strong Crusader from the expansion (and my personal favorite).  Every class has a male and female variant.  You have access to unique skills and ""rune"" slots, which unlock at specific levels and customize each base skill.  For instance, the Wizard has a beam attack that can be changed into split beams with a rune, or to have a shorter but wider beam for close attacks.  It allows for flexibility and different builds, but you can't switch it on the fly. Unlike previous games, you can't create a Warrior Wizard who wades into combat swinging a sword, the Barbarian can't used ranged weapons, and the Demon Hunter is restricted to ranged only, considering all their skills required a ranged weapon.  This is one of the biggest flaws of the game, in my opinion, coming from Diablo 2.  I wanted to use the Demon Hunter as a shadow stalker, dual wielding knives or swords.  Sadly, you do not have a choice in this and have to play each class as Blizzard wants.  I haven't dove into Adventure Mode or Bounties as of this time, but after finishing the game you can go back and complete various objectives for rewards of items and experience.  Another feature is that if elite enemy kills a friend of yours, they become more powerful and can invade your game as well.  The more people who perish at the hands of this foe, the stronger they become but the greater the rewards are.  One of the great advantages of the console version is couch co-op play!  If you don't have a friend to join, you can find matches to join online as well.  There is an ""arena"" for Player vs Player combat, but otherwise you won't have to worry about someone invading your game wanting to kill you or otherwise ruin your game.  Graphics: The character models are not very pretty.  Once in game, everything looks nice, with great particle effects and lighting (though I feel like almost everything looks rounded).  Enemies heads can explode or be removed from their body (watching it fly through the air), zombies whose upper and lower half separate, only to have their upper half crawl towards you, and many other great animations and effects are present.  The game is zoomed out enough that the minor details that would look really low resolution up close appear fine.  The cutscenes are all top notch and beautiful, and each chapter introduction starts with story book like drawing/animation.  People complained that the graphics were too ""light"" or ""happy"", and while it's not as dark and gray as Diablo 2, it's still plenty dark and bloody.  The usual dark shadows are replaced by low, blue lights instead.  Grass is greener, water is bluer, sure, but these do not detract from the dark tone, with different areas having plenty of corpses lying about or torturing devices swinging from the ceiling. 0 Sound: The effects are great and each enemy makes different noises to set them apart.  The goatmen bleat as they charge you, zombies moan, ghosts make this swishy like sound.  The music fits the theme and mood well, with familiar style permeating each area.  I have no complaints with sound design.  Story: A star has fallen and you go to investigate.  From there, you'll meet faces familiar and new and uncover the secret of a growing terror.  For what the game is, the story is good, but nothing new.  Depending on how close you pay attention, you can probably see each plot twist or reveal coming.  The final act didn't leave me breathless, but it was more of a shrug and accepted that everything just happened.  It's Diablo, bad things happen because of powerful evil beings.  Online: Co-op is there in all it's glory, so invite a friend (or 3) and destroy the enemies of good.  The difficulty scales up as does the rewards.  You can gift or trade items you find as well.  I also already mentioned the elite enemy who kills your friend may find his way into your game looking to finish you off as well.  There is matchmaking for those who want to play with others but have no friends or have no friends available.  -------------------- Overall: 4/5 - With the Loot 2.0 system, it's fun to go out and slay monsters and power up your character.  The gameplay is solid and addictive, but not incorporating randomly generated maps and not allowing for full customization for characters is a step back.  This is technically the expansion with the base game included for free, but it's a great arcade-like action/RPG that will satiate a need to hunt for loot and slay powerful enemies - especially with friends (online or off). -------------------- Gameplay: Lots of skills to unlock, plenty of enemies to defeat, and more loot than you hold creates an exciting and addictive experience.  Removing random maps and shoehorning classes into very specific roles feels like a huge step back and gives you less control over a character's development and more of ""this is what Blizzard created and wants me to do"".  Controls: So many skills!  So many buttons!  It's easy to aim, shoot, use skills, run, and everything else you need to do.  The menu system takes some getting used to, but isn't too bad once you've experienced it for awhile.  Graphics: Zooming out means they can use lower resolutions, but anything close up looks muddy and out of the last generation era (maybe even farther back).  Particle effects and character animations are fantastic and fluid.  While the textures may be low quality, the rest of the game looks very fluid and nice.  Even if it's too ""bright"" for some.  Sound: Satisfying death throes and enemy war cries echo around you.  The music fits perfectly and helps set the mood/theme in every location.  Online: Fantastic Co-Op game play!

As a fan racing games this one may be on my top as far as the game having the most detailed customization to date. Its a bit more deep than midnight club LA in some areas and as far as the cars they added some amazing cars I haven't seen racing games add. As far as the graphics they're okay standard wise for a early ps3 game. The car handling, its a little similar to earlier midnight club games (somewhere between 2 and 3) its not the best either is it bad. It takes some time for adjustment. They added a new mechanic called DNA which lets other online players know what type of driver you whether cool, neutral or a hot headed type. Its a cool mechanic but this game is definitely no long online. Definitely a bit better than Need for speed's pro street.

With a 1gb card, I've got 2 or 3 45-minute to 1-hour videos, plus several hours of tunes (for when I'm walking or riding my bike and can't watch video), a small photo-album of family pictures to show my coworkers, and, yes, a game in the UMD slot. Seriously good to go for riding the train and bus around town to and from work.  So yeah, you can get by with a 32mb card, if you don't mind being very restricted in what you can do with your PSP.

Since she could play instantly at any time, she quickly realized that she couldn't just make the pipes too tall. Then she was so proud of herself and her sister when the 5 year old beat it.

We've been doing some online, but mainly looking for levels we can steal because they look interesting so we can download and then work on editing. There are online levels that are easy enough for the eight year old boy, but there are a lot of crazy, crazy levels too. I really feel like they need to add a few more broad categories.

Ive been on this game for awhile now, college has been a nuisance so the free time has been very slim.  I am finally on the last level and I am kind of annoyed.  The ONLY problem I found in this game was from time to time it can get annoying if youve been on it for too long.  Im also on the hardest difficulty, so that shot up the nuisance feeling pretty easily...but, sometimes a bunch of aliens come at you at once and either you have no ammo or you're very low on health.  So typically its impossible to kill 400 aliens (and they are very difficult to kill).  Thats the only thing that bugs me.  On the other hand, if there were barely any aliens at all (for example early RE games, N64, Playstation) after killing the aliens in that area they typically wouldnt show back up so the game got boring pretty quickly.  So its hard to point out what im saying exactly.  If you have a short temper and get annoyed easily and you play the game on Hard, youll know what im saying.  Overall, the game is amazing.

This because where your palm is going to rest depends on where you are going to position your thumb on the MMO keys. Unlike the Corsair Scimitar (which slides), the MMO buttons are locked in a fixed position.  Keymaps, its limited. Although you have up to 8 keymaps available, the physical button to keymap feature is flawed. Razer needs to let a button press cycle across the entire 8 keymaps instead of only going to one keymap. This forces you to use 8 buttons to get at each keymap (a waste). You are then forced to use Razer Synapse software to get to the right keymap.  Weight wise, this thing is a paper weight. They need a new design to reduce this by at least 20% with lighter materials. Realize this is not a normal mouse. It has stuff on it that makes it more heavier. This mouse is feels more heavier than my Corsair Scimitar Pro.  The biggest thing that I hate is that there is no nib sticking out on the 5 key. This is a critical mistake. All keyboards have nibs over the F and J keys for hand position. You need that nib to let you feel where the middle of the MMO grid is to avoid looking at the mouse.  In regards to lighting, its limited. You can't control each button color as all 12 buttons and the scroll wheel sync to the same color. Per button lighting can help you identify actions better by taking a quick glance at the grid. Staring at a grid full of the same color doesn't help at all - a useless feature. Use color to help in improving game play, that's what its for, not for aesthetics only. Also, there is no logo lighting - a missed brand opportunity.  For DPI sensitivity, this goes only up to 8200 DPI.

I kept trying to get into this game, but after getting a few chapters in I just found myself thinking that I do not care about this game at all and was wasting my time.

But when you first drive through the slums, you find this not to be the case. As a matter of a fact, it's quite the opposite. Welcome, ""friend"", to Liberty City, a hell-hole with shootings, gangs, and organized crime galore. The ideal place to carry out the American dream? Hardly.  Upon jumping into the game, you'll notice a definite change in graphics (if you've seen anything of the previous installments), tone, and realism. It's gritty, apparent, and really makes you feel like you're in a city. Cars screech by, people fight and argue with each other, bums sleep in dark alleyways and beg for money. Hey, there's even the occasional nut who babbles on about alien invasion.  Cool right? It gets better. People on the street can be seen using phones, MP3 players, and iPods. They smoke cigars and cigarettes, drink coffee, read newspapers, and converse with other pedestrians.  Some of the more dynamic things have also changed. A minute in the game lasts about four seconds now, shadows can be seen changing with the time, rain affects the performance of cars and causes the city to take on a different look, and HDR lighting makes the game all the more beautiful.  Phones, although previously used in some of the other GTAs, play a bigger and more important role than ever in IV. They are your link to the world and the people involved in it. You can text message, call contacts, take pictures, and more. You can even customize things like your ring tone, background, and phone type.  The Internet is one of the newest additions to the series. Niko can enter Internet cafes and use a computer to access the world wide web. He has an email address and he can register and use things like dating websites and forums. There are pop-ups, spam emails, and more. Better still, Niko can respond to certain emails.  Most of us who have played San Andreas will probably recall some of the games that could be played. IV brings them all back, plus a few new ones. Niko can bowl, play darts, shoot pool, and gamble. These activities are pretty much only used on dates, though. Diners and fast food places have also been brought back to the game. It's awesome, to say the least.  One of the newest features is the buddy system. To elaborate a little more on this, Niko can call up a person who is his friend and propose they do something together. He can ask them to play a game, go out for a drink, go get something to eat, and more. Hey, he can simply sit there and do nothing but talk with them if he wants to.  The drunk driving mini-games are a challenge, for two reasons:  1) The screen and car physics behave differently. 2) The Endorphin Physics Simulator causes Niko and his bud to frequently lose their balance.  You don't have to drive, however. The safest thing (unless you want to be arrested) is to just find a cab and call it over to you.  Comedy clubs, bars, amateur theatre plays, and nightclubs are some of the improved features. Rick Gervais actually supplied voiceovers for the comedy club skits, and they are actually pretty entertaining to watch. The theatres also offer plenty of entertainment. Different acts come up (jugglers, knife throwers, magicians, you name it) and they're hilarious.  Niko can also watch TV, go swimming, and of course listen to the radio (and I will spoil NOTHING about the radio).  You also have more freedom in IV. You can decide who lives or dies on occasion and who's side you will take. These choices can affect the outcome of the game... you've been warned.  With all these new features, you're probably thinking there's a hitch to the game, and there is. I'm going to be honest with you and say that yes, IV is not perfect, far from it. Let me clarify.  The Endorphin engine provides some of the smoothest and most realistic movements for Niko and other characters. However, it also causes some basic problems. Niko, when bumped, can stumble around and fall like a fool (he apparently has no way of controlling his balance). This gets repetitive and annoying after a while. It also causes the motorcycle physics to behave in a strange fashion. If Niko hits a bump even at a relatively slow speed, he will fly (yes, FLY) off and smash into the concrete. It takes him quite a while to recover, and the Endorphin AI isn't the brightest when you tell Niko to go back over and mount the bike. It might cause him to walk around in circles for a bit; it might do nothing. Depends. This gets frustrating, especially when you're playing a chase mission (if you fall off a bike on one of these missions, your chances of beating it on the first try are not good).  AI is also a bit of a harassment. The drivers seem to have no common sense when it comes the rules of the road, they will frequently get in your way when you're running or chasing someone, and they will run over Niko... a lot.  The missions in general get old pretty quick, too. They're all the same: go kill this guy or go find this vehicle and bring it back. Gun-play will be involved in every single one, rest assured of that. The cutscene briefings will tell you otherwise, but don't listen. EVERY SINGLE MISSION WILL INVOLVE NIKO SHOOTING SOMEONE... or he'll be the one getting shot at. You get the point. It makes for fun at first, but gets tiresome.  I have no other complaints or rants other than the mission dynamics could have been improved... slightly. Like I said, play one, and you've played them all.  While IV is a solid game, it does have a few dents and splotches here and there, like a bullet-riddled Mercedes under the Brooklyn Bridge with a grease-monkey's body in the trunk. However, it's fun and die-hard fans of the series will not be disappointed (I was quite satisfied). I would recommend it to most people, but not to beginners. I would advise them to try GTA III and then work their way up through Vice City and San Andreas (skipping some of the smaller games for the PSP and PS2). I wasn't disappointed, and I don't think you will be either... so buy it... What?

420,208627,4,False,"01 30, 2011",A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B00319DX4M,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"Enslaved is set in a post apocalyptic world many hundred years after a war wiped out our civilization. Monkey is a young man trapped on a slave ship, but when a girl named Trip escapes and the ship beings to crash Monkey gets out. To make a long story short both of them wakes up in ruins of New York, but Trip have secured Monkey with a headband which let her control him, with this she forces him to help her get home to her village, this is easier said than done as there are combat robots, called mechs everywhere and they want the main characters dead. The game play is much like a platformer, you climb, jump, activate levers and otherwise try to get from point A to point B through a obstacle course of a level. The game play is broken up by fighting sections as well as some puzzle solving. The game's gimmick is that you have to protect Trip, for if she dies, your character dies to, and at the same time Trip has her own set of skills which you have to put to good use in puzzle solving sequences.  Enslaved have both good points and bad points in my opinion. Let me mention the bad first. The game do not have the best controls, the button layout is a bit awkward and takes some getting used to. Also when I an my hubby played through this game there where a few times we encountered serious bugs. Enslaved is also very linear, that do not bother me, but if you want a game with multiple choices and endings you will not get that here. I also think the game could be longer, it is not so short as to make the player feel cheated, but it is not a very long game either. In addition I think the ending needed more flashing out. I am not going to spoil anything but the game leaves off with many questions unanswered. The gimmick of the game could be used better, most of the time Trip only run around babbling, there are a few times you have to save her and a few times you have to have her repair some technology or hack something to be able to progress, however most of the time she might just as well not have been there and the game developers have not been creative enough in using the fact that Monkey is enslaved to Trip though a science fiction control device to make the game play original.  Now to the good parts of the game. The storyline is extremely good and very involving, after a while I at least started to really care about these characters. The graphics, both on the player character, other characters and objects and backgrounds are superb, the mechs are just beautiful. The music is good and all in all I think Enslaved was allot of fun. The cutscenes are very well rendered and this is obviously a quality game.  Enslaved feels like if God of War married ICO, it certainly have some of the feel of both games and it is nearing excellence, however bad controls and a to sudden and cropped ending make it so I can not give this game five stars.

GTA IV and Episodes from Liberty City were both on sale on Steam for $10.  Thank GOD that I didn't pay full price for this game.  This is literally the most bug-ridden and frustrating PC game I have ever played.  The elements of a fun game are here: sandbox gameplay, interesting storyline and characters, guns, carjackings, all of the things that made previous GTA games great.  The good parts are just completely overshadowed by the fact that this game is a poorly developed console-port.  Installation requires registering with Steam, Windows Live and Rockstar Social network as well as passing two DRM checks. You have to sign into these programs EVERY SINGLE TIME you play.  Windows Live is required just to save your game.  I have never played a game that requires you two sign in on multiple programs and I never want to experience this again.  Its annoying, hogs computer resources, and is an insult to the user.  Its pretty ironic that these extreme DRM measures have done little to prevent piracy of GTA IV, you can find it on any torrenting website.  The other huge issue with this game is the number of bugs and poor performance.  This game stutters constantly, occasionally crashing to the desktop.  Other times, the game simply refuses to start.  I've spent time troubleshooting via Steam forums (many people who bought this during the Steam sale are having issues also, judging from the forums) and the best I have been able to do is to get the game in a semi-working state.  I'm really just tired of wasting my time.  The graphics are also noticeably worse than on the Xbox 360, despite the fact that I have them on high settings.  Keep in mind that my PC can play Bad Company 2, Starcraft 2, Company of Heroes, Fallout New Vegas, and Shogun 2 on High settings.  But my computer is unable to handle a game from 2008.

Although more of the emphasis has been around the Wii, and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite, the other systems still showed they had some light around for die hard gamers. That has been the case with great games like Need For Speed: Carbon, Madden '07, and especially the return of Link. Since the last major Zelda epic came out for the Gamecube a few years ago on The Wind Waker, eager Gamecube fans have wanted more. Twilight Princess made a smashing stand for the Wii as the premire launch title. Thankfully, Gamecube owners don't feel left out this time.  The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess has been a long time coming for the Nintendo Gamecube. It has been a long time coming but it was worth it. The gameplay follows Link as he goes on a journey, trying to battle the fierce Ganondorf who has caused trouble around Hyrule. In the story, Link is transformed into a howling wolf, and uncovers the mystery of the twilight. The gameplay and the storyline are absolutely gorgeous, and the surroundings are absolutely filled with life. The control is also a bit easier to pickup for Gamecube, compared to the Wii, where it is more about accuracy from the controller. There is one main disadvantage with Twilight Princess for the Gamecube, compared to the Wii version. The maps and levels are all mirrored to seperate the two versions from one another. In other words, if you had to go left to a certain point on the Wii, Gamecube players would have to go right, which to Gamecube edition owners might find a bit confusing if they've bought the strategy guide Nintendo made.  Despite that one big difference, The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess marks the near end of the Gamecube era, but it remains one must buy for die hard Zelda fans that is worth the effort. If you own a Gamecube, or the Wii, and you can't find the Wii edition, than I definitely recommend the Gamecube version. This is one that the tri-force is behind Link for eternity.

445,134136,5,True,"04 25, 2010",AH4NVZ8XSGOHY,B0014UGK4U,Ken,"I've had Red Faction: Guerrilla (RFG) on my wish list for several months now.  It looked different than most games I play, so I decided to experiment and give it a try.  Before buying, there was the pesky matter of deciding whether to get the XBOX 360 or Windows version.  I have a fairly high end pc (Win7 64bit, i7 920@ 3.5Ghz, GTX 295 video card), so I decided to enjoy all the eye candy I could with the game.  The reviews are less than stellar for the Windows version (some mention failures to run on Win7), but I'm not scared by such talk.  I was talked into the XBOX version of GTAIV and regretted it after seeing it on Windows.  Installation was pretty straight forward and took 10 or so minutes to finish.  Upon completion of the main installation, it wanted me to install a chat client for gaming.  I went ahead and installed it since I planned to try out the multi-player features of RFG.  I haven't tried the multi-player portion yet, so I'm not sure if it is needed or not.  This was followed up my the game asking me to enter the serial number for activation (yeah, DRM stuff, but I don't care).  I entered the serial and fired up the game.  RFG uses Games for Windows Live, which is fine by me since I like trying to get the max amount of achievements I can.  I also don't mind being connected to the internet all the time because I'm not some crazy conspiracy theorist that is so paranoid of the internet that I physically unplug my cable modem when I'm not using it.  I already have GFWL installed, so I was all set there.  I fired up the game and GFWL also asked me to enter the serial number. GFWL found the latest update (from early April) and asked if I wanted to download and install it.  I accepted and closed RFG while it was downloading and installing the update.  Upon restarting of the game, I was able to start a new career and get going right away.  What ever problems they had before this patch in regards to Windows 7 64bit have been fixed.  I haven't had a single crash after 26 hrs of game play.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward and if you've played any GTA titles you will feel right at home.  Basically, you're job is to avenge your brother's death by killing all the EDF you can to liberate Mars.  This involves blowing things up, which is cool.  The perspective is in the 3rd person, which some folks don't like very much.  Control can be a little annoying when using a keyboard and mouse, so I just use my Xbox controller with this game.  So much like GTA, you have a few different styles of missions to complete.  You have primary missions, guerrilla actions (free hostages, defend site, attack site, carnage), transporter (steal vehicle and deliver to a safe house) challenges, and demolition master challenges to complete.  This gives you a nice variety of stuff to do while trucking through the campaign. The one major complaint I have about the game is there should be more walkers lying around to hijack.  They are a blast to use during assaults since you can flip cars like nothing and watch them start chain reaction explosions that send enemies and debris flying all over the place.  RFG uses the HAVOK physics engine and the GEOMOD 2 destructible environment graphics engine.  This combination results in a pretty intense and surreal experience when blowing everything up that you can get a demolition charge on.  The graphics are actually quite good...for it being on Mars.  There aren't trees everywhere, so the main eye candy in the game are the vehicles and explosions.  The vehicles are highly detailed and animated (especially the walkers).  Driving physics is very complicated and often frustrating due to the fact you can't steer when you're front tires are off the ground (duh).  Realism is where the Windows version shines.  It's very clear when watching videos from the PS3 version that they had to dummy down the physics for those ports.  The transporter help videos showed the vehicles not really bouncing around in response to the terrain.  It was very difficult to beat the Pro times for the achievements on transporter and demolition master challenges.  The downside to this technology is it clearly needs a near top of the line PC to run at near 60 frames per second.  My PC was a perfect match for this game, providing consistent 55-60 fps throughout game play.  One feature I thought was cheesy was the low quality cut screen and mission briefing videos.  These looked like they came from a computer game from 1998.  Overall, I was very happy with RFG.  It is probably one of the most addicting games I've every played.  It can be very repetitive, but what game isn't?

My problem-solving 12 year old, who could finish a mini game before I'd even figured out what the heck they wanted her to do, thought it was hilarious; my 9 year old 'worker' type (like me) watched with no desire to really play and, I think they've played it once since they received it a week ago, and have since then told me to sell it, but the reasons for that could be many, and with kids, who knows in a week they could love it again. I, myself, never would have bought it, and I never will play it, but it's still an excellent type of mini-games game of reflex and hand eye coordination mixed with humor if you find this genre amusing.

448,406529,5,False,"03 3, 2016",A1UQUDT2Q0YENM,B00Z9LUGPE,Michael,"Harvest moon has been in a rut for a while. The last Harvest moon, the Lost Valley (the not really Harvest Moon) took things in a new direction with land-form transformation, but lost most of the ""soul"" of a harvest moon game. The first Story of Seasons game, a true Harvest Moon sequel had the soul of Harvest Moon--but it felt like yet another clone than a new game. I remember when I played my first Rune factory on the Wii that I finally had something new for a Harvest moon game! After 5 Rune factories that were just more of the same, it got into a rut too... Well, PopoloCrois is definitely new! Like Rune Factory, it's farming and adventure. But it's turn based battles. It feels really fresh!  It feels more like a distant relative of a Harvest moon game--the farming is more like a game long side quest than a full course. There's no day/night, nor are there days of the week or seasons. Your crops can't die, but they won't ever get to harvest if you don't water them. It's still fun to grow crops, and a good way to make money. There are animals, mines, bug hunting, etc. There are girls to go after, but there's this princess who is your main squeeze so I'm not sure why the other girl relationships/friendships even exist? They will help you out for the relationship, but there's no marriage or kids. There's plenty of stuff to do, but all the systems are simple--nothing is terribly deep.   I understand that the art style follows a series and anime in Japan, but it's very new over here. It's not your normal anime look, so it feels fresh, but very cartoony. The 3d models aren't very detailed, but every person has a pronounced look so it's easy to tell everyone apart. The anime cutscenes are often short but very well done. The almost isometric overworld looks really nice. It does feel like you're walking through a cartoon fairytale kingdom.  The battles are turn based on a grid. The grid doesn't add much strategy, but you have to go around obstacles on the field. So far it's not very hard. I ramped up the difficulty and encounter rate and I still auto-battle the whole game. As long as you grind at the practice dungeons at your farm between new areas, there isn't much challenge. I'm still enjoying it, but it's very much a game I play while doing other things. This is a good starter rpg for my son. You have a party that changes a couple of times as the story goes along, but it's pretty much the same mix of battles.  The game takes a turn toward Animal Crossing rather than the challenge of Rune Factory. You're able to do what you want with little chance of failure in both farming and adventure. There's nothing wrong with a game like that, but you should know that's what you're getting.  In the end, it's a lighthearted game and that shows in every point. The story isn't too deep. The strategy isn't too deep. The farming isn't too deep. But I'm enjoying the game and the pace and the variety. I do think they could have fleshed out either the farming or the fighting a little more and improved the game with more ""meat on the bones"".

456,155952,3,False,"04 30, 2012",ANQUC4ZM40ZU9,B00140P9BA,Final Fleantasy 15,"So keep in mind I played this game for the first time shortly after Mass Effect 3 came out. So I'm reviewing this game on face value and not taking into account how this game has aged or how it may have compared to games back when this was released. As always my video game reviews revolve around 3 things. Story, Gameplay, and characters with order of importance in that order. For reference I played this game on Steam.  Story: 7/10  The story was great. As usual Bioware does a good job on the story and the progression. It kept me interested all the way through. The difficult decisions without the knowledge of how it would impact my future was greatly appreciated and provided another level intensity. The constant irritation with political motives versus what is good for the galaxy kept things interesting all the way through. There really isn't anything to criticize about the story. It wasn't completely epic or anything but just a good overall story. Like I said it kept my interest. Was it the best story ever? No but it was good.  Gameplay: 5.5/10  This may be the weakest portion of the game. It's possibly because this section has not aged well but there are several weaknesses to the game. The mining for minerals portion of this game was rather boring and really was just a giant time suck. The number of items you picked up in this game was ridiculous. You were constantly picking up weapons and armors and upgrades to the point where they just became way too much to deal with and you were tempted to just sell everything to clear room. While the weapon system wasn't too bad, the ammo system was awful. You had to constantly switch back and forth between different types of ammo depending on what type of enemy (synthetic vs. organic) you were fighting. And when you have 50 different ammos..it can be rather difficult to swim through all of them to find what you want. Overall the gameplay wasn't awful and for the timing of the release it may have been really good...but after a while some of the elements of the gameplay just became taxing and distracting  Characters: 7/10  The characters weren't overly bad but weren't overly good either. My favorite characters were easily Wrex and Tali with Garrus being pretty good as well. However, the human characters, with shephard included, were just overly boring. Williams was the best of the three but to a larger degree all three playable humans were just stale. Shephard was almost robotic as far as emotions at some points. Character development was average. Some characters had really interesting backgrounds while some were snooze fests. Some characters were so boring an uninteresting that I couldn't force myself to care about their backstory (here's looking at you alenko). The supportive characters were pretty good..namely joker. Overall the characters weren't awful but weren't really noteworthy either.  Overall: 6.5/10  Overall this game was pretty good. If you can get through it before some of the gameplay elements start to really tax you, this game is rather enjoyable.

457,36959,4,False,"05 26, 2011",A36UKFV79879MD,B00006F2ZR,BX Lounger,"A year after the good, but flawed, Castlevania: Circle of the Moon was released on the Game Boy Advance, Konami went back to work and released its sequel (Harmony of Dissonance) in 2002. Fans of the Castlevania series quickly picked this up and hailed it as an excellent follow up to the first game. Harmony of Dissonance is a great game and deserves to be in everyone's GBA game collection.  This time around you control Juste Belmont, a descendent of the famous Simon Belmont in his quest to collect Dracula's relics in order to save a friend of yours trapped in Dracula's castle. Just like the last game, you explore a brand new castle, filled with traps and enemies. Armed with your whip, you can acquire weapons and items to help you find your way while you level up, RPG style to become stronger. This game does away with the cards you collected from CotM and instead uses a ""Spell Fusion"" system: spells you now can collect around the castle and use them in conjunction with any weapon you possess for new ways to attack your enemies. Save your progress from using any of the save rooms in the castle or use the new quick save option to temporarily save your settings until the next time you play. The game gives you 3 separate save slots so you and your friends can save each one's progress.  The PROS: HoD blows Circle of the Moon out of the water!!! Outside of the ""Spell Fusion"" system and quick save option, HoD plays similar to the awesome PS1/Saturn title, Symphony of the Night. That's right; the overall presentation, graphics, sound effects and animation are excellent and easily trumps the likes of CotM. Controls are of course spot on and for those who dread waiting to save until they reach a save room will welcome the quick save option with open arms. The ""Spell Fusion"" system adds more depth to the game play, making it cool to see what happens when you combine Juste's weapons with the spells you find. When you're done exploring the castle, you unlock another one so beating this game will take you awhile. Only by beating both castles will you be able to access the bonus modes.  The CONS: The music. Castlevania games always excelled in this area as it is responsible for having one of the best game soundtracks in the history of gaming. It's not that the music doesn't follow in the same tradition because it's pretty good. The problems lies in that it sounds like you are playing one of the classic 8-bit Castlevania games. MIDI sounding tracks have replaced the orchestral and electronic/guitar riff combo tracks that are common place since Symphony of the Night. They really feel out of place here and you wonder if Konami intentionally did this or not. Those looking to hear what Konami did for the music will be somewhat disappointed by the results.  Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance is easily better than Circle of the Moon.

So when God of War 2 came out that same year, I said to myself that I'd wait until I played God of War 1, before I started 2. So I bought the  PS2 versions to play at the same time that I purchased my backward compatible 60GB PS3. But the first game I ever tried was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B000B69E9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 4</a>.

Then...well I won't go on, but to make a long story short by the time I was ready to play God of War my 60GB PS3 had died and my new one isn't backward compatible.

After playing so many 'next gen' games released for the PS3 (if you care to see my list go to the link in the first comment on this review), when I put God of War into my PS3 I was expecting to see a game that was not up to the standards of most of the games that I've played to date. I mean, it was made in 2005 for the PS2....How could it live up to today's standards? Well anyone who's played God of War knows the answer to that, and I'm here to say that anyone who has a PS3 and has never played the God of War Collection NEEDS to buy this package.  I'm not a big fan of timed button presses and button mashing; I mostly just like shooting, but man am I having fun with God of War 1. I think that my gaming horizons have officially been broadened. God of War 1 is one well put together game. Remember the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B00005JKO7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>&nbsp;(with its remake scheduled for 2010)? God of War is that but you're IN the movie. You are Kratos, a former captain in the Spartan army who sets out to kill the God of War Ares. And there will be blood!  The story is well told and flows like a well written book (or movie!). There are tons of cool mythological monsters and you get a fair selection of weapons to kill them with. The repetitiveness of battling some of the same monsters throughout the game is limited by some of the ways that you can execute...well...executions. The kills often look a little different depending on which weapon or brutal attacks you make. Ah, yes, nothing like ripping the privates off of an anatomically correct ogre!  The graphics are fabulous and have been ""cleaned up"" and presented in 720p for the Collection. There's no Dolby or DTS surround sound for GoW 1, but that doesn't take away as much as I thought that it might, and anyone that doesn't have a 5.1 or better sound system won't notice a thing.  And hey!...now there are trophies for the games with the Collection. There's a trophy in the GoW Collection for finishing GoW I in less than 5 hours. I just hit the 5 hour mark and I still have half the game left to complete. If you can finish either of these games in under 5 hours you truly are a God. No, there are hours of entertainment in these games. I'd estimate 20 hours between both games combined for the average gamer. Gamers that have been through the games and know where to go and how to solve some of the puzzles/tasks might have a chance at that 5 hour trophy.

464,127617,4,True,"05 19, 2008",A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B0010EF0UK,R. Pickman,"First of all, this is a must play. It seems as more and more developers weigh into the gaming industry, ironically, it becomes more and more rare for one of them to bring something new to the table. Sony, as per usual, comes out of left field with this gem.  Part rythm, part puzzle, part rpg, Patapon mashes together bits and pieces of several genres. It's a shallow dash of each, but it's there, and it works. The design is simplistic and flat, but it's beautiful. Nothing seems out of place in this world. If you've read other reviews you probably know the premice of the game. You build an army of little cyclopian soldiers of various jobs and abilities and march them through their enemies to the promised land. You create your armies from the ground up by combining various materials you get from mini games and missions. The creation screen will place the default ingredients (two for each type of patapon.) but you can replace these with higher quality items you've found to make more powerful Rarepons. You'll also get better equipment to outfit your armies in while on your missions. Patapons are controlled by using an 8 beat rythm using a combination of the Cirle, Triangle, Square, and X buttons. You play four beats, the patapons sing their reply for four beats and so on. The catch is there's a tempo you have to follow, your button presses must match with the beat flashing around the border of the screen. Keep up well enough and/or hit a high enough combo and they'll enter fever mode. Fever greatly increases the Patapons attributes. Miss a beat though and you're back to normal Patapons until you can pick it up again via combos. It can be difficult at first but you'll find yourself intuitively stringing the various command beats together and watching your patapons follow your directions flawlessly. The beats are simple but very catchy, you'll find yourself randomly Pata-pata-pata-poning in your head. It has a nice system of combining various materials to make various kinds and shapes of patapons. The story is simple but you find yourself really caring about leading these little eyeballs to their promise land. Lastly it's truly a rewarding site when your little army enters Fever mode and volleys barrages of spears and arrows at your enemy and your warriors crush through the front lines toppling towers and buildings alike. All while singing in unision your praises.  This isn't a perfect game though. There's hardly any tutorial, I'm not sure if they just wanted to invoke a trial and error element to the game or if they were just too lazy to flesh out all the mechanics. For instance, say you pick up a really quality piece of meat and some rare metal (required to make the warrior type patapons) and you want to use them to make a Rarepon. That's all well and good if you don't have a full regiment of warrior Patepons. If you do though, it will simply tell you that you can't make any more of that type. Now there are bosses that will eat your Patapons rendering them irrevivable, but trying to strategically get a boss to eat the right Patapon and ONLY the right Patapons would be an exercise in catastrophe, and a large chunk of wasted time. I had to skim through a walkthrough on the internet to find out how to delete unwanted Patapons so I could create better ones. You have to go to the item equip screen, to get there you have to select a mission to go on first. Then you have to press Triangle over the correct regiment, highlight the patapon you don't want. Now you'd think that there would be an option to ""Retire"" the Patapon or even ""Kill"" Patapon... No, the button you have to press is Select, conveniently labeled ""Quit"". Silly me, not realizing that Quit meant get rid of highlighted Patapon. Instead I assumed that Quit meant Quit the game, or Quit the item selection phase... Another issue is the items that enemies drop. Most of it is completely useless after you've started making Rarepons as you don't use the generic meats, wood, and stones anymore. Rarely do any gear or weapons drop. When they do, they're only there for a short amount of time before they dissappear, and not into your inventory, they're gone for good. So say a nice weapon drops, but when you killed the enemy he bounced back puting him behind the rest of his soldiers. You better hope that they fall back or you kill them all quick otherwise you can just wave goodbye. If a boss drops an item behind him when he dies and the mission says complete before you walk over it, you lose it as well. You can watch your happy little eyeballs parade by shiny loot and heaps of cash without any one of them picking it up. The mini games are fun but the items you receive from them can become outdated very fast if your bolstering your ranks with Rarepons rendering said games pointless. On top of that, while they're fun the first couple times,each game is the same thing every time. It's a ""song"" that you have to mimic or play along with and it's the same song with the same beat and you just do the same thing every time. I can literaly listen to the mini games at this point and complete them without looking at the screen. There's also alot of repetition. You need to go back and do the same farming runs through the same stages several time to gather materials (you'll rarely get the ones you need) and money to make troops. Most farming missions yield around 200-250 Ka-ching! (money) and each of the 2nd best Rarepons cost 1k to 1.5k to make. That's 200-250 Ka-ching! if no monsters block you from being able to pick up the coin dropped by their dead counterparts. The last thing isn't really the games fault, it can just be frustrating. This game requires alot of concentration and if the TV's on or your significant other or a friend is trying to talk to you or the phone rings you'll find yourself getting off beat and losing Fever ALOT. Yeah, there's no pause either. Once you start a mission you need to finish it, quit, or die to stop it. Even when I'm alone I generally play with headphones as the PSP speakers don't carry the drum beat all that well all the time, plus it cuts down on the distractions. Personally I have a nice pair of Skullcandy Hesh that I use. They have great sound, they're comfortable, and they block out alot of the outside noise even if you don't have them cranked.  In closing, this is a game that you don't want to miss out on. It's at a bargain bin price right now, and you don't find anything this original very often.

You can interact with the terrain in amazing fashion giving you lots of freedom. Use crevices, door and window frames, landings, etc to climb just about anything you want. AC lets you ride a horse and fight from a mount.  The combat in AC is fun. It takes a little while to get use to, but once you do watch out. You must use timing and defense to avoid death when faced with overwhelming odds. As you continue the game you get access to new weapons and fighting skills. Before long you can do amazing counter-attacks, dodges, and grab and defensive breaks. The action is very fluid and thoroughly engaging.  Without giving too much away, the storyline is entertaining and will keep your interest. There is a duel storyline going where a modern day guy is reliving the memories of his ancestor. I found this part unnecessary, but it didn't detract from actual game. Yes, the whole premise of the game is assassinating people. So, no, the game is not for kids, hence the mature rating. Several reviewers have described the game as slanted towards killing Christians. It's not. It's really more killing everyone Muslim or Christian that gets in the way. However, the game does have it out for the Templars. They are portrayed as evil villains in the game. Most of the people you are sent to kill think they are serving a good cause, but their actions are misguided. Much like the actions of the main character.  Some things I didn't like. While you have tremendous freedom to interact with the terrain, you can't do some simple things like open doors. Also the environment is not destructible except for rare exceptions like vendor carts. You don't have many items / weapons at your disposal that could cause much damage, but rails could break, tables move, open a chest etc. Maybe I want to set a fire as a distraction. Oh well maybe next time.  I didn't have any problems with game stability. I don't think it ever crashed which is saying a lot these days.

In general the story is pretty average, good enough to keep me falling asleep but certainly not anything great. The voice acting is abnormally fast and certainly hurts the overall experience. I was also disappointed that this title has very little in common with the console titles, particularly plot wise. I find that a little perplexing considering how great the universe in the Suikoden series is (with the exception of the half finished IV). Also occasionally there's not well defined direction. Oftentimes you will have to basically ""Search"" your base or other areas to trigger story progression.    In a pretty big change the title focuses on missions. Many missions are ""accepted"" and ""completed"" as natural story progression, which is still pretty linear. You can also accept additional quests, many of which result in recruiting additional stars of destiny (Collecting all 108 is a huge nonsensical chore with little reward - often times you must do something during a certain season, with a certain character in your party or without a certain character).    The characters in general are pretty disappointing. I'm usually not one to bash customization but I actually think the change from weapon upgrading to purchase hurts the overall experience and makes a lot of the characters kind of blend together. When you have such a huge selection of characters to choose from it makes a lot more sense for them to have fairly well defined roles.    Gameplay wise this is a solid RPG. Not bad at all for a hand held title. This is very much typical Suikoden or turned based Final Fantasy fare done well. You have alot of different options for party setup and choosing what spells or magical attacks to equip characters with (similar to the rune system of the console Suikodens). This is by far the best aspect of the game, even if the difficulty level is pretty low.    The graphics are also nice (very reminiscent of Final Fantasy III (Japan) - The DS release)    In short if you're looking for good classic turned based combat on a hand held this is a good choice however if you're looking for anything ground breaking or that has anything to do with the Suikoden universe than this game is going to disappoint you.

The game has an excellent story, really top notch graphics (at least the environment), perfect sound (both music and sound effects), and a ton of replay value.

It brought us some of the classics (Sonic the Hedgehog, Altered Beast), and gave us a feel of what games could be like (Shining Force II, Earthworm Jim).  If you're wondering why the Genesis is held in such high esteem, all you need to do is look at its extensive library of games. The early titles were marginal (including the original pack-in game ""Altered Beast"") but the quality increased over time. The system excelled in platformers, shooters, and most of all, sports titles. Compared to their Super Nintendo counterparts, Genesis sports titles didn't look as sharp or sound as clear, but they played far better. Due to its sizeable library and excellent packaging, the Genesis is an ideal system for collectors. Individual cartridges are inexpensive, and it's not difficult to find complete games in great condition. The variety of games will satisfy any taste, although shooter and sports fans will especially be drawn to the system. The Genesis systems themselves are also very commonplace and inexpensive.

487,207295,3,False,"12 17, 2010",A2CHFDKZ07QM2X,B002TDIEEK,limquli,"This was a game that I would have loved, however there are too many flaws.  I can understand how other people like it though, but for me, it's a just average.  Somewhat of a dissappointment.  The Good: 1.  Great graphics.  I like the rendering styles used. 2.  Great selection of characters 3.  Sound effects fit the game well 4.  Great variety of moves for each character. 5.  Multi-player is great in general, assuming you can find someone of the same level as you to play with.  But tough luck for newbies, most of the players know their stuff and newbies won't stand a chance.  Yes you learn as you play but the gap is sometimes way too much so get ready to eat the floor 90% of the time.  To top it off, there are some ""mature"" players out there who would even msg you that you suck.  The Bad: 1.  AI is very very bad.  AI is unplayable, actually it is but it's a complete waste of time.  AI will do moves which are impossible for human players to pull off.  I don't get it, players are asked to do the moves in certain ways but it does not apply to the AI.  To pulloff Blanka's move you need to hit punch multiple times, the AI Blanka will just go up to you and counter your move with an electric shock, without any indication of him punching.  Wow!  Also, the AI is like a stupid puzzle, what beats the AI will often times not make sense.  For example, when you fight Cammy, she will most likely counter every move you do with her anti-air move, but if you just sit in a corner and wait and keep jabbing you will win.  Stupid.  Most AI will have you do the same move over and over and you will win.  Again stupid.  Street Fighter is not a new game, from what I've heard there should be plenty of great players out there and Capcom could have used some of those as template for great AI.  Now I know some of the critics will say just play online.  Well I've tried that and it has it's merits, but I have to rate this game as a whole, not just the multi-player experience and this one sucks so bad in the single player department.  2. Balance is terrible.  There are a lot of utterly useless moves for some characters but totally awesome for others.  There are stupidly angled kicks/punches.  Useless special moves like chun-li's regular spinning kick move.  If you take Ryu type characters, all of their moves are useful.  Also, if you learn combo's you will see that timing for some characters are way too easy (Ryu, Ken), and for some other character's it's way too hard.  For the life of me I can easily do a multi-hit combo using Ken, but the simplest 2 hit combos of Dhalsim is impossible for me.  Searched online and apparently I'm not the only one.  The question in my mind is why?  Why create a super hard to use character like Dhalsim?  The combo is not complex, Dhalsim is suppose to mid-kick and do his yoga flame.  Not even that powerful but impossible to do.  In contrast, I can simply shake the controller and hit punch and Ken can do a 4 hit Fierce punch to uppercut combo with loads of damage.  Fair?  3. Not newbie friendly, which is an understatement.  I had a couple of friends over and we played the game, none of them could pulloff any of the moves and we moved on to another game.  Compared to some other fighting games out there like SoulCaliber 4, my friends picked it up very quickly and we had fun.  So, overall not a pretty experience.  You get a stupid single player experience which gives you zero skill level improvement, and when you play online you cannot enjoy it because you will get beaten most of the time.

When it came out in the arcade system, people would gleefully dump coins into the system to play as one of two resurrected Roman centurions in hopes of beating the nefarious Neff in the underworld as they rescue Zeus's daughter Athena from peril.  Regrettably, those who had the original Sega Master System were likely sorely disappointed with the disjointed and disorganized gameplay that the title had on that platform.  The resolution?  Sega released it on Sega Genesis, where it played better than it did in the arcade (let alone Sega Master System) and allowed players the ability to customize the game's difficulty (there were control options that could enable a person to award or remove lives and health bars, in addition to setting the game difficulty.)  The game itself takes you through five different levels where your centurion battles a collection of ghouls, demons, zombies, and other unpleasant creatures that work to impede your progress.  As you battle through each level, you must obtain three orbs by vanquishing a blue Cerberus whenever it appears on the screen.  Once you obtain three orbs, you transform into either a Werewolf, a Weredragon, a Werebear, a Weartiger, or the ultimate creature, the Golden Werewolf, to defeat Neff and whatever form he takes to attempt to defeat you.  This continues until you finally vanquish Neff and save Athena.  When you beat the game, you get the credits and the option to play again but at a higher difficulty.  Beat the highest difficulty and you get to play again.  Not the greatest ending ever, but the gameplay makes up for it.  The controls are easy to figure out, but the gameplay is far from being a pushover.  The creatures have amazing abilities, but you'll need to push them to their maximum limit to make victory a possibility.  The moments are never dull and the soundtrack remains one of the most legendary in video game history.

I missed Secret of Mana back in the day so I was really looking forward to going back and playing this. I left it feeling pretty disappointed.  I think the heart of my complaint is I played it alone, while this is clearly a better game with friends. Friends can control other characters in your party, and that has always been a major draw for this game. Playing it alone feels like a really long escort mission, with two poorly programmed AIs following you around. They will stand behind you and play with their hair while a monster beats you to death. They will get stuck on walls and objects. Just a constant frustration.  Lets get to some positives. For a SNES game, the graphics really pop. Looks every bit as good as Chrono Trigger or any other high end RPG on the system. Music is pretty great. Combat has its moments, if frustrating in single player. Battles are in real time. And while you can see monster on the map, its often very hard to avoid fighting them. It actually felt more like random battles in that way. Each character builds up magic with weapons depending on how much they use them. And there are lots of weapons to choose from. So theres a lot of character customization, always great in an RPG.  I found the story rather dull. You are randomly told to save the world. Go collect Mana seeds chosen one. And thats pretty much how it goes for a long time. Eventually they do mix it up, but way too late IMO.  Pros  Excellent graphics and music for this generation Fun combat Massive world to explore (for the SNES anyway)  Cons  Feels like a giant escort mission when played alone Story is pretty lame  Yet some more complaints. The ring menu/combat system was frustrating. I constantly hit the wrong button for character. You often miss targets for various reasons, the enemy is a casting a spell, knocked down, just glitches. And theres quite a bit of slowdown, which also confuses things. And the final dungeon and boss battle was just plain agonizing. No save points and multiple bosses, along with a massive maze to navigate.  Its a good RPG for the time period, but it also makes a ton of rookie mistakes that subtract from the experience.

Durham,"Last year's Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 managed to come out of nowhere and end up being one of the best RPG's to ever grace the PS2.  Now, Atlus has unleashed this director's cut of sorts of the game, entitled Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES.  The game is broken up into two separate parts, entitled The Journey and The Answer.  The Journey is pretty much the original game with many noticable tweaks, enhancements, and new features; while The Answer takes place after the events of the original title.  The game retains the look of the original, and it still looks good; while the dialogue, story, and characters are memorable as ever as well.  Even if you have played through the original title, FES warrants your attention because of the ton of new content, and The Answer mode offers up more replayability.  Not to mention that given the bargain price tag, this game is basically a steal, even if you already own and have played through the original.  Let it be known though that the game does offer quite a bit of challenge amongst all the variety offered.  Casual gamers or those who don't spend much time with RPG's are not going to get the most out of the game, where as more devoted RPG'ers or fans of the series will find much to love here.  All in all, regardless of whether or not you played the original version of the game, Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES is a spectacular new vision of an already great RPG, and for old and new fans and RPG gamers alike, this game is a more than worthy pick up.","Spectacular, a great game is made even better",1208822400,51.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,look steal play manage much find quite rpg's enhancement character tag ever megami offer event nowhere come know worthy regardless noticable replayability title last get mode ton many journey pick great already unleashed vision fan entitle bargain tensei one offer persona love series new year's feature warrant original tweaks place answer retain gamers cut let separate go good shin dialogue grace bit price whether variety version time spend part fes alike game sort challenge still atlus attention casual even rpg'ers basically amongst memorable rpg break best devote two story old spectacular look mention though take content director's end well offer give pretty

There's things done right here, but there's plenty of missteps along the way. Most of what you expect is here. The plot is fluffy, you'll see plenty of Disney and Square characters, you have RPG-style advancement, and the game will take quite a while. The thing that surprised me most was that I wasn't expecting it to use platforming so much. I like platforming games (such as Mario or Rayman), but the platforming here was infuriating. There was a whole lot of drudgery in getting from place to place, which is never good. The fighting was generally fun, but wasting time going back and forth across a zone having to wait for loading multiple times is just irritating. There's still plenty of good gameplay here, however. Most of the boss battles are pretty good. However, the bad ones are very aggravating. In addition, the creators felt compelled to add in a water level, which is pretty standard in platformers. Unlike most platformers, though, they just wrote off breathing as happening magically, whereas in most platformers, one of the central facets of water levels is having to find oxygen bubbles. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes the water level feel even more pointless. It just ends up being the same old stuff except in water with annoying controls. There have been plenty of glowing reviews of this game written, which is why I've mostly avoided mentioning the positive aspects of the game. I did still give it 4 stars, and don't think that I believe Kingdom Hearts to be a bad game. I think it's a decent game, but I also think that it's been vastly overrated by many gamers, and I want to make sure that those looking at buying this game don't get their hopes up wishing for a perfect game when the game exhibits some very clear flaws.","Good game, but greatly over-hyped",1041811200,2.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,surprised give fluffy bubble much oxygen use find quite i've character creator way plot like positive fighting drudgery however level generally loading add aggravate perfect think vastly one magically time put get hop many thing overrate expect wait waste take addition sure buying multiple feel fan glow unlike happen compel fun central star thing write judge that's one square franchise lot back annoy control rayman place right infuriate gamers whole go believe good necessarily merit advancement platformers exhibit stuff game want across time flaw game actual mostly write happy standard bos level irritate bad game felt also pointless decent still end mario see even water plenty forth license except aspect misstep mention avoid breathe make never kingdom review zone whereas pretty facet along old gameplay though heart battle make there's wish platforming expect disney get do look rpg-style clear rather

529,50621,3,False,"03 23, 2012",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0000C0YW2,Aiex Halo,"I haven't played a Sim City game since SimCity 2000.  I was just a kid then, but I was still able to maintain some stability with the cities, even though most of my zoned buildings ended up abandoned quickly.  I played SimCity3000 for a few hours shortly after, and now close to 10 years later I've tried SimCity4 in earnest.  It is frustrating.  Since the last time I played a Sim City game, I had spent dozens of hours in ancient city-builder games like Caesar III, Pharaoh, Zeus Master of Olympus, and Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom.  In those games, I am used to zoning housing, and building everything that is needed.  I'm not sure if it has always been this way with Sim City, but a sizeable portion of the gameplay involves doing nothing but zoning.  I made the early mistake of thinking my people deserved good things like good hospitals, schools, technology, and such, only to discover I was crashing in debt quickly, and the people didn't seem to care.  So to keep a stable city going, all you really need to do is zone.  Zone residential for 80% of the map, zone commercial nearby, zone industrial far away, but not that far.  Wait.  Zone some more.  Wait.  Zone.  Wait.  Wait.  Build some necessities (police, fire, hospital, education, utilities).  Wait.  A full 50% of the game is just zoning and waiting for the zoned areas to develop.  The other 50% is staring at the budget and engaging in a constant battle to balance the budget, to maintain more income than expenditures.  Just like in real life, people are ungrateful little pigs who whine and complain about the slightest of tax increases to prevent your utilities from collapsing due to debt, then whine and complain because the water budget has been cut and now the pipes aren't as strong.  Maybe it's too realistic for me or I'm just not used to it, but I found myself becoming infuriated with my people.  Not because they complain about tax rates, but because they seem to not be doing anything to help me help them.  EVERY TIME I zone commercial areas and they build up, the businesses have Crime: Low, Pollution: Low,  Customers: Low.  No matter what, no matter how large the population, no matter how many roads (not streets) connect them, ALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES HAVE LOW CUSTOMERS.  No one seems to be doing anything to help these businesses, and they stagnate, never generating more tax income over years.  After enough years, the businesses go out of business and the buildings are abandoned.  Similarly, if I cut the water budget and some houses lose water for more than a month, the buildings are abandoned.  Another big problem involves neighboring cities; the only ones you can interact with are the ones directly beside you in either directions.  You can't have business deals with a city two blocks away, or across the river, which is utterly ridiculous.  Landmarks seem to provide nothing at all; things like the Living Mall don't work as malls, and they produce zero income, and zero bonuses to tourism.  The Rush Hour expansion adds some fun features, like being able to drive vehicles directly in your city, and suffer the horrifyingly bad road and highway network you've set up first-hand.  You can do missions that actually affect the city-building aspect (such as foiling enough crimes to have the city support a Deluxe Police Station, or help a group of scientists so they establish a disease research center).  Despite the amount of problems I have with this game, I always end up coming back, wanting to try and explore more, only to be reduced back to the monotonous schedule of waiting, zoning, waiting, and waiting more.  The budget is so damn fickle that I hesitate just to build anything other than Zoning because it will add more maintenance costs that the tax rates never manage to cover.  Also the biggest problem with Windows 7:  The game randomly closes.  Doesn't matter what you do, where you are, what you're playing, the game will abruptly stutter for half a second, then apparently crash, or close down.  No error message, no freezing, no white tint and ""SimCity4 has encountered an error"" with the loading screen to submit problem to Microsoft.  It just closes as if you'd hit Alt + F4.

When people initially play this game, they will likely be awestruck by its beautiful hand-drawn artwork, its traditional RPG mechanics, incredible humor, and fascinating story; but then it seems the further you get in the game, the more the game frustrates you.  Contrary to others have said in the more ""negative"" of the reviews here, I do not think the armor system is that broken. I think the leveling system is broken. Leveling seems to have no affect on your character whatsoever, while armor and weapons make a much bigger influence. Unfortunately, most of the gear and accessories- especially in chapters 3 and 4- require an unreasonable amount of money to purchase, forcing players to grind to no-end. And without the armor upgrades, a normal equal-level mob can take 50% of your health away with one hit (assuming they don't crit, because then they can attack again up to 3x, basically killing you).  Another big problem with this game is its dungeon design. The first few chapters had a great set-up, they were simple but not too simple. In the later parts of the game, the dungeons all become these giant mazes where every single new room and floor looks exactly like the previous. To make matters worse, while trying to traverse through these labyrinths, you still have to solve puzzles on top of it and look for treasures. The worst feeling is when you finally find the exit, but then questions yourself whether or not you found all of the great items in the dungeon (especially considering how expensive gear is, as previously mentioned), making you save and turn back around into the maze, praying that you can find your way back to the exit again.  The skill system is also broken. In order to upgrade your skill from level 1 to 5, you need a series of medallions (bronze, silver, gold, platinum). If you have 100 silvers, 100 gold, and 100 platinum but no bronze, then your skill will never get higher than level 1. Unfortunately, bronze medallions are extremely difficult to acquire and once you get to the mid-point of the game, you can't go back to try to grind up some.  In total, you have over 100 different skills and I only acquired 10 medallions throughout the entire game, most I used prematurely since I just assumed you'll be given the opportunity to get more later. I assumed wrong.  The last big issue I have with this game is the final dungeon, boss, and ending. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it sucked. It's short and lacks the needed substance to give you that closure and reward for all the hard work you put into game. [Minor spoilers]: The final set of boss fights are just as awful. For one, characters that you've been leveling this entire game will be suddenly omitted from those fights. One character in particular, receives his final weapon just a few floors from the bosses and then he's ejected from the final two fights completely. What's the point, then? Also, you're only allowed to use 3 instead of the usual 4 characters for these fights, and all three characters are characters you don't get to choose. One of the forced characters in particular is just awful too.  Lastly, the final boss doesn't matter...literally. If you beat him, you get the ending. If you wipeout, you get the same ending. There was no point in even fighting him.  All-in-all, this game had so much potential and I really did love it initially, but then as it progressed, it just got worse and worse to the point where it actually kind of makes you angry.

So when I heard they were coming out with a sequel, I initially had little interest because frankly, I thought it would just be a rehash.  Well, to a certain degree it is the same thing but this time around, the game is so much better.  The storyline is a huge improvement (actually the fact that there IS a storyline is a huge improvement) and you really love to hate Handsome Jack. There is much more humor and the developers really improved nearly every aspect of the game.  The menu and map system are a huge improvement and the powers are better than the first game.  I also like the ability to rank up with points you earn by completing challenges.  To be fair, the game can still be repetitive at times and the loot you find early on is sort of pathetic.  The items for sale in the vending machines are typically pretty lame/low level which sadly, goes on through the entire game - I mostly just purchased ammo because the found items are way better.  Once you get leveled up a bit though, the game improves quickly.  The things you liked about the first game are still there - open world, varied missions, loot, tons of guns, etc but just better in nearly every way.

In this game you play Samuel Gordon - a british nobleman who is obsessed with proving that his grandfather's death was not accidental or suicide, but was in fact a murder.  In order to do this, he returns to the family manor to snoop around & see what he can find out.  However, during his stay, several more murders occur that he knows in his gut must be connected, but how?  Could it be the centuries-old family curse?  In order to find out, you get to explore many, many different locations, including: 2 different manors, a church, a small village, the coroners home, a place similar to Stonehenge, an insame asylum, and quite a few underground tunnels & passages.  There are several things I loved about this game:  the graphics are awesome, there are so many places to explore, most of the things you need to do make sense, it's a pretty long game when compared to other mystery games out there, and the ending is quite shocking.  However, there are also a few downfalls as well, including: the language appears to have been translated into English, and many of the phrases/use of language just don't seem to fit (this happens especially in the beginning); many of the items you are guided to click on aren't necessary; it uses different controls than most games, so you have to get used to what buttons to click when; and several times during the game Samuel can die, and if this happens, you don't get the option to ""try again"" - you have to load your game & begin again from the last time you saved it.  SO BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A TRAP IS JUST WAITING IN YOUR MIDST...  Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing mystery games.  It's fun and, considering its length, it's well worth the money.

I've found that holding those buttons down for long periods of time (like sprinting and playing face-up D in hoops games) causes hand cramps due to the longer range of motion on these 2 buttons in comparison to the PS2 dual-shock controller.  I don't like that you can't change the button mapping to be more like the previous games.  In all of the button map options in 2K7, R2 is the sprint button.  That annoyed me.  - Sixaxis free throws.  This felt like a gimmick to make use of the motion sensing capabilities of the PS3 controller.  Luckily you can change it back to use the analog stick for freethrows.  - I don't care for the right analog 'Shot stick'.  I'd prefer to use this for advanced dribbling moves (cross-over, spin move, etc).  I find the freestyle dribbling system in the 2K basketball games difficult to use.  I have a hard time of getting it to do what I want.  I didn't play a lot of the other game modes, and didn't have enough time to play much into a franchise.  All said, this is a great hoops game.  I won't buy it, only because I'll likely buy the College Hoops 2K7 game when it's available.

Yes, the first few rounds feel like every other Civilzation title in the series. But once you get to the middle rounds, the addition of Religion and Great People definitely add a new component to the game. And the audio and graphics are amazing, which I think I forgot to mention below. Once you download the patch, the zoom function rocks. When you go to the most zoomed out level and scroll, the world revolves like a globe. Really cool. Here was my original review:  Yes the discs are mislabled, and yes some of the zoom features don't work, but other than that everything else runs fine for me, although I should add I haven't gotten to the end yet. But, technical issues notwithstanding, my main complaint with the game is that nothing major has changed. Oh, sure there are new religions and units and the micromanagement is lessened, but the gameplay still feels very similar. In the beginning you move around a few pieces exploring the map. You build a few new cities which eventually become unhappy for reasons you can barely control and you bump into other civs that all have better technology than you. Other than the fancy new graphics, I feel like I'm still playing Civ III, which felt an awful lot like Civ II.

You will be playing the same strike missions over and over with slightly higher level enemies and Crucible is just a unbalanced mess were level does matter.  They stated in the interview that level advantages won't exist in crucible so that a level 15 player can compete with a level 25 but that was a total lie. I am currently at level 22 and when i face anyone below 20 they are just no match and this is because the weapons you pick up at over 20 have much better specs. Ya they lowered the damage points but what about all the other aspects of the gun? Nope still the same. Also you are not guaranteed a match item for coming first in a match, I actually discovered that if you sit down during a match and just let other players beat the snot out of you, you have the same chance at getting a match item as the person who came in first. So why try?  The environments are pretty small and the edge is not clearly defined which has led to many deaths during gameplay. Exploring is boring since it usually doesn't pay off.  Like i mention before I am currently at level 22 which is greater than the level cap at 20 which means my level is based on the items I mount. So far only items classified as rare and above will give you ""light"" which is needed to level up and now playing regular missions has become pointless since those missions basically only yield uncommon and below items.  This game was such a let down that I decided to pick up Battlefield 4 and just play this when ever i want to play Halo (which was 100x's better).  I will say this though, it is still early in this games life and events are scheduled to happen so I might change my review but as of right now I don't recommend this game.  Update 10/10/14 I have basically stopped playing because of how unbalanced gameplay is. I re-made a new character using a hunter and was amazed at how dominant this class is in crucible (which is basically the only game mode that isn't boring) and decided that this game was crap and not worth playing.

616,53847,5,False,"07 23, 2007",A2KRFFATNM0GOU,B0001I9YGC,Big Boss Games,"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: L.E.G.  As a lover and avid player of FPS (First Person Shooter) type games, I am probably one of the toughest critics and a game must satisfy all my criteria for me to give it a 5/5 rating. Without any doubts, Call of Duty Finest Hour has successfully accomplished this lofty goal.  To start with, Call of Duty Finest Hour is entirely based on events that happened during World War II. But, ActiVision took on a bigger role than just making a video game and actually tries and succeeds in teaching us a brief history lesson. Granted it's very short and concise, but it helps to setup the game and it's many diverse and challenging levels.  You start out playing as a member of the Russian Army fighting with your comrades on the Eastern Front, from the Volga to Stalingrad. The missions can be somewhat difficult to finish, but the squad leader does give you instructions (just as if you were in the army) on what you need to do or where you need to go. ""Blow up that building"" and ""Take out those machine guns"" are typical fare. And most of the time you are a member of a ""squad"", so don't try to be all ""Rambo"" and try to defeat the Germans all by yourself. You will get slaughtered!  After you complete your mission(s) as one person, you are then placed in someone else's shoes and get to fight the war from their perspective. Which also opens you up to using different weapons and driving around in tanks. But, this is not Grand Theft Auto. You can't go around and jump in vehicles and take off. Your tour of duty on the Eastern Front with the Russians takes a total of 8 sometimes-grueling missions. At least the game is very forgiving and lets you restart the mission at the last checkpoint.  After the Eastern Front, you are whisked off to North Africa to serve with the British Army in Tunisia. All of the buildings and backgrounds used in this game are simply amazing. There is a lot of rich and articulate detail to keep your attention. You will serve a total of 4 missions with the bulldogs. More neat weapons used by the Brits and a lot of blowing stuff up in these levels. G-D Save the Queen!  And last, but not least, you go to the Western Front to fight with the American Army. As in previous levels, you get more awesome weapons to shoot and tanks to drive. Some of the toughest battles will be fought with the Americans. A total of 7 missions await your shooting skills.  Call of Duty Finest Hour by ActiVision is available for the Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube. It is rated ""T"" for Teen and contains a ton of blood and a whole lot of violence. Since this game is based on World War II, blood and violence is to be expected. Total missions are 19 and 23 different weapons.  This game is Single Player only, but does offer multiplayer online broadband only and 2-16 players. Online gametypes are: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Search & Destroy. Overall, this game was as close to perfect as they can get with very few technical glitches. Like one time I was crawling around on the floor and trying to climb a flight of stairs and my character just fell through some empty space to his terrible death.  This game was just so well balanced between missions, story, music and action that I had to give it a 5/5.

Along with coverage in ""health"" segments on National News and cable. Has really paid off for the company. The sells for the release were astounding. On par in personal experience with two major franchise (SSB:B, MKW) release nights. Which is quite a feat' for a new ""Wii"" titled experience. How the title fares in the long run has yet to be seen. Yet I'm pretty sure once word of mouth gets out the game will continue to have successful sales.  As everyone knows by now, Wii Fit includes the Balance Board. Which works as a 3-Dimensional scale to measure your Body Mass Index (BMI) and Center Of Balance (COB). The board also has a digital persona built into Wii Fit that introduces itself from your initial way in. Offering suggestions on how to reach your set personal goals. As for the actual board the quality is of Nintendo standard. It can hold up to 330lbs/150kg, and has surprising accuracy.  The Wii Fit software is rather versatile, with an expansive selection of up to 40 games/exercises. Split into four categories(Yoga, Strength, Aerobics, and Balance) each focused on certain points of ""Body Training"" for a healthier life. I know the premise may sound a bit bland. Leaving most wondering if this game is nothing more than a gimmick to make ""working out"" appear to be fun. But I can't stress enough how much fun it really is. Despite being nothing more than a digital personal trainer. An if you have been thinking of beginning a daily work out regime yet haven't wanted the bother. This title does justice to relieving that bother and entertaining you all the while you really feel the burn. If one was to set bi-weekly goals for themselves and really stick to a daily routine of Wii Fit. It certainly would be no problem to achieve results. From only two days with the product and I can already tell a difference in my physical performances.  My starting desired results is to gain 5lbs, so I'm certainly going to give Wii Fit my own personal test over the next few weeks. I plan to post the results once this set period is over. I'm feeling rather confident about that goal at the moment. Check back here in two weeks to find out how that all goes. My Mother has also joined in on the ""healthy"" fun and began her own goal to lose weight. Then once my sister and nephew seen us enjoying it they had to get in on the fun as well. So if you and or anyone else in your family have been wanting to get into shape but lack motivation. Wii Fit is just what you need.

Soon after, I discovered that you only have ""three days"" to complete the game. It's probably closer to three hours. This oddity is soon solved though, allowing you to save and refresh throughout milestones in the game. It is challenging though, completing some of the dungeons in this amount of time. You can't dawdle through them like you can in the other games. I actually ran out of time a during a couple points in the game, making it frustrating to have to play through everything again. Majora's Mask is a game that I put down and came back to many times. It's not nearly as accesible as a lot of the other Zelda games in terms of gameplay, but it still has a lot to offer.  This game is very original, even for a Zelda game. There are a number of intriguing side quests, characters, and worlds, and another cool aspect of it is that you get to acquire and wear many different masks that give you new abilities such as swimming and rolling about 50 miles an hour. Majora's Mask is not as good as Ocarina of Time, but how could it be? It came directly after. It's a solid, and worthwhile sequel, it just takes some getting used to. For one thing, there's only four dungeons, but they are all much harder than a lot of the dungeons in Ocarina of Time. Two of them are probably two of the hardest dungeons in the whole franchise. I only really liked one of them.  If you were a fan of the musical aspects of Ocarina of Time, the fact that this game continues that trend is a definite plus, especially considering it adds new instruments. This is one of a few ways that Majora's Mask is more diverse than its predecessor, another other being that you can play as multiple characters in this game.  Although I have not and probably never would play through all of it again, it's still a dark, atmospheric, and unforgettable game. I really like how this game incorporates apocalyptic aspects too, as they give the story a sense of urgency and dread, something pretty much all other Zelda games are not as good about doing.  The story is also much better and more interesting than those of the other Zelda games that diverged from the main Hyrule setting and structure. I recommend this game to anyone who has played and enjoyed Zelda games before. It's a bit experimental, and it's not one of the very best, but I would still rank it higher than most of the others, as it's actually one of the deepest, most immersing Zelda games I have ever played.",Very good game,1372032000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,give directly play much amount character consider world like come love ever dawdle ocarina recommend hour way apocalyptic could four actually others time can't wear trend aspect get mask solve point dark franchise instrument many thing diverse anyone experimental harder something solid make multiple different musical atmospheric structure swim good although interesting hard put nearly really quest one fact play offer like predecessor lot new term challenge back discover rank original dread complete ability whole incorporates intrigue sense frustrate soon deepest good setting strange surreal use probably rolling day couple zelda first oddity hour bit continue number game higher immerse refresh cool add time especially acquire would mile everything majora's game fan also still complete mask sequel even closer diverged aspect urgency side main plus never definite begin enjoyed hyrule best two story run gameplay though take throughout accesible there's milestone worthwhile dungeon allow get three compel save another unforgettable pretty

There's a system of elastic straps inside the case to hold the 3DS in place, but these are more of a nuisance than a feature as you have to awkwardly maneuver and slide the 3DS under the straps to get it in and out. I would not trust this case to protect my 3DS from a drop at any height.  My current 3DS XL ""case"" solution is the dreamGEAR Comfort Grip. It's a soft silicone grip that encases the entire system.

647,181262,4,True,"01 30, 2010",A1AYBKV6DO2389,B001NTFATI,Don&#039;t Panic,"I would say that I have a mouse fettiche.  My favorite mouse of all time was the Logitech Wingman PS-2 gaming mouse.  The ony drawback to that mouse was the lack of a thumb-buitton and scroll wheel, but for it's time it was awesome.  Logitech has not come close to that degree of mousing perfection since...that is until the G9x.  I did not have the G9 so I can not compare them.  The last mouse I had was the G5, and there is no comparison.  First let me start with what is good about the mouse, since there is so very little that is bad.  The Good: Ergonomics - the ergonomics are about as close to perfect as you could imagine.  Just like the Wingman Gaming Mouse, it is more of a wedge shape which just seems to fit the hand perfectly.  Ergonomics are only enhanced by the multiple enclosures which have a very pleasing texture and non-slip grip.  This is a new feature not seen in any mouse before and I think it is now a must-have.  Weight - As with many prior mice, you can fine tune the weight and there is a good selection of weights.  With the heaviest load it has excellent heft.  Cord - Nice, long, thin, braided fabric-wrapped cord does not interefere with mouse tracking.  Buttons - The buttons have a perfect action and solid detents.  The thumb buttons are positioned just right for a standard (non-claw) grip.  The scroll wheel has a very solid feel and smooth action.  Ashetics - Very handsome, selectable light colors are a plus.  Features - Scroll wheel can be changed from click-type to smooth-scrolling.  Selectable tracking speed is very well implemented.  Saveable game profiles with onboard memory is a nice feature if you do LAN parties.  I wouldn't use this, but nice to have anyway.  Tracking - smooth and precise, as you would expect from any modern mouse.  So what is bad?  Well for one thing it broke in the first week I had it.  I know things break, and I would not dock a star for that alone but this is an auspicious start for an otherwise outstanding mouse.  More importantly is that I think they left some important features out.  With your hand resting on the mouse, your 4th and 5th fingers just hang off the side...doing nothing.  Why not have a third button toward the right side to increase functionality?  If I were designing my perfect mouse, that feature would be there.  The front thumb button is difficult to reach without a claw grip.  I like the design of the Microsoft thumb buttons on their gaming mice better - with a vertical rather than horizintal orientation.  When are input device makers going to realize that it is easier to rotate the thumb rather than bend it?  The feet are not very slippery.  I replaced them with Hyperglide feet (from FrozenCPU).  Other than that I have to say that this thing is pretty close to perfect.  Hard to not recommend it for any PC gamer.  Even my wife loves the way it feels and she doesn't game at all.

Easily one of the better wireless controllers on the market. I almost forgot to mention: The triggers here are digital, and not analog. I've grown absolutely frustrated with analog triggers due to their uselessness outside of racing games.

677,69649,5,False,"03 18, 2006",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0009WPZMW,Lisa Shea,"Most racing games have you trying to dodge crashes and hitting your opponents. In Burnout Revenge, your entire goal is to create as much mayhem as possible.  We have every racing game for the XBox 360 and really love this genre. I have to admit that the first few times playing Burnout Revenge that I found it VERY hard to ""hit"" the cars. I would naturally dodge them. Even when I said to myself ""hit them! hit them!"" my fingers would zoom around them. I finally broke that habit and was able to mash them with great glee.  The graphics are really quite amazing. The car model is great of course - they have really gotten that down on the XBox 360. But more than that - your car deforms in a TON of ways. The paint scrapes off. The sides dent in. It all has to do with how you damage yourself. Cars get sheared in half, tires fly off, you name it.  There are a number of game types. There are races where you bash as you go. There are crash situations where you launch yourself into traffic and see how much destruction you can make. Other cars on the highway are fair game; bash them and watch them fly. Boost yourself to faster speeds. You develop relationships with other drivers - there will be certain cars that are out for revenge. There are grand prix matches of multi races.  Each course has its own distinct feel. These aren't closed tracks - you are driving through the streets of LA, Miami, Tokyo and other areas. You get palm trees and shiny office buildings, all depending on the area you're in. There are helicopters flying overhead and a ton of car models.  The music is reaosnably good, a collection of fast-paced modern music. I would have loved it if you could choose from different music styles as well, but you can't have everything.  There's a ton of replay value here - you go back to get the top ranking in every course, aiming for those perfect scores. Since you unlock some really cool cars as you go, it can really help out to take one of the later, super cars back to the early tracks.  The LIVE feature is really neat, too. Not only can you bash other players online, but you can even record your favorite crashes and load them up. It might be voted one of the top 20 best!  If I had any complaints about this game, it would be the ""look back"" the game does every time you slay an enemy. Since your car is still moving very quickly, it's sometimes really tough, if you're about to hit a wall or something, to have that look away and look back happen. Also, I don't like the camera angle in general. It is very low and right against the car. I like an angle that is higher up and further back. I realize some players like both of these features as is, so I wish they would have options for a player to change these 2 items.  Still, those are minor complaints in a game that is a ton of fun.

697,397057,1,False,"11 25, 2015",AU3I76F66N9G2,B00W8FYFBA,D. Karkason,"It s not a bad game  but seriously 60$ for a game that lacks of content isn't worth it. If you really want this game wait until DLCs come out and you have a deal on them with the game or wait until black friday and see if the price drop to 10$  Gameplay - really simplistic although  in all honest for casual player holding 1 weapon isn't really the best. Neither CoD and Battlefield holds only 1 weapon. You probably saw a sniper as a side weapon guess what you can only fire it once than wait until it recharges. The star cards used in the game is new and fresh but the issue is that they should have at least responded real time vehicle in  each camp. Seriously this is a huge let down to pick up star cards in different places. A good example is flying any  aircraft such as the star fighter. You can t land or take off you just start off in the air. DICE could have at least added a sequence of the jets coming out of an hangar or a huge ship to make it more realistic but nope the plane comes out of nowhere. Shooting doesn't use reloading at all. I mean i have no issues with this kind of mechanic but they could have mix both and lastly you can't get the jet pack until you re ranked 15 ( ranking system is really boring it looks like leveling your digimon or pokemon). Yes you heard it. They could have done something really cool with the ranking with different ranking names.  Lastly, aside that you have to be at the appropriate level in order to earn certain features for playing you have to also buy them as well.  Casual gamers don't need that. This doesn't exist in CoD not saying they should have gone that route but that s no casual players aspects. There are so many things missing in the game modes as well. Also the most frustrating is that you are limited on where you go in the map you re playing in walker assault.  Even though i was within the map i didn t know you couldn t go as far as you want further until i saw a timer saying i should be in combat??????? and after 10 sec you d die if you don't  stay in the zone of assault. I mean what if you wanted to be more strategic or go run to your enemy camp. Lastly flying the star fighters or any other jets is horrible. You are as well limit in the flying mechanics. They might have wanted to make it easier but they eventually made it harder for dumb reasons.  Graphics: They are beautiful and the sound is amazing but the lack of content is  not  worth 60$  Game modes: Ok this is where it starts to really suck. The game modes that are at least interesting is Walker assault and supremacy. Yes i know there is hero hunt and hero vs villains but look those game mode are more like side game modes that have no relevance to the game at all. In fact when they hype the game so much they used only walker assault nothing else if you saw this.  No space battles (this would have been  included in one of the best game modes) which is really lame. In battlefront 2 you had space battles and more interesting game modes than this one although i was not a huge fan of the graphics but again that was on ps2. DICE is a scam to release more content forcing the player to pay for more because the game is half finished as most  said it. DICE should make those contents coming out for free at least the first two and implement space battles. I do understand that DICE may not have had the time or was probably time pressure to release this game but seriously when i saw articles of DICE saying they didn't want to include space battles  because they wanted everyone to be in once place baffled me.  DLCs are great when the game has already full of content here there practically to none.  ALSO WARNING: there are no campaigns like the previous battlefront and there are no single player modes aside the mission ( which i didn't do) No split screen for online playing at all as well which is a downside. Before buying you have to know that you need three things PS4 or XBOX one/ internet connection and MONEY!!! Yes you re going to pay for the PS plus in order to use the online game of battlefront which does make you 12 or 13$ for three months plus 60$ for a half finished game + DLCs that you need to have a complete game and that will take forever to come out.  They have the selfishness to ask you to pay another 50$ for a season pass. I would say don't do it! wait until the DLC comes out because they can also suck as well and that s 50$ in the trash. You also don t own the game unfortunately because you are on a dedicated server that s going to one day be turned off. If this game actually shut down in a few months because of it s negative reviews. They should expect to refund everyone who bought the game and can't play it.  Maps: 3 maps on walker assault and supremacy ( the rest are just variants of these 3 maps nothing new there) i haven t seen  a different environment aside the ones of the walker assault and supremacy. For example if you play hero vs villain you can see that the maps are just smaller version of the 3 maps of walker assaults. They said they had 13 maps but look these maps are just tinier but the same environment. Aside of that they are beautiful and well structured and make you feel like star wars but still. Not too many maps. DICE  could have done a better job on content.  Aside of sound and good graphic this game is nothing.

I found most of the puzzles solvable in under a minute without using any hints, though a few of them gave me trouble. The main story mode has 138 puzzles, along with 3 Extras puzzle sections that I've unlocked thus far (there may be a couple more). Another bonus to this game is the downloadable weekly puzzle. If you have Wifi, and you've configured your DS to connect to it, you can download a new puzzle every week to your game. There is also a special extra for those who have played the first game (Curious Village), though I've yet to check out what it is.  In general, if you carefully read the descriptions, you can solve most of the puzzles. There are a few that you simply must play until you get them right (the Peg Solitaire puzzles, the Sliding Block puzzles, and the Knight's Tour puzzles), and the hints for these aren't worth buying - they won't help you. There is one puzzle that I never figured out how to solve (I simply used the hints - they give the answer away if you read all 3), and that puzzle is called ""Boy's Club"". Even the answer to it made no sence. I tried doing the puzzle just the way the answer said, and instead of eliminating all the girls, I eliminated about half the guys. If that puzzle has a correct answer that actually works, I haven't been able to find it. Thankfully that was the only puzzle that seemed unsolveable out of the 134 main story mode puzzles I've played. (Though a few of the hidden changes pictures require a very sharp eye. If all else fails, start counting things: railing bars, garlic on strands, etc. Some of the differences are almost microscopic.)  In short, if you like puzzle games, this is a good game to try. It doesn't require any math higher than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve, and the vast majority of the puzzles simply test your critical thinking. The story is engaging and interesting. The music really sets each scene, and the artwork and cutscenes are very nicely done. I can't wait fr Professor Layton 3!

704,452462,3,False,"03 13, 2016",A3SD57HI8TYFFZ,B00005B70U,K. Stuart,"Adventures of Cookie and Cream is a split screen, timed, race to the finish game in which two characters help each other to progress down two parallel lanes of the same course. Each lane has different race elements but switches, levers, buttons, and various other objects in one lane can activate or move objects in the other. Quite often you'll need to raise a bridge, open a door, or activate a machine for your partner. Map objects move freely back and forth between lanes, such as a train in one level that each character will need to ride when the train is on their side. A small number of levels bring the duo together and give them joint control over a vehicle in which each player controls half of the steering abilities. Players will be solving puzzles constantly, but platforming is also a huge aspect of this game. Throughout the course of the game, players will progress through 8 worlds (9 with the Bonus world), each of which contains 4 levels and a boss battle. Each world has its own unique theme that helps to add some variety to the levels.  Allow me upfront to say this game is frustratingly difficult anytime players need to work together in performing precise movements. Every mistake costs 20 seconds off the clock, further complicating completion. The levels that have vehicles are particularly challenging, especially the canoe level. Controls just aren't precise enough to do exactly what you want. We knew what we wanted to do but had a hard time actually paddling the canoe in the right direction. A different level had us driving a car and the game switched the dual controls on us, so it took a few tries to figure out how to steer the car.  With few exceptions, all puzzles were at a level of difficulty that was challenging but doable given the time limits for each level. The exceptions are the Bonus levels, a level in which you have to play a tune on a piano, and the final level and boss in the game. The final level and boss fight require perfect plays in order to complete, and even with a perfect play you're still crunched for time. The other boss fights were pretty easy once you figured out what to do, but that could be quite challenging. We had to look up walkthroughs for two of the bosses.  Every level has hints throughout, so players with no puzzle-solving abilities could probably solve the puzzles with hints. Sadly, though, there were not any hints when we actually needed them (the two boss fights).  Typical interaction between players didn't require too much coordination early on, and it increases to a still manageable level later, so you're able to play your own lane without leaning too heavily on your partner. In the parts where coordination was required and you needed to wait for your partner, the game punished you for standing still, which is entirely uncalled for. A bird of some kind would come down and land on your head if you stood still for a few seconds, stealing your time at twice the normal speed.  Overall the game is fun, albeit a bit short. I highly discourage anyone from playing this game solo as the controls would just be far too complicated in the later levels. Adventures of Cookie & Cream certainly isn't for everyone, and I'd go as far to say people who like puzzle platformers may not even enjoy this game. If you struggle working with a partner and talking through your actions, then you will surely fail at this game. If, however, you can work well with a partner and want to play a really unique game, then definitely give this one a shot.",A game you could play solo... if you were crazy.,1457827200,,,,player give mistake puzzle tune hard move highly discourage much cost lane door switch quite head work dual character action shoot raise world enjoy canoe drive theme exception order stand like fail however boss level piano player parallel could add puzzle need character half figure come actually world perfect ride open complicate clock normal everyone paddle aspect allow enough wait punish anyone button certainly i'd definitely cream element joint puzzle-solving unique different later upfront want direction train solve contains lean albeit huge play fun finish really hint course one play crunch fight entirely completion need back challenge control activate perform ability right try bonus would increase help far able kind vehicle speed twice take probably anytime together complicate talk machine adventure bite platformers number want solve lever variety early help screen time interaction frustratingly limit especially difficulty manageable split various particularly part level bos bird movement stand game also vehicle still complete figure even battle time forth easy uncalled solo heavily difficult second walkthroughs side bridge object require bring short switch play steer constantly car steal sadly duo overall two often map require work race progress without steer look though typical lane throughout fight struggle platforming people partner precise freely knew cookie go well say exactly doable final coordination every land may surely give small pretty control

They both use the same scroll wheel and mouse shape, and the G400s even has the same non-braided cable as the G400. However the feel of the mouse itself is different.  The G400s implements both a smooth semi-gloss feel to the top, and a imitation rubber texture to the sides. The surface of the top is designed to keep your hand from sticking to it, even if your hand starts to get a bit warm or clammy. They call this their Hydrophobic coating. While the mouse works great for all grip types, (claw, finger-tip grip, etc) I find this feature especially nice since I have a palm grip when gaming. I'm able to adjust my grip easily, without my hand adhering to the surface at all. The rubber texture feel of the sides is nice, and as of yet I've had no problems with it peeling or wearing through.  This is a corded mouse, which tends to be what most gamers prefer. The cord is very long, and easily threads from my keyboard tray through the back of my desk and into the back of my tower, with plenty of cable to spare. It's not braided for reinforcement  like many other gaming mice are, but the cord is fairly stiff, so it does seem to be tangle free.  There are 8 programmable buttons on the mouse, including the two forward and back buttons on the side, left, right and middle click buttons and the DPI increase, decrease and default buttons on the top. With the included Logitech software, you can program each button how you would like it. All the buttons and the scroll wheel have a good response to them. They're not overly sensitive so that you're accidentally clicking just from the wight of your finger, but it also doesn't take too much pressure to click the either. I haven't had any problems with any of the buttons sticking or double clicking.  Also, prediction is turned OFF for this mouse. There is no on/off option. It's designed with it off, which most people seem to prefer anyway.  The shape and feel of this mouse is very Logitech, and it's built to last for years. Not a heavy mouse, but feels like quality.

Well, as a HUGE San Andreas fan and an owner of most Rockstar games out there (except for Manhunt), I'm here to tell you that Grand Theft Auto IV is about 90% overrated hype and about 10% gameplay. No, GTAIV isn't outright bad or anything. It's just not what it used to be. Mostly, I mean, fun. At face value, this is Grand Theft Auto on the new gen systems. But besides that, it's a more-realistic, but less fun GTA.  I guess, that's the biggest problem with GTA IV. Set in an alternate universe New York City, Rockstar strives to make GTA about as real as an experience as it can be, but in reality, it's not. Really, what it is, is a better looking version of GTA with a bunch of new ""more realistic"" features. I'll start with the positives, first. GTA looks very, very good. Not even close to Photo-realistic, but good. The graphics and lighting and weather effects are good enough to warrant being on the 360 or PS3. Now, while I was expecting ""Gran Turismo"" style realism here, that's not what I got, but still, the game looks nice. But now, for everything else.  There are many ""improvements"" to the game that supposedly enhances the experience, but they really only suck the fun out of the game as I mentioned earlier. Just about everything is ""enhanced"" to have the realism effect, but it only makes the game frustrating. Breaking into cars is a pain and now takes almost as much time as it would in real-life. You have to break open the window, unlock the door, climb inside, and hotwire the car from the inside to get it going. While I was surprised to find this task quicker than I expected, it still hurts you in desperate situations when you need a car right away, which are in many missions. I hated the ""system"" so much, I never bothered to steal a parked car more than once in this game. The system is actually more of a theft deterent than anything!  Next, we come to the driving. Good God, the driving is probably the most *frustrating* thing EVER! Acceleration is simple enough, especially on the 360 controller. But just about everything else is horrible! Driving in this game, I can say honestly, is MUCH harder than actually driving in real life. The brakes are crazy and I don't know just how long it takes the average player to get used to driving, but I'm still struggling not to crash into people and walls and stuff! I have to drive like an old lady just to avoid bumping into the police cars which are quite literally on every other block in the game.  And when you DO get in trouble... oh man! GTA IV has a slight improvement on the old system in which you can now evade the police by simply outrunning them, even if you are beyond one star. In the old games, you could outrun the police with one star, but not with anything higher. In GTA IV, you have a circumference area that the cops chase you in. Drive out of their circumference, and you escape them. But it sounds simpler than it is. The more wanted levels you get, the larger the area the cops chase you in. And with simply two stars, the ""area of pursuit"" becomes hard to get out of. By a full-on six, the circumference is literally the size of an entire Liberty City borough! I found this out when I tried to sneak into Algonquin (Manhattan). They have Pay N' Sprays still, but they're virtually useless now. The time you'll need them most, you won't be able to use them cause if the cops see you enter one, it's effect becomes null and void. And over two stars will have police swarming on you. And make no mistake, Liberty City's finest are three times as vicious as those San Andreas donut-munchers. The police are vicious on you, and their A.I. is quite enhanced and far more intelligent than before. Heck, a cop will shoot you even if you're unarmed and only have one star! To make matters worse, your car no longer provides you with adequate protection. Cops and other enemies can shoot you THROUGH your windshield! Before, your car just got damaged some. Now, you can quite easily die even in your car, and there's no real way to duck for cover inside, either. This is what I mean when I say the fun is sucked out of the game in favor for ""realism.""  The controls of the game are often needlessly complicated, even with all things not involving cars. Doing a simple thing like running while trying to keep the camera fixed on you involve all your available fingers. The shooting is supposedly ""improved"" but it's not. I actually never found issue with GTA: San Andreas' shooting and targeting system, but many people did. Either way, the auto-targeting in GTA IV is flawed, at best, and as you'd expect, the targeting itself has no idea who you actually want to target. It's more like you targeting whoever *IT* makes you target! Yeah, it's a problem. What's worse is how much stronger the enemies are now. It takes a minimum of six shots with a pistol to take down ONE guy! And it's not like you get a lot of ammo with that pistol! You can't afford to waste a single bullet. What's worse is, limb-specific damage seems to be gone, entirely. Whether you aim center mass, or go for the head execution style, it'll still take the same number of bullets to take down a guy. Well, doesn't that just suck?  Now, some more things about the game. The story, itself, is pretty subjective. You'll either get into it, or like me, become quickly bored with it. It's like the same old GTA-style story missions, only it's more ""Been there, done that"", which is disapointing considering the use of the foreigner Niko Bellic opened up a lot of storyline possibilites. But about your first hour into the game, you'll already be playing guard dog to a bunch of people you just met. Your cousin, Roman, is a pain in the butt, but everyone else is even worse. Why do I have to take orders from all these people I barely know? I expected more out of GTA IV, but this is the same old crap, man. What's worse is, the main story seriously ruins all of the ""free roaming"" fun you used to have in GTA! Because of your new, stupid cell phone (with the questionable gray background and black text color scheme which makes it hard enough just to read messages) you'll constantly be getting calls from people and will have to drop everything to help out in vital missions that are important to the story. You'd think a guy with no real job would have more free time. The only real side quest you'll get to have in the beginning is dating the cute and lonely Michelle. If only nice-looking women were this desperate and easy to please in real life. The dates have been upgraded a little bit, giving you the control in what to do, which includes fine dining, playing games like bowling and pool, the arts & theater, going drinking, and other activities. Sadly, the dates are pretty boring and have a ""what's the point?"" feel to them. As much as I like Michelle, even ""Warm Coffee"" isn't worth driving all around Broker all day long boring myself to death.  The size of Liberty City is about maybe half or one-third the size of San Andreas. But considering Liberty is all city, it's pretty impressive. Like I said, you'll often be so busy helping random people, you won't have to much time to explore around (without purposely avoiding missions because you know you aren't going to save anything.) You start off in crappy Broker (Brooklyn) and will have to earn your way to Algonquin and the rest of Liberty City, just like before. That sucks though, because I expected this time to be different, and I wanted to explore everything right away. Rockstar before had said they were taking out all bikes and air vehicles from the game, but I guess, have changed their mind since then. There are a few number of bikes, one speedboat, and the rare, single helicopter in GTA IV. There are also lots of cars in the new Liberty City as well, but quite honestly, most the vehicles have very little relevance in this game and they take a backside to the story. The feeling you had in San Andreas of ""Ooh! I like that car! Lemme go steal that and add it to my collection!"" is gone entirely from this game. Anything you drive is about as equally important/unimportant. Maybe it's because you don't have any garages to put them in? Or any money to afford really modding them, if that's even possible in this game? Or maybe it's because trying to get them is such a pain, even if you manage to avoid the police catching you? At least, they have talking GPS in them, but (and I can't believe I'm defending THIS game, but) I personally like the GPS system in Saint's Row better.  Liberty City now has a huge amount of radio stations (like, 18, I think), but none of the music is on par with the older GTA's. I guess that's because GTA IV takes place in 2008, and it's hard to know what current songs are guaranteed hits in the present. Or maybe it's because music is such crap, nowadays? So, you have a wide variety of music, but no history of what's ""good"" or not helping you out, here. To sum it up, the music just isn't that good, but at least, it's very, very diverse. There's everything ranging from the familiar Hip Hop and Rock stations, to Latino Music and International Funk. And yes, the parody Talk Radio stations are back to, but to be honest, there aren't NEARLY as funny as they were on the West Coast in San Andreas. There's also custom TV and Internet sites in the game, as well, but to be honest, I never quite got around to checking them out. I mean, all that extra crap is great, but it's really just a distraction and it's utterly pointless to have in the game. It's not like it helps you DO anything. And just to bring it up, there's almost NOTHING in all of new Liberty City to remind you that this is a Grand Theft Auto game. All of the GTA staples and landmarks are gone. Well, at least they kept Cluckin' Bell around, but other than that, there's no familiar names or chains or shops from the GTA universe. It's like they all started going bankrupt in the 16 years since San Andreas, and went completely out of business in the seven years since GTA III. It makes the new Liberty City that much more unfamiliar, but then again, I guess some people would call that ""enhancing the experience"" for Niko Bellic, new to Liberty City.  So to recap, GTA IV is a new, more real experience in the GTA world, but that sucks any and all fun and excitement out of the game. No, Rockstar did not reinvent the wheel here, and this is, without a doubt NOT ""Game of the Decade"" or the ""Game of Our Generation."" The little 13-year old boys posting reviews on here need to stop saying that! It's not true! Let's just all call this what it is: GTA on the new consoles. It's no greater or better than simply that. Everything they tried to ""enhance"" for a realer experience just makes the game tedious and tiresome, including your stupid behind cell phone, which I hate! I wish I could just chuck it somewhere! The controls are complicated and confusing, especially for driving. The graphics and interactivity in Liberty City are nice, but not exactly ""on the next level"" of anything. Free roaming is just about dead due to the story constantly keeping you busy, and the missions are old and familiar, but not in a good way. The weapons system is bad with it's targeting, and even fist fighting is a real pain. Fighting was simple and effective in San Andreas. Here, you're looking at three minute fights just to take down one fat slob. I mean, three minutes??? See, that's TOO realistic! The music is so-so at best, and just about everything in the game feels more like a chore than fun. I think because in older GTA's, the storyline wasn't as relevant, leaving you space to do whatever you felt like inbetween, sort of like the weekend from the work week. But now, it's like, everyday is a work day, and I think it's because Rockstar tries to push the story as being SO important and such a driving force in GTA IV. Yeah, I can tell that it was carefully crafted and polished, but it does NOT rank on the level of The Godfather or Scarface. So, no. This isn't an ""interactive movie,"" as some overzealous fans of the game posting reviews will have you believe. The story's okay for a video game, but it's a video game story. It's not exactly good enough to stand on it's own. I really dislike it.  I SO wanted to believe the hype, but I also knew that not having a GTA game in four years would leave a lot of people expecting and wanting more (and believing they got it with this). All GTA IV is, is Grand Theft Auto: Part Four. It's not the Second Coming of video games, or anything rabid fanboys and fangirls will have you believe. Personally, it's not really worth the four year wait or anything, but it's not like it's a horrible game. It's just not that fun, anymore, and the ones who'll play it days on end, will buy it, no matter what anyone tells them. But if you're on the fence, like I was, I would have no problem at all telling you to wait a few months till it drops down in price. It's not THAT spectactular.  Don't believe the hype and don't drink the GTA Kool Aid. If this game REALLY did have a budget of $100 million, than I'm betting $75 million of that went to advertising, feeding the hype machine, and paying off notable gaming sites for unjust Perfect 10 scores. This ISN'T a Perfect Ten game, and I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10, if Amazon had that kind of scale. This is easily the most realistic out of the GTA series, but FAR from the most entertaining, no matter how many fake TV shows and websites arre in the game.

724,250409,5,True,"11 23, 2011",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B0054IN5AA,Christopher Barrett,"I admit that I have not played KOF since the old KOF '95 arcade days.  That's 15 years since!  But I have become disappointed with many other fighting game franchises that I once loved (Street Fighter comes to mind).  Also all the crazy Marvel vs Capcom games don't interest me.  What got my interest here was the slick arcade style control that I saw on the youtube videos.  So I pre-ordered this instead of Elder Scrolls V (pretty crazy huh!), mainly because I wanted the included soundtrack (pre-release bonus).  I haven spent a few hours playing and I will update this review as I play more.  There are several modes to play through: Arcade, Story, VS, Trials, etc... as well as online.  There is quite a bit of depth here.  I played through Arcade a couple of times.  The storyline is nice, pretty fast paced, and interesting in the arcade version.  The last boss(es) are pretty tough and bring to mind some of Soul Calibur's crushing last battles.  If you do get beat up on, then you get to continue with the option of selecting a handicap for your CPU opponent.  I admit the first time I beat the game I had to use the 75% life bar handicap... But I plan on improving quickly!  Story mode is a lot slower and pans out like a partially animated manga.  There are no voice overs, in the arcade mode, characters' mouths move (without voice), but in story, their mouths usually don't.  I enjoy story mode because it gives you much more insight into the characters and the plot.  Essential for someone like me who is new to the series.  Control is slick.  Some of the moves require expert timing and control, but you can get a pretty good grasp of the characters normal and special attacks fairly quickly.  They are often standard fighting game combos.  The EX moves are a little tougher to execute, and chaining them into massive combos requires skill.  Luckily you can go to practice or trial mode to work on them.  In one of the trial modes you select a character and then must hit combos to advance.  It's harder than you think!  Blocking is easy (hold away on the stick), jumping is nice, and running/hopping forward easy to execute.  You also have rolls with the R1 button (standard button configure).  The music is a real treat.  Much is typical J Rock or J Pop, but there are some nice jazzy and bluesy tunes as well.  It's a nice mix, and the tunes are pretty catchy.  They tend to be fast paced during the action and slower during cut scenes.  And I love the voice for ""You Lose""!  It's like he's kind of mocking you, but not in an overly obvious way.  I actually laugh when I lose and hear that voice!  Graphics are a mixed bag. It's a little grainy, even on my Toshiba 46"" 1080p LCD (with HDMI).  It's more noticeable with certain characters, but it doesn't really bother me.  The animation and frame rate are good.  It just looks like a PS2 game ported and enhanced for PS3.  The backgrounds are fun but with the same issue, some grainy qualities, (pixellating?), but again, not complaining.  The characters are all well drawn and pretty interesting to watch on screen.  Special moves are pretty flashy, and finishing an opponent with a special move gives a fun little screen 'blast'.  So overall my first impression is that this is a fun, fast fighting game with a lot of depth, plenty of characters to try out, and lots of combos and moves to work on.  I think that it slightly edges out SSF4 just with the fluid controls and the focus on attack and combos over defense and counters.  People will prefer one style of fighting game over another, but this is one hell of a fighting game that deserves to be played!  It's just FUN!

You ""control"" one character (if you want to call it that) and the other characters fight based on AI. Essentially, it involves you pressing the x button over and over again until the battle is won (unless you want to cast a spell). You can upgrade weapons and armor, as well as skills, and the fairly complex skills element would be really cool if it weren't for the fact that their application in battle is hardly seen because of what's stated above. This game would have been MUCH, MUCH better if more of a turn play based approach was used for the battle system. How boring to sit there and bang on the x button.

First person shooters (FPS) are not my favorite genre but the demo version of Doom3 on the PC gave me such a friggin big scare that I felt compelled to do something about it.  Doom3 for the Xbox is a chilling, thrilling, (add your favorite ..ing here) game where the Mature 17+ rating is simply an understatement.  Be prepared to watch flying corpses, limbs and bones. Expect guttural sounds and demonic whispers next to you in pitch-black tight corridors. No  need to feel paranoid, there ARE actually monsters all around you.  The game is scary at first when you only carry a wuzzy pistol, a flashlight and the shotgun.  Oh, but when you start finding macho weapons such as the plasma gun, rocket launcher, Chaingun, BFG  and the big ass chainsaw, the scared turns to startled, then to upset then to piss*d, and you really want to get even.  Too bad for the easily scared is that you can not turn into a cowboy and start running and screaming Jeronimo! If you don't want to come back to a Quicksave every 5 seconds you must explore every nook and cranny for a piece of protective armor, a few shotgun shells or a devilishly hidden PDA with the necessary codes to open the infirmary or an ammo locker.  You really have no choice here but to go slowly, carefully and with your tail between your legs.  So you cannot carry a weapon and the flashlight at the same time? Boo-hoo, I'll let you in on a little secret... (whispering) This is a design feature... (/whispering)  Don't you think there were a gazillion beta testers who had complained about it first?  Don't you guys think that fumbling the flashlight with your weapon adds more to the tension? I think you get the picture.  Oh, but don't worry, the flashlight won't help much after finding Hell (if you get there before telling your priest to exorcise the Doom box)  The campaign mode takes about 20-25 hours to complete, which is enough time to either make you pee on your pants or convert you into a KISS member.  I played with the default settings, only that I reversed the vertical aim (up is down and viceversa).  So, go buy it.. now!.

Usually I play games with the sound turned off while listening to TV shows, but this music is very ambient and relaxing.  You even get happy little chimes when you lose, it softens the blow!  Zenses: Ocean includes 6 different games.  Zen Stones is a matching game, very similar to one of the casino minigames in Super Mario DS.  Pearl Diver requires you to draw lines from one matching pearl to another in order to get them to disappear.  Turtle Turn asks you to change the shell colors to make them match the pattern on the top screen.  Hot Spot asks you to assemble floating crustacean parts to make a fancy creature to match the one on the top screen.  Shell Twirl has you match shells to a rotating pattern in the center.  Wave Breaker is a little bit like Concentration - that might be the most relaxing one, I get so hypnotized watching waves wash over seashells that I kind of forget to pay attention.

The game is fast paced, and it's a ton of fun.  I wish they'd made more than one version for PS3.  I would give this 4.5 stars if I could, only for the lack of courses.

The sights of Seattle are totally breathtaking and the amount of detail shown in the characters faces is unreal.  Also, this is one of the few games that really utilizes the new features of the DualShock 4 controller.  The touchpad and the speaker are both used in very cool ways for this game.  The gameplay is also very fun.  I think its a bit challenging, but not so hard that you will want to throw your controller across the room and give up.  I like that there is a specific storyline, but that there is also this open world that you can explore as well as tons of side missions.  I find myself wanting to play so that I can complete every single part of this game.  I have probably already put around 8-10 hours into it and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface - talk about getting your moneys worth!

I guess it will only be catering to the young children but then I noticed that while it's cartoonish (which I personally like) it's also for adults to exercise.  There are an impressive 155 exercises on here & I just received this game so obviously I haven't done all of them yet.  So far I'm pleased with the ""Dance Exercises"" ""Martial Arts"" & ""Body Conditioning"".  You use 2 motion remote controllers & follow along.  The instructions are clearly mentioned & follow the arrows & lines on the screen.  It may look like you can cheat & just stand still & move your arms but you really do get a better score (& better workout of course) if you move your entire body like the cartoon instructor is doing.  While your Mii (wii avatar) ""travels around the globe in between games, that's a great time to drink ice water while you're waiting the short time.  It doesn't take very long & the children love that part.  Since it's appealing to kids,  it's easy to get them involved in the game too.  So far, I've noticed similarities to the Wii Fit: the workout calendar automatically logging in your day's progress - your workout time, calories burned & other stats.  The Wii Balance Board is used for the ""Party Fitness"" & ""Pirate Attack"" games, however I haven't done either of those yet. There are 8 workout categories: Latin Dance, Hip Hop, Aerobics, Yoga/Pilates, Boxercising, Karate, & Karate Forms. You can create personalized exercise program focusing on ""arms & shoulders"", ""chest"", ""waist"", ""back"", ""legs & hips"" (they forgot to include ""bottom"" to that list, but that's ok).

That was a fair price, because five dollars is about all Wii Play is worth.  Pros (with a few cons): Combat is back. This game would be one star material if not for its Combat clone, which is called Tanks. Unlike the hit Atari 2600 game that it emulates, this game doesn't require two people to play. In that way, it's actually better than the original.  Duck Hunt is partially back in the form of Wii Play's Shooting Gallery. However, Duck Hunt was a much better game than this. You're actually shooting targets and the ducks are there for bonus points. Furthermore, the game ends far too quickly. If you want to play Duck Hunt (which is far more enjoyable than Wii Play), hunt down a NES.  Cons:  The pool game only has 9-ball, and it doesn't even follow the accepted rules of 9-ball.

If you played NASCAR 15 on PS3 & thought this was going to be a major upgrade, get ready to be upset. The only thing about this game that makes it slightly better than NASCAR 15 is that it's on the PS4. I was expecting an in depth career mode, paintshop & such. Well the game doesn't even have paintshop on it, I mean I used to spend hours on NASCAR 15 just painting cars. The career mode is one where you pick male or female, car type & number, that is it. You can customize the appearance of your driver but it's kinda dumb cause you only see their face in the garage menu screen. You choose sponsors during your career BUT you cannot change the look of the car, it changes on it's own depending on what sponsor you pick. The game doe's not keep yearly track of wins, poles, top 5's whatever during your career. If you care, you have to do it yourself. I am currently in my 4rth career season. You start off rock bottom with a car slower than a mule and have to build your car & team up with race winnings & sponsor money so it's gonna take a while, you can choose the arcade get in & drive setting or go full sim have to make your own adjustments to the car. The race winnings are weird too, for instance the Daytona 500 only pays $112,000 to win BUT the season finale in Homestead pays $1.2 million. For as bad as the car you have to start off with is, in my rookie year I still managed to win a race, (2nd season race at Martinsville, Goody's 500) and I finished 20th in points. Now the game doe's keep yearly track of the final points so you can go back & see how you've done in previous points standings BUT that's it. The current Chase format is in effect & because of that I have yet, in my 4rth year & have yet to win the Sprint Cup. The Homestead race is really tough & if you make it to the final 4, best believe at least 2 of the other 3 drivers are almost always going to start among the top 4 spots. You always get horrible starts & restarts so at least one of the guys you have to race always drives away & you can't catch'em no matter how hard you try. At the end of season 3, it was me, Harvick, Kes & Carl. I reset the game like 20 times & everytime Harvick & Keselowski started the race in the top 4 and one of them drove off at the start not to be caught, I finally gave up and just let Harvick win cause not a fan of Kes. You can also play a single season with an existing Cup car and that's much easier, I won the Sprint Cup with the 46 Pilot car. So in the end I'll say this, if your a diehard expecting greatness, pass on this one BUT if your just a casual fan or just don't care then try it out, I haven't even tried to play online yet, if you've played NASCAR 15 online, then you already know I'm sure this isn't much different.",i'm a little disappointed in this one,1474156800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",,know track away weird hard female menu horrible play manage doe's much i'll reset thought rock drive mule carl nascar career like depend hour start pole upset start among guy try goody's time car sponsor least can't get driver chase dumb mode upgrade point restart thing pick change take greatness instance sure disappointed slightly already gonna different kinda pilot money well finale appearance season little really keselowski that's one format play depth face win paintshop change back whatever sim currently arcade sprint sponsor let go believe easy slow set single exist win type online use male effect ready team pay major number cannot full almost screen winning spend cup rookie top everytime martinsville bad homestead game fan also still casual finally even see start matter harvick bottom garage standing million catch current make adjustment choose daytona catch'em kes build spot i'm car pas customize yearly best yet diehard finish mean driver race previous drive look tried end make expect tough cause go well year always say do drive final keep painting care give

The game offers a variety of modes (Adventure, Versus, Destruction, Melee).  While Destruction is pointless, the other modes should give the game some longevity.  The addition of Bots for the Melee mode boosts the replay value well above the GC version. The drawback to the gameplay is the collision detection.  At times, your character can be standing right next to a building and not be able to pick it up.  Even more annoying is getting hit when you should be out of the opponents sites.

And god help you if you so much as brush against a Crimson Guard.  Also, while the zoomers were fun, there were several points you had to drive like mad from here to there and you just kept sliding into walls because the zoomers were so loose in the stearing dept.  Despite this I LOVED Jak II.  Took my time in beating it, sort of savoring it.  If JakIII does nothing but expand a bit over number 2 (new weapons, vehicles, some new territory ect) it would be well worth it to me.

To start with, after about a week of playing fairly regularly I haven't played on the same map yet.  The missions are more varied where Enemy Unknown had three or four basic mission types.  The addition of the human faction EXALT has introduced the opportunity for different scenarios.  The timed retrieval requirement for the resource called Meld also introduces an element of pressure and adds a different dynamic to game play.  There are so many things added it's hard to keep track, from simple little things like new helmets, sunglasses and goggles to the MEC Warriors and Genetics Lab.  At first I didn't see myself using the MEC suits much; I really never cared for the S.H.I.V.s in Enemy Unknown.  Now though one of my favorite tactics is running up and punching a Muton across the map.  MEC Warriors are powerful but can't take cover so they are well balanced and require a certain amount of planning to use.  In some of the later missions something happens that really makes using the MEC enjoyable and leads to a pretty cinematic fight.  I don't want to give it away though.  This DLC is a little different than most DLCs I've purchased.  It doesn't rely on the previous game and you don't really even need Enemy Unknown.  The two games share a few missions almost exactly.  The tutorials are the same and so far one of the VIP rescue missions is taken right from Enemy Unknown.  It seems like a quirky system but with the large amount of content I don't feel cheated.  It seems to me that the gameplay pace is slowed down and more relaxed with Enemy Within.  I'm able to research the things that interest me more than the things I need to survive but if you've played Enemy Unknown you know that decisions made early  can come back to haunt you later.  I've actually wrecked some play thru's of EU by researching the wrong things.  So far I can tell that some of my decisions are making missions a little harder but I also feel like I will be able to correct this and get back on track.  I don't want to say this game is easier but there are definitely elements added that make choices more forgiving and enhance the soldier's ability and survivability.  So far I have not encountered the glitches and other issues some reviewers are reporting.  I've only been playing for a week though so we'll see.  This is a tough game and frustrating at times but if you are willing to take your time (you definitely can't run and gun) and apply strategy it is a very rewarding game.",Great Improvement On An Already Great Game,1411257600,3.0,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},,"give know retrieval track away hard reviewer play much amount use i've report type introduces way scenario like element warrior mission helmet meld pace powerful share week interest four need come actually survivability eu opportunity slow time can't enjoyable sunglass get encounter haunt favorite rescue many within seem take dlc definitely hard addition something gun make element simple take different later feel faction well ability balance fairly dynamic strategy little thing really exalt one enemy play muton lab thru's new back tell care make unknown right add wrong far frustrating we'll able easy goggles suit punch large vary first enhance game want certain almost across early add finding time purchase s.h.i.v.s tactic cinematic wreck issue introduce also game mec pressure rely choice see even start data-hook=""product-link-linked timed forgive class=""a-link-normal cheated human lead quirky mission playstation make willing glitch never require reward play run i'm dlcs two decision map liked&nbsp;<a yet correct gameplay previous cover soldier's though system run content call tutorial fight happens make vip basic regularly resource tough use well relaxed genetics research say three exactly research requirement every survive apply keep planning pretty"

JAGELLA,"When I purchased a computer system in November 2000 to upgrade my aging PC, a game title I had in mind was Unreal Tournament (UT).  After spending just a short while with UT, I realized it was a winner.  This game defined the clich ""thrill of victory and agony of defeat.""  I was almost afraid to play it because I hated to lose, but was it great to win!  Playing Unreal Tournament set the stage for Unreal Tournament 2003 (UT2003), but progress does not always fulfill one's hopes. UT2003 is a good shooter.  It is a very good looking game with realistic effects like fire, swirling clouds, and rounded surfaces.  It's rendering of shiny metal objects is perhaps the best I've seen in any game.  The bots work well in single player, and the AI has been improved so much over UT that it's almost impossible to beat the bots in the tougher difficulty settings (at least I couldn't).  The sound and music are good too. The drawbacks of UT2003 include fairly high system requirements.  I could run it on my Pentium III system, but the frame rates noticeably dropped when a lot of bots were on screen.  Even on my 3 GHz Pentium IV system the game will sometimes slow down noticeably.  Also, I thought that the weapons weren't as good as in UT.  The sniper rifle, one of the best weapons I've seen in any game, was replaced by a ""lightning gun.""  I hate this weapon!  You've got to wait several seconds for it to recharge, and we all know what waiting results in when we are being attacked by bots or players intent on killing us. UT2003 and Unreal II, just aren't what they could be, and they are a step down from their predecessors.  I would love to see the developers of these Unreal games return to their roots.

Honestly, it's just not fair, but as gamers we have grown used to the fact that Japan is our spoiled brother that gets all the good stuff. Image our surprise, however, when I game has been fully translated and voiced in the English tongue, and is then released in PAL territories but not in the US. That's just cold. That's like having three kids, giving 2 of those kids a bar of chocolate and then sending the third to his room. This is what happened with The Last Story, as well as two other games - Xenoblade Chronicles and Pandora's Tower. So, what is going to happen to that third kid in our previous scenario? He's pissed. IT makes no sense. He is going to whine, and cry, and hate you until you drive back to the store, and get him his chocolate bar - and that's exactly what American gamers did in a sense. These three Wii exclusives spawned ""Operation Rainfall"" - a petition to get all of these games released in America. Lo and behold, our temper tantrum was mostly a success (2 of 3 were released), and here I am reviewing a game I thought I'd never get to play.  The Last Story is the most recent game from Mistwalker Studios, which was created by famed Final Fantasy creator Hironobu sakaguchi. He claimed to have gone into this project with the same mindset as when eh created the original Final Fantasy, and it certainly shows. even the logo and name are very close to Final Fantasy! To top it off, the games music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, who also composed the music of Final Fantasy. In short, the art style, music, and story will all remind you quite directly of Final Fantasy - but it has more than enough strength to stand on its own.  The Last Story just kind of throws you right into the action when you start - you fight your first battle within the first 5 minutes. Throughout this segment, the characters are having flashbacks and bantering about things and just confusing you in general. It wasn't until about an hour in that I finally understood everything that went on in those first few moments. The gameplay, however, was too engrossing for me to care.  the battle system in The Last Story takes place in real time, and there are no ""battle screens"", just a seamless environment. You control the main character, Zael, most of the time and the rest of your party is autonomous. Eventually, you can give them orders. The game is best played with a classic controller of some type, but I will get to that later - for now, I am going to use a classic controller to explain the controls. The R button guards. Likewise, if you are holding R and run toward an obstacle (or an ally), you will jump, or propel yourself over it. The L button activates an ability you get early on called ""Gathering"" which draws all enemy attention to Zael .this allows your spell casters you charge without being interrupted by enemies, or can also just take the heat off of your allies if they're taking a beating. If while moving the Y or a button is pressed, Zael will somersault in that direction. You may have gathered by now that, though an RPG, this game is full of action. In order to attack, you simply run to and enemy, and press the control stick in their direction - much like how Link jumps in a Zelda game if you run towards and edge. You can also adjust the controls via the options menu if you would rather press b to attack. Using this method will allow for a couple of minor advantages, but since your attacks are slowed down a small bit as well, and will also do a little less damage, I found it best to just stick to the ""automatic"" method.  You should not assume that because you have attacking set to automatic that the game is uninvolved. You must still guard properly, examine enemy strategies and issue commands accordingly by pressing up on the directional pad. Later in the game, Zael get an ability called ""Perfect Guard"". If you tap guard at just the right moment, you will not only parry your enemies strike, but deliver a brutal counter attack. zael also has an ability known as ""Gale"". Whenever a mage in your party casts a spell, it creates a magic circle on the ground. By holding b, you initiate Gale, which allows you to diffuse these circles for effects such as silence, armor break, and health distribution depending on the spell. Likewise, you can diffuse enemy spell circles to get rid of them. Furthermore, walking through spell circles adds that spell's attributes to your weapon for a limited time. There are also moments where you will have to strategically use your crossbow.  Your crossbow is used by holding the ZL button. You can cycle through various arrows suited to different enemy types with the directional pad. Using the crossbow, you can find environmental weaknesses, such as broken rocks, or enemies on far off platforms and then choose to either use your crossbow to solve the problem, or order a magic caster to deal with it. Beyond this, if enemies haven't notice you are there, you can press against cover wit the a button. From here, you can use your crossbow to grab an enemies attention and lure them in for a stealth kill. The crossbow is the reason I recommend playing with a Classic Controller Pro. On a regular Classic Controller, the ZL and ZR buttons are located beside the L and R buttons, as opposed to the Classic Controller Pro which has a more tradition Playstation styled setup that makes using the crossbow a little easier. That is not to say the game cannot be played comfortably with the Classic controller - I, in fact, played the majority of this game with the Classic Controller due to not owning a Pro until the later chapters. The Wiimore and Nunchuk controls look comfortable and easy enough to use if yiu have to, but I'd have to recommend a classic controller of some kind. As for gameplay issues, they mostly come from your partner's lack of intelligence. Your allies will often get themselves killed doing something silly.  Considering the limitations of the Wii's hardware, this game looks amazing. There are a few blurry textures here and there, but overall the game just looks great. Characters are well animated, and environments are relatively believable. Another parallel to the Final Fantasy games of old are the cutscenes. Cutscenes in The Last Story are pre-rendered, much like those in Final Fantasy 7, 8 and 9. They of course, looks far better than those cutscenes, and have voice acting as well. It is strange to see this in a modern RPG, but it is not a problem at all. Even when the game is not pre-rendered there is a lot of attention to detail. every piece of equipment or weapon you put on a character changes their appearance. If you decide you don't like the color of their equipment, you can change the color scheme in the menu.  The characters are all colorful and interesting, and each of them has their own little quirks. the cast babbles near constantly, and their banter is pretty comical from time to time, especially when Syrenne and Lowell get into it. I'd love to delve into the characters and how their stories intertwine, but to do so would ruin the whole game - I can't even explain very much of the beginnings without spoiling something. all I can reveal is that Zael is unhappy with his life as a mercenary, and wishes to become a knight. That may sound simple, and shallow, but there are a lot of things I'm not telling you here, and there is plenty of drama involved. At times the story is predictable, but not to the point that it is uninteresting.  If you live in America, and you are thinking of purchasing this game, do so as soon as you possibly can because we only got a single shipment of the product. On the bright side, the packaging goes well beyond what most games offer for $50, giving you a book-like enclosure as well as a 44 page art booklet. Unfortunately, the sound track was only available for pre-order copies. The Last Story is an interesting, outstanding, beautiful, and above all else, fun addition to your Wii library. I can only think of so many bad things to say about this game, and those few things pale greatly in comparison to all the praise I didn't even give it in this review.",Proof that good things can be done on the Wii,1346198400,4.0,,,think comical pro go heat cold advantage jump attack consider banter arrow notice nunchuk project cast edge shallow image room directional animate pre-order time spoil last hironobu tradition get weapon many review allow certainly temper happen press armor different later possibly spell's direction copy surprise create ability voice uninteresting mage fun drama charge enemy control understood success original setup logo right attack point far recent soon kind easier limited type cry couple rock kill chocolate hour bit stuff somersault guard strike interrupt brother outstanding would japan method booklet everything bad tower believable tantrum finally jump controller creator gathering sound order unhappy release show main either fantasy propel break constantly stick set overall two cycle gameplay without system call fight greatly delve diffuse hardware they're wit every may wish small praise review give piss beside limitation much drive tongue think character type button wii pad spoil like wii's tap weaknesses mindset parallel sakaguchi come character take america pal caster health slow product toward can't studio modern brutal name within due button effect problem color compose partner's circle zael well involved ally unfortunately appearance opposed minor mercenary examine grow page pre-rendered love change flashback whine whole relatively engross hold predictable ruin english caster strange translate likewise distribution strategically become quirk first uematsu solve add time hate game beginning various give top damage issue general game also link still attention voice see accordingly explain remind intertwine press grab story side choose create moment play style pandora's since classic story old though run take nobuo allows comparison kill adjust spawn use three exactly library he's rather activate syrenne menu play command magic use bright obstacle break banter kid ally order however recommend comfortably automatic simply near know xenoblade think counter pale parry enclosure environment suit circle whenever enough i'd eventually take claimed change third must strategies go less purchasing find draws music interest little thing silly lowell babble course attack offer lot go back deal place american eh crossbow sense regular beautiful cutscenes enemy act autonomous good single use reveal beat game honestly scenario early attribute own get mostly segment rainfall throw close strength start plenty art majority playstation kid piece i'm best move chronicle often equipment famed previous look life throughout happen assume initiate well say another get final colorful platform chapter exclusive care control stand look track via furthermore cast directly option detail find quite packaging rid petition mistwalker screen depend properly environment world perfect moment action press towards book-like gale something addition great simple bar minute spell real amazing zl lo textures put that's fact play issue walk gamers behold beyond reason live intelligence go environmental operation tell comfortable zelda wiimore lack cannot full fully shipment lure seamless especially zr fair knight territory yiu even battle guard ground gather stealth easy rest else locate deliver rpg never short uninvolved cover confuse scheme blurry make party send available decide style silence store pretty

Portrait of a Thief"" was a very addicting game but, after several chapters, it became mind-numbingly repetitive and the whole mystery solving theme got lost. The storyline is that you are a detective who is trying to solve the case of paintings missing from a gallery. You need to gather evidence by finding objects in various locations in the town. You progress through 20 chapters in the case. After finding all the required objects in a chapter, you solve a puzzle. These puzzles can be either piecing a jigsaw puzzle together, completing a word search, matching pictures that complement each other, or putting tiles together to form a picture. Once the puzzle is complete, you are given new information about the case which begins a new chapter with more items to find and a puzzle at the end and so on.  The locations were diverse and interesting and some of the items were very well hidden. The locations were easy to see for the most part; however, I noticed in airports the lighting made the game very dark and almost impossible to play. For added challenge, sometimes descriptions were not what they seemed. An ""eye,"" for example, could be an Egyptian-style drawing of a eye, the word ""eye"" or simply an eye. If the list included more than one ""bat"" that could mean a flying bat and a baseball bat. The music was rather pleasant, but also repetitive and could get stuck in your head.  As repetitive as the music was, so was the game play. After finishing several chapters, the same locations kept coming up and the game became tiring seek and find. Unlike ""Chronicles of Mystery: Curse of the Ancient Temple,"" for example, I never felt like the game was a mystery.  ""Chronicles"" is a seek and find game with puzzles as well but there is interaction with the locations that gives a sense of detective work.  ""Mystery P.I."" did not offer such interaction.  The search areas and puzzles were independent of the storyline.  There was absolutely no crime-solving thought involved. The investigation just progressed as I completed the chapters.  The re-playability of the game is low, in my opinion, because I got so sick of seeing the same places and looking for the same things. Some of the descriptions used are strange, too. A ""bumbershoot"" is an umbrella, for example. I guess the game taught me something. In conclusion, toward the end, I tried to finish the chapters as quickly as possible and was disappointed when a new chapter started as I just wanted to finish the game and move on to something else.

860,475246,5,False,"06 10, 2009",AIR57G6ARRC5P,B001LW033U,waterbowl,"This is one of the better ""Gauntlet clones"" that I've played recently. It combines simple action rpg elements with simple town building. It's meant to be played in 30 minutes or to over 4 hours, depending on play style and options used. I'm having a lot of fun with it.  I really like the graphics and art. The graphics remind me of Darkstone, the art reminds me a little bit of The Temple of Elemental Evil and even Icewind Dale. The music is standard fantasy, you've heard it all before in other games, but I like that kind of music, and this music is great. I won't be putting it on mute anytime soon!  Character customization is lacking. I enjoy customizing my character, but all that I get to choose here is a name, portrait, and class. There isn't that many portraits to choose from, just a few for each race, but there is a good variety of classes. There is also a good variety of models. Some are fatter than others, some have short hair and some have long hair, there are white people and black people. You just can't pick when creating your character(ex. a courtesan will always be skinny, a brawler will always be bigger. Can't make a skinny brawler. However, skin color is based on portrait used).  The city building part of the game is a lot of fun. From deciding which guys you want in your town, which buildings to upgrade, and where to place your buildings. Having to manage food, search the map for resources for the town, and defending the town against attackers. Some buildings even have more than one upgrade option. Starting out by yourself and building a town from nothing is part of the fun.  Combat is just the basic old style of action rpg. You raise your attack and defense as you fight, gain levels and raise stats and gain new skills, find new armor, weapons and items, left click the mouse to attack till the monsters fall down. Even though it's just like it was years ago, it's still fun here. They even made it easier for you, with auto equipping and using as few left clicks as possible. Having people in town auto-equip and the auto-sorting makes things so much easier. If I have someone in my town guarding it against attackers, I don't have to worry about making sure they equip newly made weapons and armor, they do it themselves, freeing me up to continue my adventure for loot and resources.  Something else that I like, is the ability to take your townspeople and have them fight with you. Take the priest out of his church and have him fight with you, healing you in battle. Or take the farmer from their field and slap some armor on them. You can have up to 3 npc's fight with you. I enjoy the challenge of creating an all female town. Because men and women will come to your town looking to build, I always have to kick the men out, waiting for more women to show up.  The interface is just perfect. Everything is made easy. Looting monsters and from chests takes a split second, selling is as easy as pressing shift and left clicking, there's auto-sorts and auto-equips, the menus are all easily accessed and any important information is just a single left click away. It truly makes an rpg and town building easy.  I would love a game like this with more depth. There are no dungeons to enter, you can only explore above ground. Entering dungeons, having more detailed quests, and having a more robust economy side would have made this game lots better. As a casual action rpg with town building in it, I don't see how it could get any better on the casual side.  A note about the DRM used. There isn't any. There's no cd key. The game cd doesn't need to be in the drive to play.  5 stars overall: The game plays smooth on my medium range computer. The game only crashed once in 10 hours of play.

Over the course of the game you will obtain new and more powerful cards and can build your own deck to suit your needs. The problem is, the game does a terrible job of explaining how it all works. It will throw you helpful tips in between missions but it'll usually tell you something very vital many mission after you needed it. At first I thought this game was really cool when I started it but it soon became too frustrating. The low point for me was when I snuck up right behind an unsuspecting soldier, emptied two clips of an AK-47 into him, and he STILL did not die. I understand that DEF and Body Armor can play a huge role in these games but that is just ridiculous. It seems almost impossible to stay stealthy in this game which is what Metal Gear is all about.

They must have gotten to big and are getting dragged down by to many cooks and kitchen(Bad management that used to be great talent but now camp and only bog down the real creatives). It is obvious that dragging out release dates is no longer for a high quality products and is just to cobble together a mesh-mash of yesteryear's leftovers. Granted all they do is re-release the same three games :-P but so far they have been doing great at improving them and adding to the muiltiplayer experience and normally have a good story line to go with it. On a side note I can believe it takes them more than two years to try to make the second part/ expansion of StarCraft II. Diablo 3 is an EXACT copy of Diablo 2. This may sound like a good thing but computers have change a little in the last 10 years and it is just not up to snuff. The story line is also very weak. My advice if you want the feeling of playing Diablo again remember what made it great. It was the first of the MMORPG's it was not quite there but it got people thinking about what could be done and playing together online. This could have been a great blend bringing the classic dungeon game to somewhat massive multiplayer but with only one to a max of 3 other people in your game it is a compleate failure and a relic of the past nothing new to see here move along and find a real MMORPG or a rpg or strategy game that can support at least 8 to 12 players in the same game.,Blizzards first flop,1338595200,16.0,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},,feel look second product think move compleate find quite drag long somewhat like love yesteryear's player could grant snuff improve guess try last normally least multiplayer nothing high many thing expansion change big great dungeon camp drag cook later real must creatives advice mmorpg's starcraft line strategy little obvious muiltiplayer one part new max quality make mmorpg bring mesh-mash relic exact flop far ii believe good online use add diablo together first copy game want remember get date blend game also re-release weak see leftover blizzard year release talent kitchen(bad sound side make experience cobble rpg bog massive gotten playing sooner failure two classic story along management take people happen go past get computer three note do every may support

I had to give it four stars instead of five for a couple reasons. When looking at the collection in it's entirety(1-5) this one seems to offer almost the least. I'm sure when it was new it offered the most, but since then they have re-released 1 and 2. Dead or Alive 1 offers the least(and feels different then the rest) but they added TONS of costumes to Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate. I picked up all of them up at the same time. So, comparing them like that, Dead or Alive 3 does offer plenty, but you will find more in the others with the exception of the first. Another thing to point out; I played these on my Xbox 360 and the only compatibility issues I had were with Dead or Alive 3. Some of the ending clips either skip or don't play at all.

If you are experiencing audio lag, the problem is the HDMI cable. You need to run the audio from the RCA (red and white) cables through the tv, headphones, or an external stereo/surround sound system. Doing so will fix the annoying audio lag problem I'm sure most people will experience. So if you buy the game, don't forget about this tip!    Here is a little background about myself to support my experience playing the game: I am a musician and I've played guitar for a number of years. However, I've always played basic rhythm guitar. I never got around to learning scales, solos, power chords, ect... only regular chords for rhythm.    Now for the game. I have only played it for about 2 hours so far, and I am really enjoying the experience. I'm a pretty busy person, and I often feel guilty when playing video games because even though I do enjoy playing, I feel like it eats up time I could use for more productive activities. Finally, I have a game that I don't have to feel bad about playing for hours on end! I am a worship leader at a church, so guitar is part of my job. Not only is this game fun to play, but I can see how it is going to help my abilities on guitar grow tremendously! The interface is similar to Rockband or Guitar Hero, but the developers did a superb job at modifying the familier interface to work well with a real guitar. It may feel awkward at first, but stick with it, and you will get it. After a few songs, I felt like I was playing Guitar Hero, and it was mind boggling to think I was playing a real guitar. Considering I already have experience playing, the game felt oversimplified starting out, but it was still worth playing to get a feel for the interface. It didn't take long for the game to start getting a little challenging. The game adjusts on the fly to how well you are playing, so don't worry what level player you are. If you have never played guitar before, it will keep things simple for you. If you are an expert on guitar, it may take a little longer, but it will adjust to your skill level. There is so much to say about the game, but I'm limited on time. I just wanted to get a quick review out for anyone considering the game so that you can know this is a game worth buying.

I had been waiting in rage forever and the controls seemed tough on this one early in the game so I put it aside and played Rage. After that I was hesitant to start this up again because of the controls but I liked the other aspects of the game early on so I eventually decided to get back to this. SO GLAD I did!  For those of you having trouble with the controls at first, please...stick to it! Once you get used to it and it clicks in with your hand/eye coordination  the controls actually work very well and feel much better. I'd say it took me about 4 hours of play to truely get used to them and another hour after that to be able to use them freely without thought, but after that it's so good you will have trouble believing you ever had issues with the controls.  As for the game itself, it is so much fun I almost can't stand it. You can get VERY creative with kills and limb dismemberment and some of the areas are suffucating and claustrophibic which is GOOD in a zombie game. The tension is unreal. I played single player mostly but want to find a few people to go through this again in co-op with because the co-op I DID play was infinitely better than this already tight, fun game.  The things that bring this down to a 4 aren't TOO bad but I can't give it a perfect score. I'll preface it with this though, the game is GREAT, it's worth playing so don't let the following deter you. There are way too many ""fortify the area"" type parts for my liking. This isn't necessarily bad, some may love this aspect of the game, but I myself liked it for the first few times I needed to do it but staled on it after a while. Another thing is that it DOES take so much time to get used to the control scheme. Like I said above though, it IS worth the effort. There were also quite a few bugs. Not any game breakers that I ran into, but plenty of minor ones that forced reloads and a few that had me resorting to looking up a solution on the internet. The good thing is that there WERE solutions to be found with a simple search, so no game breakers but it was a hassle when I needed to do this.

888,31961,5,False,"04 21, 2002",ATL84JW0KKIMJ,B00005V8TW,Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr.,"Let me begin by noting you don't have to be a fan of comics or superheroes to enjoy this game, but for those of you that are, this is the game you've been waiting for.  While Freedom Force is obviously based on the works of Jack Kirby and to a lesser degree Stan Lee, it manages to capture the feel of the silver age of comics.  It captures the tone, the powers, the corny origins, the melodramatic dialogue, and best of all those flashy costumes in a way that borrows from but pays homage to all those familiar characters we know and love.  What's funny is that it doesn't glaze over some of the stereotypes from the era either.... Freedom Force is a squad based tactical RPG, or so it's been called.  In PC game terms, studio's seem to add ""RPG"" to any game that allows you to create characters or update them through experience.  Either way this game is a lot less Fallout or Baldur's Gate, and a lot more Fallout: Tactics and X-Com.  Controlling up to four characters (I would have been a lot happier with five or six) at a time, all with various strengths and weaknesses, you guide your hero's on a variety of missions with specific goals that must be accomplished to move on to the next episode.  You might be required to save structures or people or capture a bad guy, but there is a definite mission that must be accomplished. One of the coolest features of the game is the ability to interact with EVERYTHING on the screen.  Want to pick up a car and toss it at some baddies?  No problem.  Want to pull a light pole out of the ground and use it like a baseball bat?  Simple, and one of my favorite tactics I might add.  On the downside, damage to buildings and civilians can hurt your prestige.  Get trigger happy with grenades or area attacks and buildings will collapse all around you.  On the other hand, walking into a super-villains fortress gives you an open licence to go nuts.  Blow it all up if you want to, and you can. When the mission is over, characters gain experience, adding the subtle RPG element, and when they've gotten enough they are given character points you can use to upgrade powers, buy new powers and generally improve them.  In addition to experience points, the team gets prestige points you can use to add new team-members to your roster.  XP's are usually set, but you can pick up additional PP's by completing secondary missions, beating up bad guys etc. The characters themselves are awesome.  I had a hard time deciding which ones I wanted to use, because of the coolness factor, but tactics usually made the decision for me.  Most of the characters will join your team without using prestige points.  You start with Minute Man, an obvious Homage to Captain America, and from there you come into contact with more and more heroes, most of whom want to join your team, some who have to be coerced with prestige (I advise picking up Man O' War ASAP.  He sounds like Sean Connery and he generally kicks butt.)  The origins are hysterical, and made me laugh out loud with their charming corniness. If you want to really mix things up, you can make up your own character and use prestige points to get them into the game.  You'll also probably want to do this for the multiplayer games anyway.  You can use the skins that are already on the game, or you can make your own.  There are several sights that have thousands of pre-generated skins based on pre-existing heroes from DC, Marvel and other comics.  If you want to make your own, you're going to need to download the mesh editor at the official web site.  You can even make your own powers. I had a blast playing this game.  It's the most fun I've had with a PC game since Baldur's Gate 2 which was probably the best game I've ever played. I loved the characters, the missions were fun and multi-player with custom characters rules.  The only two complaints Ican muster is that the single player is a little too short and I wish the squads were a little bigger.  Hopefully the flexibility of the engine means that there are further expansions and episodes on the way (you hear that Irrational?  Let the saga continue). Cool note to parents: this thing has a ""Teen"" rating, but to me, this thing is a lot less violent than an actual comic book and deserves a lower rating.  No one dies, there's no blood, and the goal is to protect life not destroy it.  For those parents out there concerned about letting their kids participate in first person blood baths should consider getting this game for them instead.

While it is true that this is *mostly* a port of the fantastic platformer from a couple years back, there are definitely enough additions and differences to make this a game that may be the preferred version among fans. Seeing how this is a game that has, for the most part, been accessible since 2010, I'll focus mainly on discussing the differences between this version and the original and whether or not you'll want to even bother buying this.

The level design and game mechanics are amazingly well-crafted, the difficulty and satisfaction in the game is huge, and most importantly, the control mechanics are so tight you can bounce a quarter off of the game and make change. Much like the original DKC trilogy, the gameplay has an awesome rhythmic quality to it. Yes, the game may be missing King K. Rool and the Kremlings as villains, and many of DK's relatives we've all come to know and love don't show up, but for the most part, Donkey Kong Country Returns really is the quintessential Donkey Kong game, and should not be missed. If you never got a change to play the original (god forbid), then this is a wonderful time to get into it, for certain.  So what are the main additions/differences between DKCR3D and the original? First off, the controls are obviously different. The Wii original used the motion-control capability of the Wiimote to good effect, in my opinion. I thought the waggle activated actions worked well for the most part, but it did have its issues that could really add frustration in intense platforming sections. I know of many people who hated that part of the original. For those who weren't so enthusiastic about the motion, you'll be happy to know that has all been replaced by traditional button presses, obviously. So basically, you will have a different experience when it comes to rolling, blowing, ground-pounding, etc. Otherwise, the super tight controls are the same.  There is a bit of extra content that has been added to the game this time around. After you beat the game, a whole new ""world"" of levels becomes accessible that are quite fun and unique to play through. Many of the settings of these new levels fit the themes found in the original world levels, but are brand new, such as one on a huge, low-leveled riverbed in a forest. They look and play great. The original had a ton of content, but these new additions are very nice indeed.  While DKCR is definitely a fun game, there's no doubt that it's also by far one of the most challenging platformers of the past decade or so. This definitely adds a huge level of satisfaction to the game, but it also stands as a huge barrier of entry to younger or less experienced gamers. For those people, Nintendo has added an ""easy mode"" of sorts to the game that greatly reduces the challenge. Some changes in this mode include DK and Diddy getting three hearts by default instead of two, power-ups that reduce damage, green balloons that save you if you were to fall into a bottomless pit, etc. To be honest, I'm torn on this. On one hand, I appreciate making a hard game more accessible so everyone can enjoy it. On the other hand, this ""easy mode"" makes the game almost insultingly easy by comparison. It's not too bad though, because ""original mode"" is still available, so if you crave the soul-crushing difficulty of the original, you can still play it that way, which is great.  Well, that's most of the major changes/additions you can expect from this game. I'm very impressed with the port-job the game received. Very little was sacrificed to get the game to play on Nintendo's handheld. You'll notice some details in the visuals are a bit toned down. After all, the 3DS isn't quite up to the Wii's specs, but it does still look great for the most part. DKCR is a splendidly detailed game, and it's worth noting that having all that shrunk to the 3DS(XL)'s screen size can get crowded at times. The cool 3-D effect, while nonessential for the gameplay itself, is really enjoyable to look at. Some portions of the game, such as the special silhouette levels, look really awesome in 3-D. The only problem I have with 3-D is that when action is heavy, sometimes the frame rate stutters ever-so-slightly, which can be a problem in a precision platformer like this. It's also worth noting that, while the original DKCR ran in 60 fps on the Wii, this version has been toned down to 30 fps, again, due to the difference in tech. While this is a shame, it really doesn't affect what a good time you'll be having. It still plays fantastic. Overall, Monster Games, the developer who did most of the work porting this game (they also made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilotwings-Resort/dp/B002I08VDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilotwings Resort</a>), did a pretty fantastic job.  So, whether you played the original DKCR and salivate at the idea of it being portable, having extra content, and a new control scheme, or you're a newbie who has never even touched the game before, I'd say Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is definitely a game you'll want to buy. I understand veterans of the original may not want to dish out the cash to play the game again, even with the aforementioned additions, but I did, and I'm glad I did. DKCR was the game that proved Retros Studios was a top-tier developer whose genius in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metroid-Prime-Trilogy/dp/B002ATY7JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a>&nbsp;was not luck or a one-off success (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/and-it-appears-Retro-isn-t-quite-done-making-DK-games-Can-t-wait-for-DK-Tropical-Freeze-it-looks-amazing-already/dp/B00DC7O77A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">and it appears Retro isn't quite done making DK games. Can't wait for DK Tropical Freeze, it looks amazing already!</a>). They really hit this one out of the park. Personally, I can only think of a few ""flatformers"" that I enjoyed as much or more than I did with DKCR, and now I can enjoy it again on the go with this 3DS version. It's a fantastic game that simply should not be missed if you consider yourself a fan of Nintendo, DK, platformers, or just plain awesome games in general.

Anyway, this game was amazing. Technically, there weren't necessarily any real upgrades from Far Cry 3 as far as gameplay and such goes, although the graphics were definitely even more amazing. I'd actually say this is possibly the best looking gen 8 game yet.  So, speaking of gameplay....it was as engaging and fun as ever. Really, I could run and drive around Kyrat all day every day and never be disappointed. There is a ton of stuff to do, plenty of objects to find, all of which carrying their own piece of a few different stories. The flight suit was also super cool.  Troy Baker as Pagan Min was inspired. I don't know that anybody could ever top Vaas as a video game villain, but Pagan Min was right up there, and Baker played the role to perfection. There were quite a few interesting characters in the game, but Min really stole the show.  As always, your moral choices tend to be more of the best of the worst type things. You won't really feel great about either story arc at times (there are basically two, much like with FC3). Neither really represents a ""good guy"" type scenario. Lesser of two evils kind of deal here. That said, there is a little leeway. In my playthrough, where possible, I let people live. Sometimes, that doesnt even work out well, lol.  Anyway, the story was pretty engaging IMO. It won't win any prizes necessarily, but it does keep you interested and wanting more.  Did I mention the elephants? Holy ##### the elephants! They are complete bad ###es, and you will defintiely want to take full advantage of your ability to ride one into an enemy outpost and wreak havoc. In fact, the first outpost I attacked, they had an elephant penned. I shot the elephant in the behind with an arrow from afar, and it basically went beserk and took care of the entire outpost for me while I watched the whole thing through my binoculars, lol.  Did I mention the Rhinos? F### the rhinos. They are also bad ###es, and they don't really discriminate, lol. Everybody in the area is a potential target for their ill temper and rage. They are also incredibly resilient. You will waste a ton of bullets trying to take one down. Also, once they figure out that you are the one shooting at them, they definitely don't hesitate to let you know just how little they appreciated that treatment. At one point, I literally just fired a grenade launcher at an enemy courier when a rhino came out of nowhere and smashed the courier. Just then, a rebel truck and an enemy truck both rolled in and everything started attacking everythign. As I watched in amazement, and eagle swooped in and attacked me. After I fought off the eagle, looked over and gazed upon the smoking ruins that was several vehicles and a bunch of once living people, with a rhino sauntering off looking pleased with itself, I thought ""You know, this is what Far Cry is all about right here"".  btw....eagles....by far the most annoying and vicious creatures in a game that also features honey badger, rhinos, elephants, and so on. They move fast, they can come from any direction, are huge and can carry off smaller prey (like goats...which you will see happen), and view everything as prey. F### those eagles, lol.  I'm sure you can tell from reading all of this that there is a lot of content and a lot of randomness in this game, which really adds to the experience.

Which I asked him if it was OK if I could borrow his copy of the Twilight Princess. So he and I settled on a borrowing agreement he took one of my games to borrow and I took one of his games to borrow. Which in that case meant we would return the games we borrowed from each other (Its like renting a game from a video store only I was borrowing it from a friend and there was no late fee plus I am agreeing on a handshake to return his property in the same condition he gave it to me and if theres any damage I pay for it.) So I took the game home, tried it out and I immediately was immersed and in total love with the game. This game is by far one of the best Legend of Zelda games I have ever played.

The Poe Soul Side quest however is the hardest side quest because there is over 60 Poe Souls.  Because what I find difficult about the Poe Souls is a.) there locations b.) Knowing when you got them and not going back to the same location twice when I was already there. So yeah that's why I took one star off for that particular side quest because the locations for all the Poe souls can be confusing and I kind of wish that Nintendo would have lessened the amount of Poe souls and dropped it down to like 30 or 40. 60 is way too many for me to handle. But otherwise I love the darker atmosphere the bosses, the storyline and the graphics and my favorite part of the game is the Master Sword.

This would be great if it worked - but more often than not it is off just enough to drive you completely insane.

You would think the game could easily pick out those beats. But NO! It was pretty close but most of the time it was off just enough to bug you completely. Sometimes it would get the half beat. Sometimes it was just off the main beat.  It got to the point that I would dance along to the music and accept the ""poor"" ratings just to have fun. It was more frustrating than anything else to dance off beat to try to hit the arrows.  Also there'd be a nice strong obvious part of the song that had no steps at all - and then a bridge or something with hardly any playing that would have a lot of steps. It just made no sense.

917,150728,3,True,"07 6, 2010",AOYGPHW4YMYEO,B0010AYJXI,Shaide,"The game was fair but slightly ruined by poor controls. However, I do want to clarify now that, while the controls did take a bit of getting used to, once you were used to them, they were quite easy and comfortable, and to be honest, I can't imagine playing the game any other way. So, the controls were great, graphics and sound was superb, the acting was wonderful and the story was enjoyable. Overall I would have to say Alan Wake was a pleasurable experience.  Although, pleasurable as it might be, it was far from perfect! I've given you the pluses, now it's time for the negatives.  To begin with, the game felt like a long playable commercial for energizer and Verizon. I think I saw ""Energizer"" more times than I saw and heard the name ""Alan Wake"". Perhaps they should have just called the game ""And going...and going...""? I am seriously surprised that at some point the energizer bunny didn't come beating his drum across the screen.  Next, the game is way too short! The game is divided into 6 ""Episodes"" which is basically 6 levels. each episode can be finished anywhere between 1 to 2 hours, depending on how hard-core you are playing and how throughly you are investigating the locals. However, what this means is, you could in theory beat the game in about 7 or 8 hours. Now, normally that's not a huge thing, since most games feature an Online play mode, however Alan Wake doesn't offer any online play. Your gaming experience is just those 6 episodes. Although more ""Episodes"" will be arriving soon in the form of downloadable content(More on this later)  Another thing I dislike about the game, is that many of the ""Action"" segments take place in the woods. Now during the first 2 ""Episodes"", that was kind of cool! The woods are a scary, and creepy and offer plenty of places for monsters to hide. After awhile though? Come on! It gets old! There's only so much running around trees a person can do before they start to lose interest! Once they get bored of the same repeating settings, then they are going to start getting bored of the game!  The next negative? Well, that would be the ending! Now, I am not going to include any spoilers for anyone, but what I am going to say is that the ending is lame. It's one of the worst game endings ever. It doesn't even seem like an ending at all really! There's so much just left hanging and in the air, and what little excuse of an ending there is just leaves you scratching your head dumbfounded.  Now, granted! Maybe the ending wasn't really an ending, but instead left open to leave room for the downloadable content. Maybe the ""Huh?! Factor"" will be resolved with the coming episodes. Possibly. However, I feel that it's kind of a rip off. Like they sent out an unfinished product, expecting you to pay the amount that one would pay for a full length game, and instead they receive an unfinished game, and a code to get the next episode free, however the second DLC you are of course expected to buy. In essence, you have to pay AGAIN to finish the storyline that SHOULD have been finished in the final product! It's ridiculous! It's like they are trying to milk you out of more money than their game title is actually worth.  Yes, I know other companies have DLC as well, and to be honest, some of them I think are ridiculous, for instance the modern warfare DLC map package. However, some companies like Rockstar actually provide QUALITY DLC items! For instance Grand Theft Auto IV actually finished! It had an ending, then they released 2 other DLC packs that contained whole new storylines, that were connected to the first, but could be played separately and enjoyed and felt that you had a quality gaming experience with an actual ending.  Would I recommend the game? I would recommend renting it. Like I said, it's a pleasurable game, but it's also a quick game! You probably will finish it during a rental period and most likely won't have a need to replay it since there's no real online play to extend the replay value.",Decent game with many pluses and negatives.,1278374400,,,,clarify maybe i've dislike ever say factor wood hear spoiler resolve actually room time get length many thing dlc later possibly monster really beat control point far try yes soon replay kind creepy hide bit across rent separately screen would actual leave include sound released experience hang superb run enjoy saw overall anywhere finish alan playable call wake expect going...and lose surprise know rip episode negative plus much person amount theory lame like value scary graphic divide could come dumbfound investigate might tree product connect open segment downloadable title normally can't enjoyable modern name instance storyline hard-core unfinished money long content(more finish repeat one package new ruin whole huh leave likely worth first item awhile time game imagine auto buy game felt also arrive play since map story old though energizer there's give second code local play head end however recommend hour interest need receive think next excuse poor anyone take slightly scratch mean although left huge bad little course theft offer quality place pack act seriously free quick online use beat game perhaps level provide start period plenty form ridiculous send pleasurable episode come wonderful warfare ending setting well expect say another get final air quite milk way feature depend pay grant verizon perfect action mode company rental great drum storyline feel real begin iv place that's play go probably comfortable commercial rockstar want full cool fair extend honest throughly even essence easy basically short grand around contain instead seem content bored negative bunny get

(1) when you're assigned to patrol a area in order to get credit for having accomplished it you have to stay within 50 miles of the marker for 48 hours. Now how are you supposed to hunt enemy shipping when you're anchored to a small area? It's annoying but not a big deal.  (2) Air attacks. I think UBI went wayyyy overboard on this! A example; On my last American patrol, in May 1942 I was attacked 5-6 times daily from northwest of Midway all the way to Japan! A distance of at least 2500 miles. Now in order to cover that much area with enough aircraft to make that possible it would require THOUSANDS of planes just dedicated to anti-submarine duty! No nation on earth, then or now, could do that. I know 2 WWII sub vets and they've told me that one plane a day within 500 miles of Jap bases was average, sometimes not even that ofton. The endless air attacks do NOT make the game exciting. It's exasperating to get attacked by planes every 2-3 hours gametime especially when you're over 1000 miles from the nearest enemy base.  (3) The game did NOT have a manual. I had to ask many questions on the Silent Hunter 4 forums (Thanks folks!) for a lot of info about gameplay.  It's a great game when you're not crash diving out from under the endless air attacks. That's the only downside to this game.

I've played every one of them (except ""The Run"") since the original Shift that was released in 2009.  I really enjoyed Shift, Hot Pursuit, and Shift 2.  I've dropped hundreds of hours into those games on both PS3 and PC.  18 months ago or so I picked up Most Wanted on PC for $5 via a Microsoft store Christmas sale.  So what did I think?  Well, it depends really.  I like parts of it - the environment is great, the graphics are great.  Everything looks amazing and I'm able to run it on high settings with my 650Ti graphics card.  I like the idea behind the game, too.  There are 12 drivers around the city.  You gain speed points by winning races.  The more speed points you accrue, the more Most Wanted racers you can take on.  Cars are scattered across the city and you can run the same races in different cars.  All this is well and good.  I also like that Most Wanted incorporates some elements of Burnout - billboards and gates to crash through, drive-through repair shops, open world driving.  I'm glad those elements have returned.  Sometimes you just want to drive around and enjoy the sights.  What I really didn't like was the overwhelming police presence in this game.  Sometimes I would just like to complete a race without having to escape the police once the race the was over.  It's pretty obnoxious, really.  The races are challenging enough without having to spend another 3-5 minutes trying to escape the police after its over.  I suppose you're one of the ""Most Wanted,"" so I get it to a certain degree, but I'd just like to compete in some races without having to deal with the police, who, incidentally, are EXPERT drivers and can perfectly execute a pit maneuver while drifting around a corner at 150 MPH.

This review focuses on the one item exclusive to the Survival Edition, the PipBoy Clock. The clock is a poor product, plain and simple, and not worth $10 extra, much less the $50 over the Collector's Edition price.  Performance is terrible. The clock doesn't work unless you use some redneck engineering on it with aluminum foil inserts placed between the positive battery point and the positive contact plate. Once you get the batteries in and actually get power to the display, setting the time can itself is cumbersome. The three buttons provided are often times unresponsive, requiring a good deal of wiggling at times to get the display to change as desired. The display, even with fresh batteries, is very dim, very hard to interpret unless the room it's in is very dark.  In terms of power consumption, it devours batteries, consuming three AA batteries every two weeks, sometimes sooner. In comparison, the old one-way pager I carry for my job, which has an alarm, storage for phone numbers and time received, and makes some rudimentary sounds if desired, uses one AAA battery every MONTH or so. This clock doesn't even have an alarm, and uses much more power for it.  Aesthetically, the clock is a mixed bag. The overall design and look match the Fallout universe exactly. My example, however, arrived unpainted, looking nothing like I expected it to look. I know the technology and ""look and feel"" of the game series is ""used retro science fiction"", but this clock is as drab as drab gets, with no logos or anything to maintain that sense of having something form the Fallout world, even if it's a fake. Further, the clock was at one point supposed to be wearable like the PipBoy used in the game. That too, has been nullified by poor craftsmanship.  Furthermore, the level of customer service provided for this clock from amazon.com and Bethesda SoftWorks, the game's license holder, is incredibly underwhelming. For one, in order to get any warranty work done on it, you must send in money, and the clock, to some company in California that no one's ever heard of. So for yet more money you lose possession of a broken clock that originally only cost you $50.

This game isn't perfect, but none are, and it won't appeal to everyone. It is very realistic in its approach to combat, no crosshairs, weapon malfunctions, realistic load times and procedures, all great. The variety of weapons is nice, as are the possible uses.  A small note on weapon malfunctions and jams. You will often get weapon malfunctions when using enemy pick ups. I have seen it described as being unrealistic that an AK would jam, malfunction or destroy themselves after a few hundred round. Many of the weapons used by such groups in Africa have been used, carried, and abused for years and many thousands of rounds already. I have seen a large number of bent, broken and otherwise unhealthy small arms in several African counties. AKs, G3s, and FALs are amazingly rugged and reliable weapons but they are machines and with too much use and abuse they do fail.  The physics are quite nice, and its really nice to watch a fire you start burn its way across the plains. The shadows and lighting is great, but can be distracting. It is often times hard to find enemies shooting at you with the huge amount of shadows drifting about. Which again is fairly realistic, but will annoy players who are use to having little red dots to tell them where to shoot. The detail on the weapons themselves is also nice, though the designers have mirrored several of the models. I think they did this to add more detail and action to the weapons themselves. All of the weapons in the game have their bolts on the right and would eject that way. Not a bit deal but something that takes away from the illusion, at least for me.  The enemies are normally pretty smart (annoyingly so at times) and will try to take advantage of numbers and flanking, and usually even cover. Its not perfect but they offer a challenge, though a number of them seem to have eagle vision and have gone to several sniper schools before returning home to Africa to fight. By which I mean they are very good at hitting you with rifle fire from several hundred yards away, through cover and while running. The enemies in technicals also have an annoying habit of creeping up on you before unloading a light machine gun into your back.  There are two things that very much take away from the game in my opinion. The vehicles are a bit annoying but needed, driving is handled poorly and its hard to see where you are going often. A lot of the missions seems to require you to get in your car, drive across four maps, hit your target and then come back. During that trip though you will constantly be under fire from every person in the whole area. Every check point, every dock, every road, random people will be there to shoot at you. When you factor in the enemies ability to make remarkable shots and take massive amounts of damage, its gets old fast. The difficult levels are pretty out of whack. Easy may mean it is the easiest setting in this game, but it by means easy to play through. The story is rather lacking, though realistic, its sparse. Which suits the game well enough.  Another annoyance is that you contract malaria as soon as the game begins. Why anyone would go to Africa without getting their Doxycycline out of the way first is dumb. Your main character could also be in a bit better shape, getting blurry eyed and wheezy after even a short sprint. I suppose this can be forgiven since he apparently does have malaria after all. Small gripes for me but ones I am willing to live with.  I recommend this game as a rental, but if you turn out to enjoy it and not mind the short comings then pick it up. There is nothing worse than to drop your hard earned cash on a game to find it annoys you to no end. Plenty of shooting, burning and explosions, how could you go wrong? Be sure you are willing to deal with the annoyances and often dying.  (UPDATE) After several days of play I have to say I am getting utterly sick of the totally tedious nature of this game. The endless amounts of driving to get a mission done, just to drive across the entire map again and get another one is unnecessary. It is true there is a 'bus system' but you still have to travel from the stations to your targets. Add to this fact that from getting your mission and getting to your target sight you will get in at least five gun fights is ridiculous. Then when this is added to the save system and the rebels later heavy armament, you waste a huge amount of time to accomplish nothing. I have to move my recommendation to a rental on this one, if at all.

Console:  The console is the black elite (matte) color with a nice gray accent on the top, some small gray graphics and lettering on the face plate, and a large ""2"" on the bottom (or left side if your stand yours up).  One thing I liked is the removal of the chrome disc tray for a solid black one.  The console looks really clean and nice, not overwhelming like the Halo console, or retina burning Resident Evil 5 console.  Accessories:  This is what makes the package such a bargain, while it still lacks an HDMI cable, it makes up for with a nice list of other stuff.

951,292166,3,False,"09 14, 2014",A3C2DVW6GCESYJ,B00BGA9Y3W,Carl Ward,"My first review consisted of me trying to understand the reasoning behind their newest IP, Destiny and what the consumer should expect when playing it. Well after playing more and more of Destiny, I am here to rewrite my review on the point of view of what the consumer would want and what they will see after getting further into the game. I will cover player versus player and player versus enemy in this review as well. So without further wait, my newest review to Destiny!  First Impressions: I won't lie to you that as somebody who plays video games, that I liked what I saw out of Destiny when I played the beta. My opinion of the game hadn't wavered even after the initial launch of the game. You start out by creating a character comprised of race, gender and class and level him/her up to twenty by fighting the forces of the antagonist, The Darkness. While each planet (a total of four mission-filled planets, earth, moon, venus and mars) has only a handful of story missions, an exploration-type mission, and larger instances that vary in type (strikes and raids). The strikes are miniature raids which you ""might"" get something good out of it. Raids on the other hand are much larger and can be difficult. Overall, I was generally impressed that it actually WORKED as a game and suffered so little problems. Even on my measily little 5mpbs connection do I stay connected without fail. But there ARE times in which I will have a few problems, but not much.  Second Impressions: At the moment you get to level 20 (the maximum base character level), is when the real game begins. Well, we are TOLD this, but this isn't actually the truth. You will be doing strike after strike after raid after raid after heroic story after heroic story and so on just for the purpose of accumulating gear that will get you to the real level cap of 30. The truth of the matter is that you will be doing the same stuff all the time to accumulate marks and reputation so you can obtain this gear in the shops, provided you have no interest in what you may find in the line of exotics and legendaries. The game doesn't even become rewarding all that much, even as you play through the higher level of strike missions, which should be the case. We should be awarded gear and go exploring to find better gear. Or this is what I've always been told how it works in normal games. The game WANTS to be an MMORPG, but if anything, it can't live up to what you'd expect out of a success like World of Warcraft, even in it's earliest of years. And if you have a real life, this means that you will be begging your friends to team up with you so you can get X mission done, because they're all raiding. In the end, the game isn't very forgiving in the way of progress. This is especially true as most of the game does NOT offer matchmaking, so this means that you will definitely need people who will want to play the game with you.  Player Versus Player: The first thing to know is that participation means nothing in Destiny's PVP modes and neither does winning. You'd think that being in a team actually means SOMETHING, but alas, this is NOT the case. The ONLY thing that unfortunately matters is getting kills in, which to me kind've stinks something fierce. The game practically hates people who are new at the whole PVP deal, so unless you can adapt and learn to become better, then you may as well not bother with PVP at all. What bothers me more is that Bungie claims the game is the biggest game that they've actually developed, but I think I'd like to see proof of that.  Final Thoughts: If you have a game that you are doing the peepee dance to play when it gets released, then go for it. While Destiny IS an exciting game, there ARE better choices available for you, as the consumer. I hate to say it, but understanding the developer just isn't enough now adays, knowing why Bungie isn't up to par will not make me feel any better and it won't make the game any better. But I will say that as a game, it is worth playing later on after it has been patched.","Worth it later on, but not right now.",1410652800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,player proof force i've understand fight earth reputation actually time problem get thing expect later exotics reason pvp peepee mode comprise neither enemy ip success point try large accumulate type stuff high strike would bungie explore raid practically choice work forgive difficult release saw overall stink race without wavered stay go hate tell do they're may dance developed review know much view base fierce they've create antagonist patch like consist thought level four character might handful connected matter beta strike normal can't nothing gender wait claim definitely obtain well unfortunately friends rewrite new instance mmorpg whole worth become first miniature time hate game see year mission destiny accumulate big vary case bother kind've moment play story behind mission-filled always begin second launch play hand fail mission true generally planets interest need maximum think want enough i'd adays initial mean know measily play little consumer like offer deal raid par good participation team game award truth legendaries win impression start versus suffer provided make reward destiny's planet beg life well say get final unless him/her find gear way warcraft ala connection world impress video twenty developer exploration-type mar heroic something somebody feel real early line lie play matchmaking live adapt venus work shop want raid learn kill especially excite mark even matter cap opinion purpose moon class darkness total progress cover end people bother available get new anything understand

I had been browsing the PSP catalogue trying to find a few cheap titles and came across this one which seems to have great reviews across the board. While I can't say that I've played very many tower defense type titles in the past (I generally play RPG/SRPG and Simulation games)  I can say that without a doubt this game is now a top favorite of mine.  The objective is simple. Keep the monsters from making it across the field to your hut using strategically placed defense towers. All towers cost a portion of gold, which you collect by killing monsters. Some more powerful towers are unavailable until you unlock them with gems, which also come from killing monsters. There are obviously some more mechanics at play which are also pretty straight forward. What makes it so addictive is trying to get a perfect score on every level- because in most cases you can breeze through pretty easily getting an 18-19 (20 is perfect). Sometimes you can play through what seems like a very long and stressful round and just when it seems you've got it wrapped up some little monster miraculously makes it through all of your defenses with a sliver of health and takes one of your potato babies.

955,289267,5,False,"04 18, 2015",A3E2MOGHVWK51Q,B00BFOEY3Y,DON,"I'll start by saying I own every single premium Logitech mouse worth a second look, including the MX Revolution, Anywhere MX, and Performance MX, to the newest MX Master. While I'm not an expert, I know what I works and feels comfortable for an average-sized guy with a 9.5-inch sized great span of a right hand. It's at about this point I tell anyone still pining for a return of the MX Revolution to just let it go and move on. Logitech caught lightning in a bottle with that one and it doesn't appear to ever be happening again. It's almost impossible to find a new one online (because who buys a used mouse?), not to mention even if you do find a new one, the prices are going to be ridiculous. That said, the Anywhere MX is really a travel-sized mouse and too small to use regularly and still be comfortable. That and Logitech recently cheapened the hell out of it by changing it from a matte finish to this new gloss finish that not only feels and looks low-rent, but also is physically uncomfortable to touch and enhances perspiration. Finally, the Performance MX is pretty good attempt at a copy of the Revolution, but with less feature content. It's a good size and does have a few customizable buttons, but lacks a second scroll wheel. In its defense, however, the Performance MX can be had at a rather inexpensive price point, especially now that the Master MX is out. Nevertheless, I say just spend your time and money on a more worthwhile pursuit and get the G700S.  Even if you don't game, the G700S is the way to go for a few reasons. While the new Master MX does have a second thumb-positioned scroll wheel, it's not adjustable and scrolls freely. That, combined with the wheel's small size, actually makes it a bit difficult to use precisely and often moves inadvertently because of its placement. Granted it's shape is very comfortable and looks are no doubt premium, the Master MX really has few other notable personalization options for practical use. What the G700S lacks in a second scrolling wheel, it makes up for in programmable buttons. The size of the G700S should work for most people, and the sheer amount of programmable buttons makes this thing very convenient even for the non-gamer. The DPI switching alone makes it worthwhile for anyone who edits music or pictures with any frequency. Program the rest for media keys or something like that and you'll never reach for the top row of keys on your keyboard again.  My only real issues with the G700S are the kind of dorky graphics they put on the palm rest and button areas, but at least its in a sort of not-too-disruptive, monochromatic scheme. The other ""real"" issue is the battery life, which is dreadful and inexcusable when compared to the other Logitech offerings. I'm not exaggerating either; I'm saying this will not last longer on a single charge than two or three days of moderate use... even less if you're really going at it.

956,283737,2,True,"12 19, 2016",AC18Z05A976FC,B00AAS888S,review65163,"Starting with the positives. The ergonomics are really nice, especially if your hands are on the larger side. Mine aren't, so I had difficulty reaching the topmost side button with my pointer finger. That's not a strike against the mouse, so much as my small, Trump-like appendages.  On to the criticisms. The bottom button started sticking almost immediately after I started using it (like within a week of light use). The build quality seems good on the outside (sturdy plastic shell and strong braided cable) but the internal mechanisms that control the actual buttons could definitely use another round of QA.  Second gripe: Razer Synapse and no on-board memory for saving button configurations, DPI, or light settings. You have to leave Razer's Synapse bloatware running in the background at all times, or your custom settings and button mapping won't work. The software itself is extremely bare bones, and doesn't offer much in the way of customization. The memory requirements and startup speed of the app are trivial, but as a gamer, it's more the principle of having yet another needless processes squatting in the background that really irritates me. Doubly so because Synapse REQUIRES signing up for an utterly pointless Razer account before you can even use the mouse, which is yet another layer of log-ins and DRM that stand in the way between you and your gaming.  In summary: Your mileage will vary with respect to the build quality issues, plenty of people have had no issues even after years of use. I wasn't so lucky. How annoying you find account-based DRM baked into your hardware will also vary. I'm obviously not a fan, but once you get it set up you'll probably be able to ignore it safely (assuming their servers stay on).  Personally, I'm going to recommend picking up a Logitech G502 instead. Similar price if you shop around, more functionality, better software, and on-board profile saving.","Great ergonomics, mediocre build quality, pointless software DRM.",1482105600,,{'Style:': ' DeathAdder Essential'},,second mapping nice finger plastic irritates much use find shop work small app button way utterly save extremely trivial like process immediately mechanisms recommend require round could start custom week time qa lucky software get assume reach sturdy within drm button seem stick definitely sign hand cable braid mine bone gripe principle obviously well really doubly that's needle offer personally quality annoy memory configuration summary account razer mileage functionality server similar large able go gamer good speed positive razer's probably outside safely price log-ins bake light almost strike synapse especially game difficulty pointer actual mouse background profile issue topmost also dpi fan pointless even requirement leave shell plenty bloatware bottom pick year side vary ergonomics build run i'm around logitech set yet layer trump-like instead customization bare startup stay people respect setting criticism use account-based hardware squat another strong internal ignore start on-board appendage control stand
957,190251,4,True,"06 9, 2010",A7HDIBPWU66SR,B00269DX5W,new Tron,"Two qualities really stand out when I think about my experience playing through Assassin's Creed II.  First off, it is an absolutely beautiful game.  And secondly, it was EXTREMELY fun to play.  Right off the bat, this game was visually breathtaking.  You begin the main part of the gameplay in Renaissance-era Florence, Italy and all your surroundings are just bursting with energy and detail.  Ubisoft did a great job recreating this time and place and bringing it to life.  From the small gardens behind the homes on busy city streets, to the dramatic vistas of the Tuscan hills from the tops of churches, it's a delight to look at.  The rest of the game is no different.  Venice, the other major metropolis, is wonderfully done with its ocean view vistas, architecture and canals.  Not only do the environments just look great, but they FEEL alive.  I was reminded of when I first put Grand Theft Auto: Vice City into my PS2 years ago, and was astounded how real Vice City felt.  This is how Florence and Venice feel here.  They are fully realized, incredible-looking, virtual worlds with lives of their own.  The environments make your character feel so small, like just another inhabitant of these bustling cities, and that in turn makes the gameplay feel so much more real and immersive.  The game was so fun as well, and this was enhanced by a solid set of controls.  Like seemingly all video games nowadays, they were tricky to get used to at first.  You don't realize it in the beginning, but you have the capability to exert a tremendous amount of control over your character.  Discovering those controls and mastering them as the game went on was a sheer joy.  As the story progressed, and as my character gained new weapons and abilities, at the same time my ability to control him grew, and my character's evolution felt very real to me.  Whereas in the beginning I would button-mash the X button to fight, by the end I was dodging, disarming, counterattacking, switching from fisticuffs to blades, and pulling off some stellar feats of execution, all in the same fight.  It was very satisfying.  Granted, the controls aren't perfect.  There are times, most noticeably when flying across the rooftops and scaling walls (one of the most fun aspects of this game, by the way), when the character would do something I didn't want him to do.  But these occurrences greatly decreased the longer I played, and near the end they barely happened at all.  That was the main thing that made this game so fun...the process of becoming a master assassin, both by advancing my character in the game, and by learning how to make him do what I want him to do from my end.  By the end, I felt invincible.  Aside from these qualities, the game also boasts some very good sound.  The score is minimal but effective and memorable.  There's a wide variety of side quests you can do that deviate from the main story.  The story itself was moody and grew more intriguing as the game progressed.  It was Dan Brown-ish in its religious-toned conspiracy narrative.  One of the game's side quests, where you search for a series of glyphs on important landmarks in order to unlock an important memory, served to enhance the story and mood greatly.  And lastly, the wide variety of methods to carry out your assassinations made sure there was never a dull moment.  From the large arsenal of weapons at your disposal (the hidden-in-the-wrist double blades are one of the coolest weapons in any video game ever) to the various methods you can dispose of enemies (ala throwing them off rooftops into the canals of Venice), it all just adds up to a very enjoyable experience.  You'll notice that although I gave this game 4.5 stars, I had to round down on the amazon scale due to a major weakness in this game, which was the economic system.  The major downside of this is that its just way too easy to get way too rich way too fast.  In the first 25% of the game, I really liked having to loot bodies, search for treasures, and perform various side quests in order to earn money and buy that upgraded piece of armor or new dagger that I wanted so bad.  But once you acquire your villa in the Tuscan countryside, and start collecting income on that, you basically become so rich, that there is nothing in the shops that you can't purchase without hesitation.  Unless you're a completist or a trophy hunter, there comes a point in the game where there really isn't any more motivation to try to earn any extra money.  This seems like it would be an easy fix in the next installment of the Assassins Creed games and I do hope that they address it.  Overall, Assassin's Creed II was awesome.  I had a really, really fun time playing it.

On the other hand, I have to agree with some intellingent reviews out there. What makes a portable gaming system good is just that, the gaming capabilities. That is why the Gameboy has been the must successfull gaming divice ever. It is a machine to play games, no more, no less.  The PSP is good at that (I repeat that I like it), but using the extra marketing hype (play MP3, Movies, etc), do not make it deserve, automatically like some kids think, 5 stars.  I listen MP3's with a player designed for that and then it is great.  I watch movies on a DVD player, which is just for that. (perhaps would use my laptop on a plane, but that is an exception)  And off course, I use my PS1, PS2, PSP, Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo, Supernintendo, GameCube, Dreamcast, XBox and even my atari 2600 and intellivision for playing GAMES, cause I bought them for that, ""to play games"". (Yes I have all of these systems).  I have never ever used them for anything else, since the ones that can play movies are not better than a DVD player, and the one that plays MP3s (PSP) is not better than my ipod (or should I?)  The PSP therefore deseves the full 4 stars for being such a good gaming machine, but never because it can do all other things.  If Sony and Nintendo (and MS for that matter) keep it simple and make gaming systems, then we surely will enjoy games much more. Let's let their engineers concentrate on Gaming Systems.

It puts the player in charge of managing hospitals. That sounds rather dry, but of all the hospital simulators, this one is the funniest--and the most fun. As the hospital administrator, you are given a hospital with pre-set walls, but you're free to set up rooms within those walls to be as big or as small as you can get away with. You hire doctors, janitors, and receptionists and set their pay as low as you can get away with, and try to have enough specialists to cure worryingly specific illnesses. In between fixing equipment that's getting a bit worn-out and racing against time to train enough doctors in whatever specialties you want them to have, you also have to research new advances. Oh, and you also have to make sure your hospital is clean and smooth-running enough to impress visiting VIPs and prevent hospital-borne epidemics, not to mention handle occasional earthquakes and influxes of epidemic/accident victims. As for the patients, you must also keep them comfortable while they're waiting for their various appointments--with soda machines, bathrooms, potted plants to look at, and radiators to keep them warm. Once a year you're evaluated and awarded cash prizes based on how well you did that previous year.  That sounds a lot like work, but what makes this game fun is the nature of these illnesses. Bloaty Head patients need to have a sharp pin jabbed in their heads to shrink them down. Elvis Impersonators need a psychiatrist's expert care to shed their delusion. Bald guys need a nice sit-down in what looks like a hairdresser's setting machine, while super-hairy people need a quick electrocution. Jellified people get solidly set. The noisome sufferers of The Squits need a quick drink from the nurse at the pharmacy to settle their insides. All the while, a perky British receptionist advises patients over the PA not to vomit in the corridors and to have their checkbooks ready. A mini-game pops up a few times wherein players must use various sorts of ranged weapons to shoot and kill rats in an empty hospital. Not sure what illness someone's suffering yet? Send them to the research room so they can be fed to a machine to analyze them better (and hope nobody official finds out about it). If you overwork your staff, they might just go loony, which is represented by skewed glasses or really wild hair. Not to be missed are the animations around the bathrooms--not only do you see the little straining faces and accompanying sound effects in the stalls, but you can also learn how many times this or that stall's been used. Little touches like these and many others make this game amazingly cool.  The mechanics of the game are not that hard to master, and the graphics hold up surprisingly well even in our modern day. There's nothing in this game that even children would find objectionable, nor anything that should offend any sensibilities--no cursing, sex, or violence. Even the bathroom stuff is pretty innocuous. For a game about diseases, Theme Hospital is quite a clean one. I'd recommend this game to anybody who enjoys simulators of this nature; it remains over a decade later one of the best of its genre.

986,49138,5,False,"02 24, 2005",A1250POFZL8U1B,B0000A0MDV,Plague11,"I picked up a copy of this game the day it came out (just two days ago) and I love it.  I will, however, admit that it does have its share of drawbacks, but there still isn't a racing game out there that can hold a candle to this one.  To begin, the graphics absolutely rock!  For as many cars and as many tracks as there are in this game, with as customizable and unique as so many of the cars are, I'm absolutely astounded.  It's one thing for a game that has, let's say 10-20 cars, to have rockin' graphics, but when a game has put such meticulous detail into each and every of the 600+ cars, you've got to be inspired (granted it did take them forever and a day to move from the previous sequel to this one).  The tracks are incredible and even include moving people.  That, in itself just blew my mind.  There is the addition of the ability to manage a racing team, which, I'll admit, I have yet to try, but I just bought the game two days ago, so I'm sure I'll get to it.  There's also the picture taking feature, another thing I have yet to explore.  That particular feature doesn't particularly appeal to me, but it's still a neat idea.  The level of customization has, again, been increased over its predecessor, although I question how much more can really be done.  The one thing I wish they had in this regard was the ability to repaint your car, but I can live with that.  And, lastly, for anyone who thought far enough ahead to save their GT3 data, you can transfer the A and B licenses, in addition to $100k to the new game.  This is definitely a bonus after having put into GT3.  Addressing some gripes:  First of all, no, your cars don't suffer damage, but this was intentionally left out.  In an interview with the creators/developers, the discussed how they had considered adding damage, but decided against it for a few reasons: 1-Most players (the developers and myself included) prefer not to drive damaged cars.  I'm sure most of you may disagree with this until you're blue in the face, but I'm just passing along the information.  2-Probably more importantly, although this game is supposed to be ""all about the realism"" as a driving simulator, the sheer amount of data added by including realistic damage, would certainly lead to processor lag time with the (now) limited hardware of the PS2.  And, to avoid having all damage and wrecks look exactly the same on all cars, different styles of crash damage would have to be added for each and every one of the hundreds of cars.  I would much rather have the developers focus on other, more important aspects of the game.  Nuff said.  Another complaint addresses the lack of Ferraris and other exotic cars.  This issue was addressed during the development of GT2 and 3.  It's the same reason that there weren't any Fords in the game, initially.  It's all about licensing issues.  Ferrari (and I assume Lamborghini, although the Lamborghini GT appeared in the Japanese release of GT3) would not sell the license to use the cars in the game.  Why?  Because Ferrari decided to contract out and develop their own game, which fell completely flat.  If Ferrari doesn't want their cars in this game, then I say to heck with em!  As for online play issues, I have yet to play the PS2 online, so that isn't of any concern to me either way.  So, in conclusion to all of my ramblings, is this game perfect?  No, not quite.  If some obstinent car companies would sign on (*cough-Ferrari-cough*) and, maybe, throw in a few more American cars (there are probably 2 or 3 to one as many Japanese cars as American) I would think that it was pretty darn close.  I would give this game 4.5 stars if I could, but I'll go with 5 since there seem to be so many nay-sayers.  It's simple, really: if you liked the previous installations of this game, you will like this one.","Still, by far, the best racing game out there!",1109203200,19.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,japanese nay-sayers importantly maybe come drive say player try wreck ferraris get many thing certainly reason sure different ability star really picture damage appeal pass far increase explore limited information would particularly track ago ahead include release em idea either two customization meticulous go hardware lag do every may wish give move realistic concern admit much amount think rock drive like sheer blew heck graphic level development could take installation question fell hold car rockin address definitely unique sell consider one conclusion manage love new added bonus forever appear day let's first licensing time cough-ferrari-cough damage issue game also still suppose racing license incredible pick initially intentionally since yet include there's data save exactly style realism creators/developers rather ford i'll use license however prefer think important anyone enough take regard although left simulator face like predecessor gripe american sign online add team ferrari exotic focus mind get particular close interview sequel buy lamborghini address avoid i'm car move along previous look assume say another hundred disagree nuff detail quite ramblings candle way darn feature complaint obstinent gt share astound customizable grant repaint perfect completely discussed company addition simple drawback processor begin address lastly put include play issue live developer reason develop probably transfer lack copy neat want decide crash blue even lead day aspect contract seem flat people inspire suffer throw absolutely pretty

In fact, that's the first line of its Amazon description. However, single-player is an exercise in futility. The prologue mission is fine, but after that, it becomes nearly impossible, if not *entirely* impossible. I've tried different characters. I've played for several hours. I've had the best success with Rath (a melee character) and have managed to level him up to Character Level 5 (which appears to be independent of the leveling progression during the mission). I've gotten to the point of *almost* beating the third boss in chapter one (presumably there is at least one more), but not quite. Each attempt takes 20 to 30 minutes, and with five lives until the game ends (I've earned more during the chapter, but only one or two, and I'm not sure what triggers that), I've started over and over again just trying to get through that first chapter.  It's clearly balanced for multiplayer. If any concessions were made for playing the game in single-player, it's hard to see. I hate rating the game low, but it did not meet expectations, especially considering that the single-player story mode is part of its marketing. I can't even tell if having Rath at level 5 has helped me push a little farther into the first chapter, or if it's just a matter of getting better at it over multiple attempts. At any rate, it's not what I expect from a single-player game. ""Hard"" is fine. I got the platinum in Bloodborne. Recently beat Dark Souls 3. I often play games on hard mode.

1009,77599,4,False,"12 4, 2010",A1B4VTD0FVD6OV,B000CQ75VY,D.G.M.,"I like this game a lot. It brings something new to the table for the Onimusha series, specifically much more in depth RPG elements and a MUCH longer and involved story. The gameplay is very similar to the previous games, but also adds new elements: some good, some not so good. This game takes place roughly 15 years after Onimusha 3: Demon Siege where Nobunaga's right hand man Tokichiro Kinoshita, now known as Hideyoshi Toyotomi, has ruled over Japan after his master's fall. Surprisingly, it was only recently that Hideyoshi started going mad with power and brought the genma back from exile to once again ravage the land. The main character is known as Soki (Oni of the Ash), who apparently has it in for Hideyoshi and wants to take him out. You also play as 4 other supporting characters who share the same sentiment: the new female Jubei Yagyu, the monk Tenkai Nankobo, the muscular priest Roberto Frois, and Soki's love interest Ohatsu. Exactly who all these new characters are and how they seemingly possess some sort of power relating to the Oni you'll have to find out for yourselves, but rest assured the connections they all have to certain legendary characters from the previous games will blow you away... or at least slightly impress you. Like I pointed out earlier, the RPG elements in this game go far beyond what they were in the first three in terms of leveling up your characters. For one thing, the characters ACTUALLY level up and this affects their melee attacks, magic attacks, weapons, and armor like in the first games, but to a greater degree. For example, you can equip items like rings and necklaces (you don't actually see them on your characters) to give your characters added benefits to defense, offense, and magic. They could also slowly replenish your health and magic over time. Soki is the character you start every level as, but you normally have one of the other characters to accompany you, and you usually (but not always) get to choose which one fights alongside you. Allies can be switched at save points and you can switch between Soki and his ally during combat with the push of a button. The D-Pad lets you issue one of four commands to your allies: stay put/block (which restores up to half of the ally's health), attack, go all-out (which increases rate of attack and decreases health) and special skill (varies with each character). Movement is now done solely through the analog stick, which is fine in this game since the camera is no longer in a fixed position and can be rotated by the player.  Since this game is split into episodic chapters, you'll spend lots of time between missions in hub-like hideouts where Soki can get to know his allies through optional dialogue which is displayed in text and actually makes for some entertaining reading for these moments of downtime. While in the hideouts you can also customize your characters and even revisit previous levels with different characters so you can reach certain areas that Soki cannot normally access on his own. Now for the game's combat: the basic elements are mostly unchanged, but the new added techniques and attacks you acquire as your characters level up keep the combat from getting stale and make better use of more numerous button combinations. The characters' fighting styles also differ greatly from one another in a similar manner to Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny. Soki is a balanced character who wields large swords, Jubei is speedy and wields smaller blades, Tenkai wields spears and staves that give him a longer reach, Roberto uses gauntlets that let him attack with close-range punches and jabs, and Ohatsu uses a variety of short-range and long-range firearms. They can all perform their own Oni awakenings as well, where they all become invulnerable and perform their own styles of powerful attacks (Soki is the only one who physically transforms into an Oni). Old and new genma enemies and bosses offer a decent (and at times unfair) challenge. The music has changed since the previous games as well, but fortunately the themes are mostly catchy and fit the overall tone of the levels and enemies. There are now less orchestral scores and many more pop, rock, and what sound like dance themes. There's even one theme that sounds like it's from Pirates of the Caribbean. As good as this game is, it does have a small number of noticeable issues. The cutscenes look good, but are bit on the grainy side in terms of resolution (except the CGI scenes, they're beautiful). The dialogue is unusually hammy at times, even for a Capcom game. When a cutscene occurs while the characters are in the hideouts, the in-game animations make their body movements and mannerisms appear greatly exaggerated and twitchy to the point where they appear like strung up marionettes being controlled by drunken puppet masters. Their mouths don't even move in these scenes, which is unacceptable to me in a PS2 game. Final complaint goes to the boss battles. Some are reasonably challenging, but others are unreasonably brutal, especially the last three bosses. Whether they're easy or hard, all the boss battles are long and drawn out since they all possess health bars longer than the 7 mile bridge. Even some regular enemies have this same annoyance. Despite these meager faults, this game is a lot of fun. With its emphasis on character customization and level exploration, this game lasts easily twice as long as the 3rd game, running between 20 to 30 hours (assuming you go through all the levels of the dark realm, which I could never do).

I'm writing a walkthrough for this game, so have been playing it pretty much non-stop since its release.  First, the gameplay. If you've been living in a cave and haven't heard of this game, it is definitely MATURE. The other two GTA3 games were mildly mature. This one is full blown mature. There is more swearing in 5 minutes of the game than in most full length R-rated movies. You are beating up people with baseball bats, having drive-by gang shootings, and more. This isn't a game for kids.  That being said, there is a lot here to entertain adults who are into gang life and rap music. The graphics are really quite amazing, and the maps are HUGE. You can drive all over intricately detailed streets, hopping in and out of whatever cars you see. There are different areas of town, each with its own look and feel.  The music immerses you in this world which is both bad and good. If you love the rap / hiphop music, you're all set. But unlike the other games that gave you a wide selection of music to choose from, in San Andreas you're pretty stuck with that one genre. I suppose there is one country station, plus the traditional (and fun) talk station too.  Gameplay is typical GTA style. You go on missions. In your missions you shoot the bad guys and go on object-finding hunts. There are tags to spray paint, people to talk to and deeds to do. A lot of blood is spilled along the way.  An addition to San Andreas is the customization of your character. You're a black male adult, and can go into barber shops to change your hairstyle at whim. You can also hop into a tattoo shop to add tats to various parts of your body. As you eat and run, you can get muscular, slim, fat or so on. If you eat too much and get fat, it slows you down. If you don't eat enough, you end up weak. Balance is key here.  The game is flying out of stores at an incredible rate, and the pre-orders for it were collossal. Loyal fans will not be disappointed - the game really amps up every aspect. Those who want to complain about the violence and language will find plenty to be upset about - but remember, this game is for adults only. It clearly says mature on the box. So if an adult chooses to play this game and have fun with it - well, that's their decision to make!",Amazingly good game - but pay attention to the MATURE rating,1099008000,19.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,tattoo black pre-orders stick clearly much muscular drive-by find drive quite shop intricately barber genre country way collossal swear wide say adult decision graphic shoot fly upset loyal add heard character adult traditional write guys world car aspect get map tat length hype hiphop station fat enough tag change paint definitely addition disappointed different minute amaze feel walkthrough non-stop movie blood fan amps suppose bat store music unlike huge box eat fun object-finding really hop cave rate theft one that's play san balance love lot whatever complain immerses spray gang good detail mildly hairstyle shop chooses male first spill beating game want full remember live various part language auto rap town bad game mature also streets talk key area weak gta see slow plenty deed release entertain violence mission whim baseball incredible kid make choose r-rated plus andreas hunt say play grand life i'm style since pretty set two along gameplay customization look typical life run end body hop slim people go well shootings every selection blow give

So I decided to get this for the 360 as my PC can't handle these games anymore.  I'll have to say I was a little disappoint.  But mostly because it didn't add much to the old games other than improved graphics and some new toys.  Maybe I set my bar too high.  Part of this is good.  They didn't fix what didn't need fixing!  The gameplay and action are just as good as ever.  The slow-mo deal is awesome!!  The MG and bazooka teams are way fun to play with and at the end of the game you actually get THREE squads to play with.  The bad: tank levels feel tacked on and personally too me out of the immersion.  MP looks bad, plays okay, and overall just feels tacked on as well.  And although the game looks great...not nearly as good as the E3 trailer we all saw a few years ago.  Overall, great game...but probably a rental for most.

1017,223950,4,True,"05 27, 2013",AV2QEVD6YF42H,B0048C7S5G,Hernany,"Let me start out by saying that I am a HUGE NASCAR fan. I play NASCAR 09 a ton because it was the only NASCAR game available. After seeing all the videos and all the hype surrounding this game, so far it's been a bit of a disappointment. The game needs major patches to fix issues. If the game didn't have so many glitches and silly mistakes, it could easily be a 4 star rating or an 8/10. Below are the pro's and con's after playing the game for 3 hours. For every pro, their is a con and usually the con is greater.  Pros: - Paint booth: It's cool to fully paint and customize your car. It's almost identical to Forza's system. - Attention to detail: The in-car camera is awesome. You actually see your drivers feet hit the clutch or put his foot on the brake. Also will move his hands to shift. If you drive as Dale Jr you can see his driving gloves are black Adidas. - The pre race introduction is cool. Announcers talk about the track, fireworks go off, fly overs, etc.. - The menu: I find this to be really cool. People walking around outside, your crew working on the car, and it's easy to navigate. When selecting tracks it shows like a pit pass with stats which is cool. - Gameplay: The cars are sensitive and don't require to much steering wheel input. Cars feel solid and drive like a 3,500lb+ car. Physics are pretty good. - Drafting: Finally other cars will work with you and push you - Pit stops: Animations are really cool. To see the lug nuts fall off and gas spill out is neat. - Setups: You can tune your car as much or as little as you like. Perfect for the simulation or arcade driver. - Pace car: Under caution its cool to see an actual pace car  Cons: - Paint booth: Making your own decals and stuff is cool, but the controls can be clunky. NASCAR 09 did it right by having an online feature and then import it to you game. Would be much easier to make cool designs instead of something a 2nd grader did with crayons. - Attention to detail: Things like the caution lights being on while the race is under green is silly. Also if you spin through the infield and end up on pit road you get black flagged for speeding. - Damage: Even after flipping over and hitting cars head on, my car looks like I hit a deer instead of another car at 190mph - Race modes: If you want to practice you have to go to a separate session from the main menu. No other cars are out there with you. If you choose to race, you get to qualify and then race. Can't even change your setup in between. - Hitting the wall is a joke. Your car basically just comes to a stop. You don't smash into it and then your car spins out of control. If you drive through the grass your car doesnt spin out. - Cautions: This is even more a joke. I spun out, 10 cars hit me, and no caution. I had to drive in reverse for about 10 seconds before it came out. If you spin by yourself it still won't come out even if you wreck hard. - No DNF's: You can destroy your car as much as you want, drive with full tape on the grille, and nothing happens. Maybe you lose a little performance but that's it. - Pit stops: It's great to have the animation but having to wait 10 seconds for it to load kinda kills it. Also if your under caution, the game should ask you what you want to adjust well before getting on pit road. - Online: One word....horrible. If you try to bump draft you wreck basically. And if the caution flag actually does come out, the crashed car has to sorta drive back to start finish line from this over head blimp camera. One time I just stared at a stopped car on the back stretch for 5 minutes. Then when we were about to start the race, cars started flipping and spinning. Online is useless until they fix it. - Career mode: It's basically just a season mode. Go to the race, race it, and move on. How come games like MLB 11 The Show can have ticket prices, free agents, stadium upgrades, trades, sponsors for the stadium, etc etc and we get a season mode? A real career mode would feature hiring a pit crew, buying a shop, building chassis for different tracks, hiring more drivers to make a full race car team (like Richard Childress Racing), engine shop and engine builders. When you race you should earn money and that money should be used to buy better crew chiefs, better products, larger shop building, bigger sponsors, higher expectations, etc etc. Have an off-season where you can test at tracks to improve your car and team or public events to gain fans and impress sponsors. A merchandise section where you can sell die-casts, memorabilia, shirts, etc etc to earn money and gain fame. Would be cool to start out as a rookie in a 1 car team and over a season or 2 be a major powerhouse and have a full 4 car team. - Wrong paint schemes: I know a patch is scheduled to update the roster and paint schemes, but seriously, why make a game with last years schemes and cars? It would be like MLB 11 The Show releasing the game with players on last years teams. Every sport releases their game around the start of the season with current rosters, NASCAR should too. Over the course of the season, have patches and downloads for new car skins or if drivers get dropped or a new driver starts. - Night races: Another head scratcher. I am racing at Charlotte and it's dusk the entire time. There are no day to night transitions. Either have the race in the day or at night, not in between. - HUD: I don't want to see how many experience points I am getting for ""Dominating."" I also don't want car radar which is a small icon at the bottom of your screen showing where cars are around you. Actually, this might be a PRO since you have no rear view mirror and can't tell where anyone is unless you look behind you which usually isn't a good idea while doing 180mph around a turn. - Spotter: It's great that he can inform me to drink tons of fluids cause its hot, but it sucks when he cant tell me there is a car low. As soon as a car comes low or high, spotter should tell you that. I don't care that I'm leading and can do this all day, I care if a car is coming up on me or I'm approaching lap traffic. Maybe he got himself a cold beverage and missed all the cars around me. - Difficulty: Even on VERY HARD the game isn't very hard. Very hard would be riding in 20th position fighting for 19th. Very hard is being at Daytona or Talladega and being stuck in middle of the pack cause there is no where to go all by yourself. I raced at Charlotte and after 10 laps I had almost a 3 second lead. Then all of a sudden by lap 13 the field was right behind me. If my tires went away in 10 laps or the AI just got amazing, that's pretty stupid.  As you can see, a lot of issues. For their 1st time out the game is playable, but only to a certain degree. If you want online, skip this game until a patch is released. I am going to stick to single player until the new car paint schemes come out and the game is fixed.

Looks like if you are a part of the dashboard beta program the beta caused an issue with this game. Changed my rating from one star to four. Game palys much like it did on 360. Great story and very tight gameplay with maybe a minor issue with the controlls being a little spongy, even with the sesitivity maxed out, but not enough to cause any control problems. Visuals have been upgraded but nothing jaw droping, but pretty non the less.

1023,53668,3,False,"08 29, 2013",A2EIOTAPIA4P3T,B0001DI6FM,Guanacosine,"When it comes to games based on a movie series, things are typically hit-or-miss. Star Wars games tend to work better because the lore lends itself to great things, but it also takes a solidly built game to be worthwhile despite subject matter. Battlefront is a game the combines good subject matter with a solid but not great game mechanic.  There really isn't a plot or story to this game, which is fine. Clearly is wasn't built with that intention as it loosely follows how the six movies flow, using the story as just a backdrop with which to guide the gameplay.  The different game modes address most needs, with a 1v1 mode making players compete for control of the galaxy, an instant action mode to allow for quick, simple battles, and that's basically it. The second game would try to build on this to have a few successes but really add little to the table.  The gameplay is purported to be like two armies facing each other, but, in practice, it's you versus an army. A cursory glance at the statistics screen at the end of each battle shows that the player will eliminate somewhere between 40-60 enemies and the rank-and-file CPU will get less than ten. Maybe that's just realism, but, if you don't take the helm in each engagement, you'll be bound to lose. Instead of getting the feeling that you're a small part of a big army, it feels the other way around.  That said, it still feels nice to have so many people around. I'll walk into random rooms and see mini-fights going on, and that adds to the feeling of being on a battlefield. The AI's tend to be a little liberal with grenades, but this never became too much of an issue for me. The different classes do add some depth to the game, but you could easily just play as the basic infantry unit and not miss a thing. Sniping can be fun, but it's not easy. The anti-vehicle units feel pretty useless considering that vehicles don't really play into the gameplay. The game makes a big deal about the presence of AT-ATs in the battle at Hoth, but that's just a small part of the whole.  This is a game that does offer lots of replay value, and the situations you run into change somewhat frequently, so I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

1028,167278,4,False,"11 18, 2008",A67U5W2JZ1TP9,B001AWDFUY,Steven W. Johnston,"When i first heard the new James Bond game release was going to be built around the Call of Duty 4 engine, i've been waiting eagerly to get my hands on it.  Offline, it's an amazing game. This game jumps back and forth between the events of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The levels are very detailed. The enviroments are more destructible than Call of Duty 4, which definately adds to the full Bond expirence. Some levels have diverted dramatically from the movie. Such as La Chiffre's abduction by Obono includes the hotel being secured by his militia. I understand that between the two movies, they needed to expand for a better game expirence. Levels that were closer to the movie scenes were amazing. The sinking apartment in Venice couldn't have been pulled off any better, in my opinion. The game incorporates a third person view for around the corner shooting like in the Rainbow Six franchise. Another added feature that definately improves the gameplay. One feature i did not care for was the QTE events. Buttons flash on the screen, you must quickly respond or risk losing a hand to hand fight. Most QTE is done while in close quarters, and is up to the player how little or how much it's utilized. The boss sequences require the QTE system, but seems more entertaining than previous bond games with the generic helicopter or dual rocket launcher wielding soldier.  Sadly, one hindering factor in my opinion is the multiplayer. Not nearly as crisp as Call of Duty 4. You earn cash per round to purchase your choice of weapons, upgrades, and special abilities. I like the freedom of choosing what to get next, rather than suffering through several firearms and perks you could care less to ever use. Various modes seem like they were borrowed from the Metal Gear Online series, along with the classic free for all and team death match. Over all, characters look and feel clunky. The learning curve is harsh because of the buy-what-you-want system for more expirenced and aggressive players. Overall, i think the multiplayer was not polished over to make the release date.  PROS: -CoD4 Graphics engine -Great offline level designs -Levels chalk full of enemies to compete with a Bond movie body count -Added over the shoulder cam to fire around corners and blind fire is definately what CoD4 was lacking. -Most levels are very fast paced, adding to the Bond expirence  CONS: -Online Multi-player is definately lacking -The ""hacking"" sequence of unlocking doors gets rather old very fast -The gun selection seemed fairly small compared to previous Bond games -No real special bonuses after completion of the game such as unlocked guns -The final stage's high difficulty is ridiculously unbalanced from the rest of the game. -Fairly short. Game was beaten on medium difficulty within two (long) sessions.  Overall, i highly recommend this game offline. Honestly, a lot about this game reminds me of the original Goldeneye 64. The levels are extensive with tons of villians between you and the objective. The physics, destructible enviromets, and overall gameplay layout make you want to replay levels over and over again. EA could've spent more time on certain aspects, but compared to other movie based games rushed to coeincide with the theatrical release, this definately could have been much worse. DO NOT buy this game if you're looking for solid online multiplayer, very long first time through gameplay (such as RE4), or can't play a game again once you've beaten it.

For me most multiplayer is too fast and frantic, I prefer going at a bit slower pace. This game really stands out for two reasons: 1. because you can play slow and methodical, or go in guns a' blazing. 2. the single player gameplay feels just like the multiplayer, so it's easy to transition between the two without a learning curve. I played last night with friends and didn't have to ask them anything, the only question was where we wanted to go next and what approach to take. I also have to mention the map size, it's huge, and filled with quests and side missions, but not overwhelming. You decide when and where you want to go, you could play through the story missions, or just drive across the map, occasionally engaging in fights or side missions if you choose to. Gameplay: I find it very easy and forgiving, with smooth controls, gunplay feels realistic, and driving vehicles and piloting aircraft are simple to do. Character creator and weapons: Fantastic. You can go male or female, with lots of different outfits, and tons of upgradeable weapons. You can save different looks, but not different loadouts or multiple characters. Similiar to: Far Cry and The Division, which makes sense since they are also made by Ubisoft. Also Sniper Elite, Just Cause, and a bit of GTA. The not so great: 1. Adult themes. If you have kids, you may want to pass. A little sex, a lot of drugs, and f-bombs galore. 2. Lack of pop-in cover. You are basically limited to stand, crouch, lie down. Makes it difficult to take over a base as stealthily as I would prefer.

Though DOOM could stand out with the name alone as one of the series that helped define the genre, this game goes far beyond branding to sell itself. It raises the bar for violence, intensity, speed, brutality, and absurdity unlike any other game on the market right now. It doesn't need to rely on the big name. It reminds you why it's a big name in the first place.  This is one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had in a long time. This is DOOM for the modern era, succeeding in blending old school feel with cutting edge visuals and level design. Graphics are incredible, and performance is magnificent with a very steady 60fps. That, paired with extremely precise controls, make this game a dream to play.  If you're familiar with DOOM I and II, you'll have no problem settling in and crushing demons at a break neck pace. If all you know is DOOM 3, this is nothing like that. This is a whirlwind of blood, guts, and shotgun shells. Don't buy thinking you're getting a horror game.  As for the collector's items, the case is awesome with a nice, metallic finish with the lovely Revenant upon it. The statue stands a foot tall, and is every bit as detailed as the in-game model - a must have for every DOOM lover.

1031,101705,4,False,"05 6, 2008",A1UXN3087TVWRR,B000O64LJ6,M-Amzn,"Of course when this game first came out I thought it would be the greatest thing in the world being able to use the wiimote to cast spells such as the famous swish and flick (wingardiumleviosa). Well, turns out your just tilt the wiimote and nunchuck upwards, :).  The basic premesis of this game is you use the nunchuck to guide Harry around Hogwarts (obnoxiously followed by Ron and Hermione EVERYWHERE) and complete little tasks assigned to you. One of the more major ones is trying to get everybody from the DA in the Room of Requierement which requires you to find everybody on your map and do things for them so that they agree to go.  You also do little things around the school like find secret passages to shorten your trips from place to place (it REALLY helps), play wizard chess and marbles, put paintings back in place, fix statues, find animal prints, etc. all to get magical points to increace the power of your spells and various other bonuses.  The spells are like I said, the simple motion of the wiimote and/or nunchuck such as a circular motion, a tilt, a shake side to side, etc. It IS pretty cool though because it's certainly more realistic than pressing the 'A' button a controller.  This game is probably better for younger kids who like Harry Potter and like the idea of magic or scavenger hunts. It's definitely not something for a hard core gamer or an obsessive Harry Potter fan, because you WILL be dissapointed.  Overall, the cons are that the spells are a bit difficult sometimes, especially wingardiumleviosa because you have to tilt the nunchukc and wiimote together so that it works on screen and it can be difficult. Also, when you want to go somewhere on the map, you have to click on that place and then little footsteps on the floor will lead you around. This can be a bit difficult to follow because they don't appear consistently and sometimes you can't tell which way they're facing. Also, you actually have to walk from one end of the castle to the other which could take up to a minute or two in the real world, which is honestly kind of annoying.  Anyways, the real reason I personally like the game, is because I get a feeling of accomplishment when I complete like a list of tasks, and that's basically what this game is.

1032,148318,5,False,"06 3, 2009",A2FYURACEKVNA7,B000ZK7ZOE,D. C. Blanton,"inFAMOUS is a superhero game about a guy named Cole who wakes up in the rubble of a large blast that killed thousands. When he awakes, he realizes he now has incredible powers, allowing him to absorb and control electricity. Shortly after the blast, the government has quarantined the city, Empire City. Empire City is made up of 3 islands, and each one has now been taken over by a different gang. The Neon is controlled by the druggies the Reapears, the Warrens has been taken over by the homeless now calling themselves The Dust Men, and the Historic District has been taken over by a secret organization called The First Sons.  Early in the game Cole gets in contact with an FBI agent named Moya who gives him information and missions, and tells him that if he can find her husband John, who disappeared after the blast, and bring her the Ray Sphere, the bomb that caused Cole to get his powers, she can get him out of Empire City.  The game is an open world sandbox type game, allowing you take on missions as you see fit. Early in the game Cole doesn't have very many powers, but as you progress, you earn new powers by restoring power to the blacked out portions of the city.  Your basic attack, which also doesn't spend any of your energy, is a lightning shot or bolt that Cole fires from his hand as quickly as you can press the R1 button (also while holding L1 to aim). You'll also earn such powers as throwing electrical grenades, fire a rocket of elecrticity, summon a lightning storm, perform a sniper like precision shot, fire off a shock wave, and some others.  As you complete story missions and side missions, you earn XP. You also earn XP for killing bad guys, healing people, capturing bad guys, or draining enemies of their life. You spend this XP on upgrading your powers. The upgrades will be different depending on whether you want to be good or evil. Certain upgrades won't even become available until you've reached a certain level on your Karma, Cole's good and evil meter.  Early on in the game you need to decide whether you want to be good or bad. The game doesn't really allow you to be somewhere in between. Although you could, it wouldn't really benifit you much because you would never unlock the more powerful versions of your superpowers.  Throughout the game you'll be given the choice to do something good or bad. Early in the game the government has dropped some food crates into the city. You're given the choice to let the people in the city take the food, or you can be selfish and scare the people away and take the food for yourself and your girlfriend, Trish, and your best friend, Zeke. There are many more choices throughout the game similar to this.  One of the best things about this game is Cole's ability to scale buildings. Almost anything you see is climbable, allowing Cole to make his way up buildings and light poles and whatever else very easily and quickly. If you've played Assassins Creed, then you pretty much get the idea. I've had more fun scaling buildings in this game than I ever have in any of the Spiderman games.  Cole will also unlock the ability to slide along power lines and train tracks, and use static thrusters to glide, which adds even more fun and depth to traveling around the city.  The graphics in this game are good, but not great, but defiantly not terrible either. Unfortunetly the game suffers from some pop in, but this is easily forgiven due to the fact that the only load screen you'll ever see is when you first boot the game up. You'll also notice some jagged edges here and there. But the characters look great, especially Cole. Even more so when Cole becomes really evil, as his clothes become really dirty and grimy, and his skin turns pale.  The sound in this game is good, with all the proper special effects you'd expect to hear from someone who can shoot lightning from their hands. And the voice acting is really top notch too.  The cutscenes are a joy to watch as their told in comic book style, with added elements of 3D and movement.  As far as negatives, the game is a tad bit glitchy. Sometimes when Cole goes to restrain a villian or leech the life out of someone, he kinda gets stuck on something and jerks around for a moment before finally unfreezing from the spot. Also, in my time with the game, at one point an enemy threw a grenade at me and I somehow fell through the floor and to my death.  The other big annoyance is that Cole has very sticky fingers. While this often makes some of the platforming easier than in most games, it can also become very annoying when all you want to do is drop to the ground but Cole keeps grabing every little thing between where you were standing and where you want to land.  If you get bored in the game, there are blast shards to collect, and for every so many, you'll add another power node (your energy bar basically). You can also collect Dead Drops, which is audio recordings that help fill in the background of the main story.  There are 15 good guy missions and 15 bad guy missions, but every time you complete one, you lock out one of the others. So like I said, it's good to decide early on whether you want to be good or bad. There are 40 story missions and I don't know how many side missions, but there are quite a few. To get through the game probably takes a good 15 hours if you take the time to do every side mission and take the time to do some serious blast shard collecting.  I've beaten the game both as good and evil, and I must say that I enjoyed being evil a lot more. You can be a lot more destructive, plus Cole just looks really cool when he's evil. There are three difficulties, and playing on Easy is in fact easy. Plus, on a positive note, the game uses a very good checkpoint system, so if you die during a mission you never have to backtrack that far or replay the same mission over and over. If you die while not in a mission, just in free roam, then you just respawn at a med clinic at no cost to you.  I very much love this game. It's one of the best super hero games that I've ever played.

1033,72647,4,False,"12 7, 2005",A4BA2SSCQ2W56,B000ARJ1RQ,David Smith,"i'm a HUGE cod fan.  i've played call of duty: united offensive. till i was virtually comatose :D  anyway..  i was very excited about COD 2.  in a way it's a disappointment and in a way it's not.  simply put, it's a very different game from UO.  UO is one of the top video games ever made, due to its realism and excitement.  it makes you feel like you're really in a war.  i never feel like i'm really in a war in COD 2.  i feel like i'm playing an improved version of counterstrike: source.  is that a bad thing?  no.  fun is fun is fun.  all i care about really is having fun.  how is this game different?  well.. the pace is fast.  someone called this game ""arcade,"" that's a good description.  there's less ""camping"" out, less strategy, and more running around quickly, less carefulness about it altogether.  the graphics are great and the game runs much smoother than UO which is a big positive.  i had lots of problems running the intensive video of UO.. not with this one!  also the maps are MUCH smaller.  every single multiplayer map here is tiny.  personally i think that's a good thing because i hated the boring tank maps in UO.  also smaller maps mean MORE ACTION!!!  there's none of the boring walking around for 15 hours with no action like in UO.  i literally think i spent more time WALKING in UO than actually fighting!!  what's the point of that?  the point of  a game is action!  still, this isn't 100% a good thing.  the maps need to be bigger, because smaller maps skew the action towards automatic weapons instead of rifles and sniper rifles.  i used rifles a lot in UO.. in this game, it's like what's the point?  you can do anything you need with an mp44 or bren, and you'll use the ""room clearing"" weapons (sten, tommy gun) a lot too.  there's also a new weapon, the trench gun (known as a shotty or shotgun) that you have to run up to people fast and close with and shoot them once to kill them.  a lot of people hate this weapon and some servers ban it (getting killed by them out of nowhere sucks) but it can be pretty fun too.  no artillery, no vehicles, and no set spawn points to ""rape"" are VERY VERY VERY good improvements.  instead of dealing with a stupid tank or getting blown up the second you step inside one, you have control of your destiny, the way COD always should have been.  also another feature i love is voice chat.  you don't need teamspeak software, you simply get a headset, plug it in and you can talk with voice to your teammates.  only a few people use this, but i find it to be very fun.  no more typing out messages to your team!  just say it and keep moving!  other things..  some things about cod 2 are silly.  skulls to indicate where an enemy is?  red dots showing where an enemy is?  that's kind of dumb, but luckily servers are editing these options.  if you hop on any server, it's likely they won't have these things.  this game is kind of the antithethis of UO where everyone camped...  you can't camp much in this game.  this means you can move around with more confidence instead of looking at every corner for campers every time you move.  also less rifles means you get killed less with long-range enemies.  is this game as good as UO?  no.  but with the improvements over the annoying aspects of UO, i've played ONLY cod 2 ever since!  i tried to play UO for a little bit and couldn't stand it.  a better game would be one where elements of cod 2 and UO are blended together, but until then, this is simply a fun, fast-paced action game.  i was unimpressed with the single player, but who gets cod for the single player???  it's all about playing against real human beings.  things i forgot..  the way cod made the grenades in this game was DUMB.  an indicator tells you where it's going to explode, making nade kills virtually impossible.  but servers have taken this indicator option away too, and made it where you can ""cook"" (prime) nades, which makes nades much much more fun.  friendly fire is much less fun because there's so much crowding and small maps that it makes it more of a nuisance sometimes than a good thing.  you'll end up having to check your compass for friendlies before you throw a grenade.  still it's not too bad.  one more note:  all the idiot moderators who don't want people cussing need to get a life.  they have no problem with kids playing a violent game where you kill 30 people in one match, but they want to have control over the players, telling them they can't use ""naughty"" words and kicking them if they question the idiot's authority.  if you think words are worse than violence, you have a serious mental problem and need to be locked up.  i want to play a game, not have some moron tell me what to do like i'm still in school.  long live profanity!!!!  however i have noticed more friendliness and cussing in COD 2 which is great.  so many jerks play UO... cod 2 is a game for ""the people.""  enjoy! :)  edit - i use rifle a lot in this game now (except on certain maps such as burgundy).  there is a pretty steep learning curve with the rifle, but once you get used to it, it's a lot of fun.  as in UO, if you're using rifle or sniper rifle, it helps a lot to pick up an mp44 or short range weapon for close combat).  there's also a decent amount of room to use the sniper rifle (depending on the  layout of the map).  sadly, there is still an extremely limited number of maps in COD 2 as of august 2006 (though there are some custom maps on many servers), but it's a VERY addicting game nonetheless.",where do i start...,1133913600,6.0,,,player addict combat compass i've comatose cuss excite ever fight player suck actually room problem software weapon get point dumb many thing disappointment make crowd till different stupid learning range fun really enemy tell annoy arcade point kind limit quickly kill bore big step bit school version would skulls forgot excitement bad vehicle small explode violence teammates improved running set mean call ban note unite every small offensive uo duty away move much amount none luckily enjoy like positive nuisance graphic shoot pace nowhere custom question grenade everyone can't spent naughty due bren curve gun problem elements serious deal layout well long friendly one personally love new make option help likely camper sniper certain time hate call top being tommy carefulness artillery friendly game also talk match decent still anyway voice inside human shotty destiny rifle profanity play since map try though run impossible there's kill use always lock realism notice type blown tank camp hated second virtually play use cook nade extremely fire intensive red violent however hour automatic server simply know need think mental war lot map clear bad tell moderator big idiot run camp mean edit counterstrike le altogether huge strategy little idiot's thing silly lot august enemy chat good single use team game steep message what's sometimes check corner authority close fast kid smoother i'm word move life cod well say confidence another get antithethis look jerk care control stand option find way feature depend grenade someone action multiplayer video skew long-range towards pick weapon great shotgun dot take description indicate spawn feel real headset source put nades hop that's play blend show walk sten moron server live go friendliness tell together prime number want kick kill fast-paced fan literally trench aspect except edit camped unimpressed never plug indicator short around sadly rape instead teamspeak end make tiny people nonetheless rifle get burgundy throw anything keep improvement pretty

So what's new here: there are new dungeons and the ability to look around with the analog stick. And the switch to HD makes this game really stand out.  The Story: You control Shiren, a wandering ronin, who is accompanied by a talking ferret named Koppa. Their journey leads them to the Tower of Fortune, in search of a way to change their fate.  Gameplay: Like most Mystery Dungeon games or similar roguelikes, moving around dungeons is turn-based, so for every move you make, it equals one turn. Your foes also move in random patterns and requires strategy and the right placement to make it through alive. There is treasure and equipment that can be found in the dungeons. Permadeath is part of the roguelike design, so if you die, you lose all your items and have to start at level 1. Enemy placement and dungeons are randomized as a result. When starting out in a new dungeon, you have to ""map it out"" by exploring every single are in the dungeon to reveal it completely. The game also does feature and day-and-night cycle; when it nighttime, your vision decreases and you'll be unable to see enemies from afar.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is wanting an RPG with challenge and those who are fans of the roguelike genre.

This game has received a great deal of negative criticism....much of it I feel unwarranted. If a game has what it takes to encourage me to finish it, is fun and compelling then it has succeeded for me. I've finished very few of the highest rated titles because they just didn't hold my interest or were too realisticlly hard.  Here are my specific comments about XIII Thirteen:  1. The game is very unique in it's art form of cel-shading. Although I'm just an amateur artist, I feel the game is truly a great creation and renders a one of kind experience. The art graphics, settings, music, comic text and pop-up features and cut-scenes are amazing and coordinated very well. The first couple of missions aren't the best so continue on and you most likely will enjoy the game more as you progress. However, the first few missions set the stage for the story and are quite necessary.  2. For the most part the game is quite fast paced, varied, intriguing and exciting. The stealth parts were not my favorite but did provide a change of pace and the testing of one's senses, judgement, & special techniques rather than just bullet ""ripping.""  3. There are a few swear words in the game but much less than most M-17 titles. The violence is in comic book form and only becomes quite bloody and graphic when using throwing knifes and the scoped crossbow with bolts.  4. There are a variety of weapons with respective strengths and weaknesses. Short bursts are more effective & accurate than full auto. The game has some interesting equipment to aid in the drama. My fav was the rapple hook gun used to complete various missions objectives.  5. Gamers who want to ""save"" anywhere, have free roaming game solutions-rather than linear missions, want Half-Life 2 or Far  Cry type graphics may not like this title. To me, because of it's uniqueness and the successful rendition of all the parts I rate it highly. This game is no less ""professionaly"" developed than other more popular titles.  There are quick save options available after completing checkpoints so you don't always have to start the level completely over again. Mostly the checkpoints are appropriately spaced. There were about three that caused me some frustration and a bit of time to complete.  6. The artificial intelligence of the enemies was well balanced for me. I don't want a lengthy game to be too impossible where my main character dies so frequently from one shot kills that I become overly frustrated and don't want to play the game anymore.  7. This game is a ""Graphic Book Adventure"" or comic book first-person shooter. As such, liberties are taken with super human abilities for heroes, villans, enemies, soldiers, etc. Take this into consideration. If you want a pure squad based or super ""realistic' combat or drama title then this game is probably not for you. Comic books are loud, colorful, bold, often unrealistic, and sometimes simple minded...but they can be fun and exciting.  8. The voice acting was very good. Several professional actors supplied the main character voices. The voices were plain and distinct and not long-winded....just enough to provide instruction, lead the story and theme along, and generate mystery, suspense, fear, and deceit.  9. The story was very intriguing and interesting. It was great to learn one by one who the presidential assassination conspirators were. The ending is quite clever and begs for a sequel but it is unlikely that will happen due to the games lackluster sales (unfortunately)  10. There is a variety of graphical renderings and settings... from canyons, docks, buildings, bases, waterways, etc. The ambient sound effects are very good. I found it best with my sound system to turn down the software sound settings to abt 2/3rd and use my speaker volume control to near max. The bass noises in the game are well done.  11. In summary, XIII Thirteen is a very fun, colorful, intriguing, and exciting first-person shooter experience. It was worth the money at full price and even more so now when you can purchase it for a few bucks.

I need to return it as it is defective but I'll review what was right and wrong.  The good:  The Cherry MX Brown keys are a joy to type on. I am not a pro but a good hunt and pecker and it types great. The layout is very nice for a traditional keyboard. The detachable wrist rest is very comfortable and coated with the same smooth rubbery material as the keys and trim on the keyboard.

In the number row the keys are printed reversed so the numbers are above the symbols so the numbers are lit well. The Windows Key is not only missing it had no easy enable. It took some deep researching with a really awful online tutorial to figure out how to reprogram the Windows Key to work and be activated. I emailed support but the first answer back to me was wrong. This was later corrected in their online FAQ section and is now correct. I tried to sign up with CS Storm's online user forum. I was denied access without an explanation.

1066,53916,4,False,"05 29, 2004",A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B0001JXACA,Jeff Johnson,"This is a side scrolling puzzle game, six worlds, eight levels in each. You play Mario, and Donkey Kong has stolen wind up Mario doll toys from a toy factory. Yes, this is seriously the plot! As Mario, you start a level, and you are able to jump (A button), when on top of objects, you can lift them over your head (B button), and you can perform advanced tricks, like pressing left, right and the A button to perform a high jump. The eight levels each have two parts to them, the first part, Mario must get the key to a door, then get it back to the door, if he throws the key (which sometimes you need to), Mario will have 12 seconds to get the key again and pick it up, or else it will disappear and return to where the key was originally. Then the second part is just to get to the wind up Mario doll and pick it up. It is a puzzle game, because in each level, there are red, yellow and blue switches, where if you hit a red switch, it makes red platforms and ladders appear, and the colored platforms and ladders disappear. After the first world it gets more tricky with vines and cables for Mario to climb, then in later levels there are conveyer belts with switches to reverse them. Timing is also important, such as in some levels you must throw a key onto a conveyer belt, and hit a switch to reverse the conveyer belt, then race to hit a switch to enable a yellow colored platform before the key drops off the belt into something that could destroy the key. There are also enemies that are strategically placed, along with ways to get around them or make them disappear. The levels are not big, only four screens large, but the levels don't need to be large, from how clever Nintendo has made the puzzles. Each world has a theme to it, the first level is the toy factory theme, second is a forest theme, third is a lava palace and three other themes. The first six levels of each world are strictly to get a key and get a Mario doll in each of them. Then the seventh level of each world is where Mario must lead the six wind-up Mario dolls through the level, if one of the dolls don't make it to the end of the level, that will effect the eighth level. The eight level of each world is a battle with Donkey Kong. For each level you have to do something different to beat the bad monkey, while Donkey Kong stands in one place and does something to defend himself, usually by throwing things at Mario. However many of the six dolls that made it through the seventh level will be how much energy Mario has when he faces Donkey Kong, so if three wind-up Mario dolls get destroyed in the seventh level, Mario can be hit three times in his battle with Donkey Kong at the end of each world. At the start of each level, it shows you how to perform a new trick or a hint to get you past something. This is a generalized hint, nothing specific, with a little animation showing you how to do the trick.

Just to give anyone out there more info, I'll explain all the different controllers that I tested with this device.  I plugged the device into my PS3 and first tried my two Sony PS2 dual shock controllers. They worked to some extent, except I had no left or up on the D-pad. Otherwise, the analog sticks worked fine.  Next, I tried my two Madcatz knock off PS2 dual shock controllers. Surprisingly, they both worked perfectly. I tested them on all my games and had no issues at all.  Last but not least I tried my good old Sony brand PS1 controllers, and yet again, they worked perfectly with all my games that don't require an analog stick. I actually prefer to play most fighting games with the d-pad anyway, and the original PS1 controllers are of the highest quality compared to more modern controllers.  One thing I'd like to point out that I really like about this device is that it turns one USB port into two PS1/2 controller ports. The PS3 recognizes both controllers connected through this device as separate controllers. I have some PC USB analog controllers that I've used before with my PS3 and I was limited to two slots because of only having two USB ports. This device now solves that problem.

1087,64427,4,False,"05 11, 2005",A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B0007WWYLY,A. Griffiths,"""Haunting Ground"" seems to be championing the sub-genre of survival horror established by the ""Clock Tower"" series...in fact this game has ""Clock Tower 3"" written all over it. That was a good game, but repetition's not always a good thing. Still there are lots of impressive features to this game that make it fun to play.  The main character of the game is a young girl called Fiona who finds herself waking up in a huge castle after a car accident. Why is she here and why are strange characters pursueing her around the massive building? These are the questions you must ultimately uncover answers for, but there is a whole lot of running and puzzle solving to be done before then.  I say running, because for the most part, that's what you are going to be doing. In this game, the main character does not attack her foes. Like ""Clock Tower"" before it, if an enemy appears you are faced with a few options which consist of running for your life, hiding, or finding hot spots in the castle where one-off retaliation actions can be sprung. This is on the most part well implemented, plus the chase situations seem more perilous than those in ""Clock Tower"", as the baddies seem far more persistent and less easily fooled in this game. The mechanics of panic are very similar, with Fiona getting more frightened the closer the pursuer gets and the more near-misses she withstands. Expect to see the screen shudder and the colours to drain as Fiona starts to lose her cool, culminating in a total washout of colour and blurring of the picture if she loses it totally. In this condition, Fiona will run at random and fall over most of the time...if you let things get this bad, you're pretty much looking at Game Over, as the baddie will more often than not close in and finish off our heroine for good (particularly nasty death scenes in this game - relying mostly on sounds and your imagination). Cleverly, the use of hiding places is only randomly successful, as Fiona might successfully hide in a closet on one occasion, only to find that the enemy doesn't just walk past the next time she's in it, but comes right up and opens the door!  Luckily there are curative items that you can use during chases to alleviate panic and injury, as well as a few offensive items to throw. Plus of course one major feature that I haven't even mentioned yet - Fiona has a pet dog! Well, it's not really a pet. Fiona befriends the animal early in the game, and he becomes her constant companion. Now this aspect of the game I really like. Fiona has several commands that she can give the dog (Hewie), and it's up to you to decide when, and which things to say and do to get Hewie to provide help. It's during chase sequences that Hewie shows his real worth, as Fiona can set him on the enemy to bite and attack while she gets away. He also helps with some puzzles, requiring some lateral thinking from the player as he can go into small spaces where Fiona can't fit, and she can also go places (climbing ladders, for example) where he can't follow. So expect a bit of fun in working out how to get both your characters around the castle when needed. The dog accompaniment is a  major part of the game, so it is well worth taking the trouble to build a good bond with Hewie, especially as it can affect the ending you get. It's very easy to do, though and much enjoyment comes from training him with constant commands, and watching him explore, sniff around or just lie on the floor if he gets bored - a great character and with perfect AI - responsive, but prone to whims of his own. I couldn't resist having Fiona stroke him and tweak his ears all the time - I'm sure I spoiled him! Just be sure to try and keeps tabs on where he is and interact with him a lot - he'll soon follow you everywhere.  On that note, the castle and all the other locations of the game are very large, and they are beautiful environments, although the castle is very oddly designed, and I don't mean intentionally. Sure the place is creepy and has traps and dead ends that make Fiona's life more of a misery than it already is, but it feels like the designers just built the required rooms and chambers and then linked them up with long passages to suit the gameplay, without a thought as to how this would make a realistic building as a whole. If you look at the in-game map, it resembles a maze for lab rats more than a real building! ( A bit like the mansion in the original Resident Evil, which had loads of rooms completely inside the building with bizarre shapes and no windows). However, as I said, the cosmetic look of the locations is wonderful, especially an elaborate palace in the final stages of the game that looks like something out of Final Fantasy X! The same goes for the characters. Fiona is absolutely beautiful, and her face moves realistically to portray happiness, sadness and fear when required. It's almost a given now that seeing the Capcom name on a game means the graphic quaility is going to be above average, and you can definitely see that company's almost ""in house"" style and standard present here. Hewie is also wonderfully rendered, and has a real life of his own.  This is not a game for action fans - you won't be using any weapons or firepower here. The constant chasing can be quite wearing, as it can take a good few minutes to escape, which often results in you running a long way away from where you want to be, and backtracking all the way back again to carry on looking at that puzzle. It's also a very lonely game, there castle is totally devoid of life apart from Fiona and Hewie, and there are a mere handful of NPC's, and that includes enemies (there is only one enemy after you at a time). Luckily the two main characters are appealing that you will enjoy the growing companionship of a girl and her dog, and hope they both make it though alive. My only niggle is that Fiona doesn't exhibit a bit more courage, but insists on whimpering and crying during every cut scene when it would have been nice to see here toughen up a bit after dispatching the first few villains. The enemies are all suitably bizarre, my favourite being the icily-beautiful but unhinged maid - watch out for some very twisted cut-scenes featuring her! It also has the same rather sick undertones as it's predecessor and most of the enemies designs on Fiona are pretty despicable!  In closing, it seems to me that this whole game is an expansion of the final castle level of ""Clock Tower 3"" (which was also set in a castle), and is something of an exercise in refinement for the game creators, who are hoping to make the ultimate version of their unique survival/run away-horror. An immense spiral staircase near the end of the game (still impressive, none the less) recalls the one in that level very clearly. But this game is far, far bigger than CT3, and possibly tougher. All things considered, I would say that it succeeds in being a fairly solid horror game, but it only really comes alive thanks to its addition of dog power. The satisfaction that comes from helping and receiving help from your canine pal echos the subtle joys of the superb ""ICO"", in which the player also had to interact with a companion to get through the game. In fact, the two games are not dis-similar in several ways which is much higher praise indeed than the comparison to ""Clock Tower 3"".

I will try to address the problems I don't see people complaining.  Current level 35 Aspec, 32 Bspec, 95% finished, just gained the redbull x1. However, I don't think I can keep going anymore with the endurance race, other wise you will see me on tomorrows paper that somebody died from playing gt5 with a blood clot. I would rate this game a 2 1/2 star but I can't and if they take off the ""simulator"" label I would give it a 3 1/2 star. This game is no way close to be a simulator.  I will start with the bads. NO PRE-QUALIFICATION. WHY? I mean why, why, why, I HAVE to be the last one to start the race? You will see alot of contradiction in the game regarding the word ""simulator"". Vehicle control is highly inaccurate. All the tune-cars are stubbornly better than ANY super car. How can a 89 civic mugen type R has better handling than a Ferrari enzo or a lambo? I just don't get the logic here. Bspec is another question mark. What is the point that just sit there and watch the computer race? The bspec endurance race is another joke. So, Sony expected me to sit and watch the game for 4 hours or 24 hours? or maybe leave it on while I go to bed? I am confused. I think Sony owe me an explanation. How about the endurance mode in Aspec? Is sony really anticipate players will sit in front of the tv and orbit the SAME track over and over again for 9, even 24 hours? There's no way to save the game in pit stop, so you have to finish the entire race. I thought video games supposed to be fun. What is the fun factor? Some people might say, you can pause it and take a break. The point is why do I want to do that by leaving the ps3 on especially it has the problem of over heating? Difficulty level is another problem. You can find races that are extremely easy while others in the ""special"" modes are literally impossible to get gold with the ""given"" vehicle. Menu navigation is a step back from gt4. In the tune page, the cursor navigation is awkward. Lets say you want to navigate the cursor to the right because items on the right, it will always go the the further right, and you think clicking left will bring you back to the original spot? It will not. It's more obvious on the changing tire page. One more thing that really annoying me is when you log in into GT mode at main menu. ""Do you want to log into PlayStation network""? YOU BETTER SAY YES, other wise the game will be ignorantly ask you twice. What the hell is Sony thinking? Even after extensive 6 years of developing and deceptive delays, the game still has decent amount of bugs that the vehicle control freeze during several occasion. This game claimed to have more than 1000 cars. However, most of them are to be purchased through online dealership. It take years and years to refresh the list, so good luck on find the one you need. I am still looking for the Suzuki escudo. Vehicle purchases are ridiculous during first 1/2 of the game. Each race only earns 10 or 20 thousand dollar so don't be intimidated by the 100+ thousand dollar price tag. It will become much easier when you have access to the online event. How about the 10 million dollars Ferrari F10 formula that you save your ass to buy and on the YAHOOO moment you finally got it and just to realize it's only good to use on one race out of the ENTIRE game? Sony, I want to choke you. Finally, the paint color system is bad. Why I can't just pay for any color I want instead of using the selected ones? Why I can not change the camera angle when I see the car in the showroom? Why can't I pause and take a good look at the tail light or front bumper?  The goods: If you can omit all the bad stuffs and aggravation from above and you can get a used copy for 30 bucks, go for it. It has good graphics, plenty of cars to choose and use.

1093,110611,4,False,"05 23, 2009",A3HWLS0TSRHCKH,B000RZPW9W,Rawr2020,"After playing and becoming very frustrated with Warhammer online I resubbed to Age of Conan after a six month absence. My wife and I were big fans of the REH books and quickly reserved copies for the game.  After a month of broken mechanics and content we left. Now after a few weeks of playing on my level 80 barbarian and my level 30 alts this feels like a brand new game!   Despite the bad feelings older players had I think they should retry the game.  The mechanics are smoother, combos have shortened for melee, and I myself have experienced much less lag.  I don't get the memory leaks I used to have and don't get stuck on anything so easily.   Hands down this is the most beautiful and intense MMO out right now. The graphics even on low for me are gorgeous and the real time combat always keep me on my toes.  The end level instances are fun and beautifully rendered. If graphics are your thing you cant go wrong with AoC.  Also Ive found, IMO, that you don't need to grind levels in villas thanks to the new questing area and the new daily instance, a very welcomed blessing.   PVP is extremly fun. Though Im on a PVE server and cannot speak for the PVP servers I find mini pvp games, usually capture the flag, to pop often and are really enjoyable.  There are some balance issues like with any MMO especially one thats been out only a year.  The siege warfare in the game is twice as indepth than Warhammer for me, no bottle necking or mindless zerging. Its large scale but you need good commanders to get the job done. Siege weapons are important and not just eye candy.  To me siege pvp on Age of Conan is the definition of meaningful PVP, you feel the rush of victory and the decimation of defeat.   With any review that has its pros you need its cons as well and though I love Age of Conan it does have them.  One stated earlier the balance in the game wher Tempests of Sets, damage dealing and healers, are king though Assasins and Rangers deal death just as good, or bad depending on which end of the knife you're on.  But there is a GIGANTIC PATCH on the way SOON, and I cant stress that enough, and the majority of it is class changes, good or bad I cant say since I have to wait myself.  Another is for the end level players who only focus on PVE.  If youve done everthing in terms of dungeons then youll find little to do until they had the new questing areas even then raiders must wait til Tier Three is released. The only real remedy is to have alts or take your time and enjoy the ride leveling. Both of which I am doing and find it fun.  For those who love fluff and social aspects to the game might, though Im enjoying it, might need to wait for the up and coming patch.  I have met many old friends on Age of Conan who have told me all the changes when my old lady and I resubbed like scholars of Hyperborea. Weve met many new players who became allies with us like in Conan's adventures. Were enjoying every minute. Once more with the new patch coming withing a couple weeks time we are very excited about the game  So for the new guys don your hauberk strap on your blade and get ready for a wild ride. For the older players get that new PVP gear, or get a new toon to check out those sweet new areas and take the beauty of Conans savage world in deep.

This does not seem much better than Spider-man 2 for the PS2.  There is a few new additions in there.  Such as a slightly improved combat system, a fresh coat of paint, and a little bit of reflection on some surfaces.  The combat system seems terribly incomplete, almost no transition between moves, no fluidity at all, it just felt rushed.  Bosses and some missions felt unnecessarily frustrating, unable to see some enemies, while they would attack what you were trying to protect.  I also had several problems with mission ""coins"" disappearing.  Stupidly powerful enemies that stopped taking damage after you had given them an unrelenting beating for nearly 10 minutes, knocking them over countless times.  The ""God of War""-esque button system is really innovative, and absurdly complicated.  God of War normally limited its buttons to just the face buttons.  This one throws face, control stick movements and R1,R2, L1, L2 at incredibly inept time, so unless you are really quick, some give you less than a second to complete the combination.  Luckily when you mess up a combination, you are never put back at the ""start of the level"" or anything, it just repeats and unlike God of War, it will use the same sequence you just failed, however, fail one against a boss character, he can do up to 25% damage to you, 4 failures and you are toast, or really close to it.  Control could have had more attention paid to it.  The swinging is cool, but run into a bulding and the camera will sometimes freak and get stuck somewhere momentarily, thats not a terrible detriment to gameplay, its when the camera gets stuck somewhere in a fight and you swinging at nothing you can see, thats frustrating.  Bruce Campbell makes his return as the Narrator, though he really gives you nothing new for this game aside from the ""Matrix-Style"" bullet time.  If you have played Spider-man 2, don't expect too much new here.  Like I said a fresh coat of paint.  This does not exactly live up to the free roaming sandbox gameplay.  Framerate tends to struggle in closed areas, people are not very well detailed at all, they all look like scared puppy dogs, while you are very well designed, and the highest amount of detail is paid to Spidey and the bosses.  With that said this game does have its shiny points.  Physics are somewhat used here, the sun reflects off windows realistically, at night you can go to buildings and look inside, even though they may be a cheap-o JPEG sitting behind a window, detail was paid to it a little.  Spidey looks incredible, up close you can really see the detail in the suit, and black suit spidey is a crazy blast to play.  However, *(SPOILER)*  when you get towards the end, and you have to fight Venom and Sandman, Venom is not really a problem, as long as you keep him stunned.  Sandman is a pain in the glutes when you take over as New Goblin, the sixaxis control is frustrating.  Laying down while playing this part is almost impossible.  And judging the bombs is all hands down frustrating for a casual gamer such as myself.  Final thought:  If time and attention were paid to this game it could truly have been incredible.  I would have waited another 6 months to a year for a truly great Spiderman game rather than 3 mediocre ones.  This game is fun, and if you are a Spidey-freak, definitley don't pass this one up.  If you understand the history of film-game franchises give this one a rent.  Other than that, pass this one by.

It is as large as the G502 and feels much more natural than smaller mice (unless you have small hands). - The responsiveness is the best I've used. - And a huge advantage that Razer has over Logitech is their Synapse software. Specifically the fact that RAZER SYNCS ALL SETTINGS TO THE CLOUD. Logitech doesn't. This means that when you switch mice or computers all your settings follow you. If you have multiple computers (I do) - especially if you game on them - this is a huge advantage as many gamers like setting up specific settings. - Buttons are very responsive with great tactile feedback. Ditto the scroll wheel. - The cord has just the right weight and stiffness. Too light a cord and it isn't durable. Too heavy and it impacts mouse movement. - The colored lighting effects unique to the Chroma series are a cool gimmick. - It isn't cordless.

1107,157426,4,False,"06 25, 2009",A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B0014ULQB2,Brian,"Red Faction remains on top of the massive destruction sandbox genre with Guerrilla. Mars is under iron fisted control by the once liberating EDF, who has now become a openly genocidal tyranny, because covering up mass civilian slaughters is apparently not worth the effort. You are Alex Mercer, demolitions expert and new found point man for the Red Faction, a underground resistance that you've been a member of for 11 seconds... wait, what?  Your missions are the basic story driven resistance on the run until you become the revolutionary juggernaut. Weapons are the basic plethora, either plundered from enemy dead or cobbled together from scrap materials, which are your basic monetary funding. The story however really, truly, desperately needed a runup, as you arrive on mars, brother dead, you, resistance, join, lead demolition missions. That story is rammed into your gullet in about as much time as it took me to write that sentence. At least doom had you on a boring seeming hunt for a lost technician before dropping you in the soup.  Prepare to destroy anything and everything in sight. Entertaining propaganda and spin stories from the controlling forces are hilarious, and background chatter takes a while to become repetitive, giving it a good feel of gritty, downtrodden rebels. Despite being instantly promoted to point man, you are treated with some disdain and contempt, and are sent off with sanctions to not screw up by just about everyone. Sabotage and insurrection actions actually make sense, and rather than send you against strongholds first, you can cut power, destroy fuel reserves and checkpoints, and generally cause mass chaos rather than charge headlong into heavily guarded meat grinders.  Graphics and audio are entertaining, though some buildings look pretty pathetic when they're collapsing, giving the feel of watching a scale model rather than a real building. Voices are well acted and appropriately emoted, though the blatant love interest side arc is about as subtle as a hammer to the face.  Nits are widespread, and cause enough teeth grinding to cost this a full five stars. Your sledgehammer is your best weapon by far, and theres not even a halfhearted explanation as to how you manage to plow through meter thick rebar enforced concrete walls with a lazy swing. You need scrap to get more pockets to carry more demolition charges. Hills with more than a 5% incline are unclimbable, and you can't exactly be sneaky when you have to plow through every wall rather than climb over them. Physics of building collapses are nice, but momentum physics are godawful. You can knock soldiers over the horizon with a well timed hammer blow, and an atv can knock a twelve ton dump truck out of the way like its a tinker toy. Alarm levels don't go down with finding good hiding places or killing off small patrols, but reentering a hideout with a small army on your butt drops it to zero. For a game that tries to be as serious as your basic medal of honor, it fails horribly in some portions of suspension of disbelief. There's no briefing on the main bad guys in your codex, or even on your sudden new found allies or superiors outside of loading screens.  Regardless of some major gameplay and story issues, the game is fun, which is what matters. Charging into HW without any backup or preparatory work will instantly get you killed, and while you definitely have superhero level endurance and amazing combat skills for a technician, this manages to be a game that will always make you giggle as you tear through buildings and army battalions like a wrecking ball. I'd still make this a rent first, as there are enough issues that can rub certain gamer types the wrong way.

I will not be mentioning, in any way, how good it is compared to the PlayStation 3 or vice versa. If you're looking for a comparison between the two consoles, you're reading the wrong review.  I just recently purchased this Holiday Bundle and have enjoyed having it every minute since. The console itself is pretty bulky and heavy, so as long as you won't be moving it around a lot, it's not bad at all. It comes with a wireless controller, and this controller is probably one of the most comfortable controllers I've ever had the privilege of using to play games with. It fits comfortably in your hands, the buttons are pretty close together so you don't have to move your hands at all, and the bumpers/triggers are conveniently located.  This holiday bundle comes with a wired headset (used for playing on Xbox Live so you can chat with other players), an A/V component video cable (so you can hook it up to your HDTV right out of the box), a 60 GB hard drive (giving you plenty of space to store your game data), an ethernet cable (allowing you to connect to Xbox Live right away), plus 2 games (Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda). I'm guessing it comes with these two games because this bundle is targeted for the kids during the holiday season. I'm 24 years old, and I am having a great time playing those two games, so I'm sure if you're planning on giving this bundle as a gift to a non-child, they might enjoy it as much as I do.  The Xbox 360 Dashboard (which is the name of the user-interface) is quite easy to use. Microsoft recently provided an update for the Dashboard, and it looks a lot better than the previous version. There are so many options to explore and it's very easy to navigate.  Xbox Live is a neat feature. They have two membership options: Silver (free) and Gold (paid subscription). Silver membership is used for accessing and downloading free content from the Xbox Live Marketplace. You can also use Silver to download paid content as well (movies, TV shows, etc). Xbox Live Gold allows you to play online with other players from around the world. You can't play online without a Gold membership. With Gold, you also have some other privileges, as well. You can find out which exact privileges you get by reading the manual of the game you're playing, as they vary from game to game. Microsoft also starting using Netflix membership with Xbox Live. If you have Xbox Live Gold and a Netflix membership, you can stream HD movies directly to your Xbox via Marketplace!  Xbox 360's game selection is quite great and varied when it comes to target audience. There are games which are targeted for the younger crowd, and there are others which are targeted for 18+ players. Due to this, the Xbox 360 makes for a great gift for anybody who likes to play video games.  I will be honest with you. The Xbox 360 isn't as perfect as I want to make it sound.  First off, it will produce A LOT of heat. To prevent this from happening, you'll want to sit your console horizontally allowing the air to pass from both ends of the system. If your console is vertical, the air passage on the bottom is completely blocked, so the console will be trying to blow out all the hot air out of the vent on the top. Unfortunately, since the hard drive is also on the top, the vent is relatively smaller and may cause the system to overheat. Luckily the newer systems don't overheat as often as the older ones, but it's still a problem anybody can run into.  Another downside to the Xbox 360 is their accessories are still relatively expensive. A wired controller is still at $30, wireless network adapter is $100, a wireless controller costs nearly as much as a newly released game at $50, and these are to just name a few. That's the good thing with the Holiday Bundle. It comes with a lot of useful accessories that people would end up buying anyway (if they originally had purchased the Xbox 360 Core Console which only comes with the system and one wired controller).  The worst problem with the Xbox 360 is the infamous ""Red Ring of Death."" For those of you who don't know what this is, here's an explanation. After you turn on your console, and you see three red lights around the power button, that's a bad sign. This means there's a hardware issue with your 360, and can only be repaired by sending in your 360 to Microsoft's Repair Center. Microsoft now has a 3-year warranty covering the Red Ring of Death, but unfortunately, the RROD is inevitable. Whether it will be in 6 months or 2 years, more likely than not, Xbox 360 owners will run into this problem.  Overall, I'm definitely happy with the investment of the Xbox 360 Pro Holiday Bundle. It has everything I've been looking for in a console plus more.

My comments are still the same, however.  If you liked the other Twisted Metal games, you will likely enjoy this one.  Lack of online play and a bit of a difficulty imbalance are the only things really keeping this from being a 5-star game, in my eyes.  The controls are a bit difficult to get used to, in terms of using them with finesse, at least.  One of the boss fights is nearly infuriating with difficulty, while the last boss of the game seems a bit too easy, in comparison.  Judging by current standards, on the brink of the next generation consoles becoming the standard, it is hard to rate it based on technological standpoints, but in its time it was superior.  In addition, the style of the storyline is very interesting, and worth looking at.  I played through God of War, and in some ways one of the cutscenes from God of War reminded me of the style used in this game.  So ultimately, if you like the style of game, definitely get it.  If you don't like the gameplay typically, you won't like this one, as it has a similar feel to the others in the series.  However, this is not a must-buy, by any means, in my opinion.

 are you just standing around, waiting to get hit?  i beat the first level in less than 3 minutes, and the second level in less than 5 minutes.  i'm not bragging, but i just think some people must be utterly terrible at videogames.  and yes, i died enough to unlock Easy mode, but i didn't go to it.  i bit my lip and kept on hacking my way to the end, where i'm at now, on Normal mode.  sure, some of the BOSSES are difficult, but the only HARD one i've fought so far is the one i'm on now, the END BOSS.  none of the regular enemies in this game are hard, so why is everyone dying?  just keep your eyes peeled and you'll be fine.  me, i jump around ALL THE TIME.  this greatly reduces my chances of being hit.  the first level i had difficulty on was....mission 7, and it wasn't too bad.  you just have to be smart about things.  and every time that i've died, it has been my fault, not crappy programming, or crappy controls, or crappy camera angles, it was just me not being quick enough.  almost every enemy and boss in this game has attacks that can be blocked, and most of them can be seen coming from a mile away.  granted, this game is much more of a challenge than the earlier installments (i'm talking about the original, because i've omitted devil may cry 2 from my memory).  but just be smart about your attacks and evasive manuvers, and you'll be fine.  don't let all the whining about the difficulty from other people change your mind about purchasing this title.  hell, even magazine reviewers are saying this is hard, but i don't see why...honestly, it's not hard.  overall, this game is a great package.  packed with awesome action, in game and in cut-scenes, loaded with unlockable secrets and new difficulties, and by far the longest quest yet in the devil may cry series (right now i'm close to 18 hours and i'm at the end of the game), this game is just flat out amazing.  so, if you're up for a challenge (a fair one, i might add) then go ahead and pick this up.  trust me, if you love action, this game will blow you away...multiple times.  so, buy it and have a blast, and just remember....KEEP MOVING!",it's not hard,1110326400,2.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,boss...that twin reviewer hell i've understand standing say quicksilver rock powerful figure mess fine actually time last get dice open blow revolves sure mile stop ability was....mission write enemy beat model control original remember....keep right possible demonic point let far try yes evasive kind sword/devil-arm cry bit almost let brother difficulty block everything bad ahead jump hit quest chance difficult main overall two block arkham follow fight nifty greatly go do every may guy camera review count know trick evade over-the-top away hard trickster much none pathetic character luckily utterly unlocked plot basic program vergil blow shoot videogames level evil week four character take might gaurd as normal title everyone angle sword cut-scene unlock agile problem gonna unique everyone's omit why...honestly surprisingly see half-demon one counter-attack love package new memory sock help secret installation give load first freeze scar freakin help time launcher various buy movement game also area anyway rocket see whine numerous choose crappy style royal yet story battle girl allow tough style second cut-scenes motion-captured half-human crazy difficulty i'll swordmaster use tres voice-acting doppleganger extremely red top-notch mission hour lip boss smart say hero think reduces create next enough installment change cool dante must cutscene badass less purchase find huge fairly pack bad thing polygon attack face series blast unlockable back deal kick manuvers regular cutscenes low enemy good take quick terrible talk trust beating long list mind mood get white bos level close fault fast kept man corny move begin i'm peel best brag move awesome come look away...multiple well say lady die craptacular stand sleeve firearm slice reveal ease mysterious way trenchcoat manner grant add duplicate world moment hack action foe bald mode kick pick great already eye minute amaze magazine unlike earlier lastly involve that's brings gunslinger practice devil wait fought technique hair clown go die in-game jester especially fair challenge even easy responsive numero around progress okay end flat people available past keep

1153,34609,5,False,"05 7, 2009",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000067FDW,Cloud,"Having a below-average PC, I haven't even bothered checking out any computer games whatsoever and had to rely on console ports on the Playstation 3 or the Xbox 360. Back in the day I had Diablo II but other than that, I've mainly been on consoles but after getting a pretty sweet laptop, I figured ""eh, what the hell, see what the craze is about."" Now I've never played an MMO before, mainly because I hate subscription fees but also because of the lackluster PC I had so I can't compare this to Warhammer Online, EVE Online, Lord of the Rings Online...or really any of the ""Online"" ones. But other than that, I'll say that this is quite a worthwhile game to play...just watch your relationships deteriorate at the same rate your character's level raises...just kidding, or am I?  So after buying the game plus a game card for 2 months of play, in comes the incredibly lengthy install which literally took me from 6 in the afternoon to 4 in the morning and that's with a 100 MB/S connection speed. Then turns out that most of the names I was picking were not available and I'd rather have a ""real"" sounding name, not something like ""XxXkilla"" or something like that so after finally finding one, it was off to the races. Based on the kind of character you pick, you'll end up in a different area of the world than others. My first character was a night elf warrior so I was put in the tree of Teldrassil, a massive tree with purple foliage and visually I have to say it really looks impressive. Sure graphically the art style is ""cartoony"" but it's very pleasant to the eye, especially those with high-end PC's/Laptops with minimal framerate hitches or lag. It's also a nicely varied world with snow valleys, countryside having an almost pastoral feel to tranquil forests to ominous bogs.  As far as gameplay is concerned, at first you're a little ""now...how do you sell stuff?"", but eventually you will get the hang of it and it's incredibly accessible and the more you play the more things get added for you to use in the game such as additional skill slots, abilities for other weapons and skills that you can use from cooking, enchanting and the like. And with the ability to have multiple characters as ""alts"" or alternates, it'll be fresh and new from visually to gameplay since different classes get different skills and specialties. As far as PvP and PvE, I generally avoided PvP playing since I prefer co-op type games like Left 4 Dead and whatnot and I'd rather help out fellow players during tough spots than trying to kick someone's face in (which I have Street Fighter for, or at the very least, shoot their face with Call of Duty).  Now since this is an MMO, you have to get used to one thing, and this was the surprising part since it didn't bother me but this is heavily geared towards grinding. You know, ""kill 20 x to get 5 y for person Z"" and thankfully the drops are not that rare unlike some RPG's where it's like ""oh come on, should've had one by now"". Grinding is a big thing and too often you'll run into quest givers with many leading to other quests that'll yield bigger rewards once you reach the end. My one complaint about this is that some quests make you give a certain item or talk to an NPC you haven't met yet however your map/mini-map sometimes doesn't tell you till they're actually near and when you're told ""they're in the city"" my first thought was ""um...where?""  This isn't one of those kind of end paragraphs where I say this is the best MMO on the market and all the others don't have anything of World of Warcraft since, as I said, I haven't played them...plus one subscription based game's enough but I will say that Warcraft is quite a fun experience and certainly different than the console games I normally play but your addiction level may vary but there's enough content here to satisfy new players and plenty of depth and quests for the frequent players.",From game to phenomenon,1241654400,3.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,online...or hell i've rpg's cartoony say console lengthy ring player market street actually one get deteriorate many class thing certainly buy sure different till oh alts ability subscription pvp fun really quest valley part tell race ability far try kind speed city type lackluster kill big stuff pleasant almost finding afternoon forest rely finally raises...just quest pick fresh experience plus spot gameplay eye character's tell lag they're may craze know give duty name person think character cook xbox like them...plus shoot level come turn character um...where normally can't reward name paragraphs sell console npc drop one bog hitch play...just depth new add impressive someone's compare sweet port gear first certain help hate call also game talk ominous see install addiction game's vary reach bother playing style since yet co-op pastoral run there's specialty tough worthwhile rather relationships play i'll additional use nicely however prefer generally enchant near others lead fighter area night map/mini-map least enough i'd pc eventually big yield foliage leave little thing kid giver dead meet face back slots fellow now...how snow eh visually satisfy take online use varied come game watch elf countryside sometimes fee pve laptop mainly plenty art concern heavily playstation make xxxkilla purple best incredibly often whatsoever sound say bother pc's/laptops look quite warcraft below-average tranquil connection complaint world whatnot towards kick pick something weapon multiple feel real surprising hang unlike put that's rate play rare teldrassil morning computer ii mb/s high-end warhammer diablo tree warrior card skill frequent month especially item accessible literally figure even eve grind day it'll check skill graphically avoid alternate never massive mmo content framerate end lord available get base thankfully minimal anything pretty

1158,232242,5,False,"12 1, 2011",AU4BS4T7B3HHB,B004VQEO2E,Frederick Heind,"If you're reading this you're probably already familiar with this games gimmick, but I'll explain it anyway. It comes with a ""Portal of power"" and three figurines that you put on the portal, and in turn, they are ""transported"" into the game. There are, from what I understand,30 some toys in all, which can be bought separately, or there are some three character packs available, as well as some  ""Adventure packs"" which Include one new character, a new level, and a couple of items that can be placed on the portal to help you, such as a potion, or defensive swords that circle you. A full collection of all the toys, and the game itself, will probably run you upwards of 300 dollars. Is it worth it? That all depends on whether you like the game or not, and your fiscal state. If you are a parent you should be warned that your children will not be satisfied with the three toys that come with the game, as there are eight character elements, and you need at least one character of each element to unlock all the areas in the game. That aside they will probably want as many toys as they can get their hands on, so if you just plan on getting them a starter pack and nothing more they will probably be sorely disappointed and frustrated. It IS alot of money for a game, but really, the toys are half the fun. I admit it is a gimmick, but it is a very clever gimmick and one that appeals to me.  The story in the game is pretty basic stuff, probably geared towards between 6-10. You're the chosen portal master, and it's up to you to save Skylands, or something like that. The voice acting is well done,even if what is being said is somewhat corny at times. However there is a good amount of humor in the game,and like a good family film, there are some ""risque"" jokes that are cleverly worded in such a way will fly over the heads,not corrupting their innocent young minds, while at the same time getting a laugh from the adults.  The game itself is admittedly fairly simplistic, walk around shooting/attacking enemies, collecting keys, and solving some basic puzzles. It's simplicity is overcome by the quality with which it is made. Controls are excellent and it is very easy and intuitive to aim your weapons. You earn cash in the game which you can then in turn use to purchase new abilities for your character, and at a certain point you can choose one of two paths, determining which ability you want to master,as well as a basic leveling up system, so there is a small, albeit well implemented RPG element to the game. Each level has a different Hat to collect, which can be worn by any skylander, aside from altering their appearance, each hat increased a particular stat in some way. If at any time you regret your decision, or if you just want to start over for the heck of it, you can reset a character at any given time.(Don't worry though, it will never happen by accident.)Despite it's ease and simple nature, it is alot of fun to play, especially in a time where the hardcore game is kind, and games seemed to be designed to test ones sanity. A welcome change of pace for those looking for something new. Each character actually feels very unique, I have about 14 of them and they all have a unique feel to them. Some of them are more suited to certain areas than others, so when that happens just switch out a toy. There are no button presses required and you pick up exactly where you left off with your last guy, in a matter of 2-3 seconds.i haven't tried the co-op mode but I imagine kids would have a blast with it. Your skylanders stats(abilities, level, hat) is saved instantly to the toy itself, so if you have a pal with the game, you can take your skylander over to his place.  The graphics, while they certainly won't be winning any awards, get the job done. They have a pleasant quality to them, my only complaint is that there is some slight screen tearing. Music, while not overly catchy,it isn't bad either, and never becomes annoying.  The toys are half the fun though, and for collection minded individuals, look no further. They are well made and sturdy with a good amount of details, and are of a rather original design and style.  Skylanders is a great game for children of the right age bracket, or for those who just want something new and refreshing. It makes no qualms about what it is meant to be, nor should it. Yes it will cost a fair bit of change if your kid(or you) goes gung ho over it, but there is something to be said for owning a physical product for your investment rather than the same old soulless DLC.","An excellent game for children, and the hardcore crowd might enjoy it too.",1322697600,15.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,"power regret go saved dollar simplicity say alter toy hardcore actually done,even one young walk time last child get many certainly dlc soulless leveling different solve ability stats(abilities seem fun really turn annoy control original ability right cash point increase yes kind corrupt couple bit stuff pleasant separately ho screen would familiar bad word welcome include skylander choose either design press two collect meant system cleverly happen joke skylanders do small guy overcome simplistic laugh determine admit reset amount button like element seconds.i game,and heck transport innocent graphic level pace upwards come puzzle character adult pal product cost sword nothing unlock element unique state money place refresh appearance one instantly new make fiscal fly gimmick gear worth item portal certain help time time.(don't imagine game area anyway voice explain aim physical choose appeal style require story co-op old try though run potion basic three save exactly give rather film slight earn i'll use investment decision however shooting/attacking clever need half others alot stat job least suited circle change take hand kid(or intuitive eight leave music fairly blast quality aside place pack enemies act pack adventure good parent sorely worn figurine design come whether game risque individual purchase own particular collect win satisfied start plan heads,not corny kid buy hat defensive look happen well overly look age implement warn master read mind qualms ease somewhat way catchy,it admittedly complaint mind depend nature mode master,as towards sturdy pick something weapon great disappointed test feel already simple feel albeit accident.)despite put skylands play starter probably collection award bracket want full sanity switch especially fair path humor matter easy rpg never key around becomes worry excellent tearing make frustrate detail gung available get toy family pretty"

I just recently bought a PS3, however, and I knew that one of the games I wanted to purchase was ""Batman: Arkham Asylum.""  Why?  Because it looked amazing.  Well, it is.  The graphics are spectacular, and I'm not using that word lightly.  You can see the holes and tears Batman's suit acquires as he progresses through the levels; you can see minute details in the floors and walls and plants.  The water ripples, the leaves blow.  This game is about as real as a video game can be.  It's an amazing story, too: The Joker has taken over Arkham Asylum.  What's Batman to do?  Stop him, of course!  You get all the Bat gadgets, plus some cameos from the vehicles.  You get to beat the living daylights out of the Joker's henchmen.  You get to take on some of your favorite villains (though I was sorely disappointed that the Riddler was absent; you spend much of the game trying to solve his riddles--to unlock content--but he's not actually in the game).  You get to use the Detective Mode to find clues and weaknesses.  And the voice cast--featuring Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill from the classic cartoon series that I was fortunate enough to grow up with--is spectacular; the cinematic scenes (many of which actually require you to move your character) look and feel just like a movie.  I would pay money to watch somebody play this video game.  The scenes leading up to the Scarecrow encounters are perhaps the best--the first and third are absolutely terrifying (I got chills, I really did), and the second is just plain haunting.  They don't pull any punches here.  There are a few negative things, of course; at certain times, you have to multitask; I can't count the number of times I got shot in the back trying to hack into security doors.  Of course, I solved the problem by taking out the armed guards first (duh!), but the problem is there: like any game of this type, you don't have complete control over the camera.  It'll come back to haunt you.  And while the Detective Mode is spectacular, you often spend too much time in it, thus missing out on the amazing scenery of the game; I found myself saying to hell with the mission, and just walking around enjoying the stellar graphics.  I can't tell you if this is the best Batman game out there, though I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest it is.  If there's a better game, then I really need to play it.

With some of the others it is just about impossible to get it on there cleanly and one particle of dust makes a rather large bubble under the filter. The Hori filter is thick enough to re-apply more than once so if a mote of dust gets in there you can peel it back and use a bit of tape to pull the dust off. You can then press the filter back down with no problems. I wouldn't recommend trying the tape trick on those cheaper and thinner screen protectors. You will mangle them.  Also, since the Hori screen filter is thicker, it protects better. If you get it on there right after getting a PSP, it will remain scratch free indefinitely. I have used three of these so far.

The ear clip style does not isolate environmental noise. It's a typical behind the neck design for you to hang your headphones on your neck when not in use.  The connection uses a standard 3 pin 3.5 mm stereo headphone with mic, which is the same as the iPhone's wired headset or other mobile phones, so this can be used not only on PSP but mobile phones.  The worse part is the length of the headset combining with the remote.  The remote no doubt is stylish but also considered as bulky.

I read some of the other reviews below and heard about how this game isn't compatible with some graphics cards or whatever. If that were the case, I'd haved to give this game one star. But since this game did run perfectly well on my machine, here's what I have to say about it. The only space sim that I've played other than Tachyon is X-Wing--an old VGA game--but in many ways X-Wing was the turning point in space sims. The graphics in Tachyon are really good, if somewhat redundant. What I mean is that sometimes I see the same patterns and textures on space stations. Speaking of space stations, I was MOST IMPRESSED by their SIZE. The people at Novalogic really did an outstanding job at scaling things correctly. But what really got me to buy this game was the fact that you could buy different ships and decide what armament and upgrades you want to put on it. Certain ships have a certain amount of slots, and the possible combinations are nearly endless. Another nice feature is that you can own multiple ships at once, or sell individual ships or parts for money. You can hire wingmen to assist you on missions. Since there is no in-flight camera, it's hard to tell if your wingmen did anything to help you, but at least they don't die easily--even the poorer pilots. There are several external view, but I didn't find them very helpful. They should have put a gunsight on the external view so that you could fly through the mission, accomplish it, and enjoy the scenery at the same time. The game is sorta nonlinear. You get to choose which level mission you want to undertake, but ultimately you will end up doing the others. The missions are fairly simple and varied, which is nice. I remember that X-Wing was downright frustrating at times. By the way, there are cheats for this game, so if you get stuck, look 'em up. The levels with the fog are interesting, although they can be a strain on the eyes and disorientating at times. But that's not until the end. There are some cut-scenes, but nothing truly original or amazing--they're still the in-game graphics. This game could have been better, but overall I'd say it's worth its price.

I ended up starting it over and skipping through conversations and puzzles catching up quickly to where the glitch was.  I didn't have any problem with the hammer glitch after that, I guess because I followed a certain order to the game.  The extra ending in this ""Collectors Edition"" made up for all the trouble. I can't imagine the story ending without the alternate ending. Plus the deluxe strategy guide that comes with the collectors edition is very helpful.  I loved the game.

1197,64052,5,False,"05 12, 2005",A3EK57ZHMA55G5,B0007UDYUQ,Lestor neeker Wong,"I made an impulsive decision yesterday by buying the PSP. Just in case you didn't know, I'm from Singapore, and Sony only officially launched the""ultimate portable gaming console"" at this part of the world yesterday. I walked past the shop, took a look at the demo, and took out my credit card.  Going home together with me is the inaugural title for the PSP, the racing classic Ridge Racer. I've played the game on my wife's colleague's parallel-imported PSP some months ago, and was pretty impressed by the look of things. But it was only when I had the time to finally take on the game on a more prolonged duration, that I fully appreciate the beauty of it. And it is, as I mentioned, just beautiful.  The thing that immediately captures your attention is obviously the graphics. Fantastic is an understatement when it comes to how good Ridge Racer looks. Even when you're primarily focused on the road while racing, you can't help but notice the amazingly detailed background. For one, your races will take you thought different hours of the day, which means you'll come across the brightness of the day, as well as the cosiness of sunset. During different courses, you may also notice an airplane flying above you; or see yourself driving past an awe-inspiring lake; or a crowd of spectators cheering you on... you get the idea.  The graphics also put a lot of emphasis on speed. So when you're bursting down the road at 240km/h in a tunnel, you'll find the background fading away in a blur to create a sense of speed. The best part, however, is that the frame rate never seems to skip a beat despite the extensive graphics. Having the screen freezing for moments while I go side-by-side with a rival car in other racing games (such as Burnout) on the PS2 is definitely not a problem for the PSP and Ridge Racer.  You've a few options to approach the game, while single events like Single Race and Time Attack may be a good training ground for newbies, you'd expect to spend most of your time unlocking new tracks and cars in the World Tour mode. The earlier tours are relatively easy to pass, but from what I heard, it just get tougher as it goes, so expect to redo races a lot of times as you progress. Oh, and did I mention you can have a wireless racing session with your friends if they also own the PSP?  The controls are relatively standard. You've the X button for acceleration, and Square Button for brakes. If you're using the manual gear, the Triangle button shifts a gear up, and the Circle Button shifts a gear down. The ""L"" button switches between first and third person view, and the ""R"" button activates the nitro you earn while doing power drifts during corners. Oh, and you also control the direction using the D-Pad, but I'm sure you already know that. The controls make reduce the need for any tedious learning curve, and make sure that you can start right away to do the thing that you bought the game. That is, to play!  Now, the next big thing for this game. The audios. If you're played earlier renditions of Ridge Racer, you should have knowledge of how cool the soundtrack, er, sounds. You get some rehashed tracks, as well as new tracks that really make it a joy to listen while you take on the competition. You'll also get to select from different playlists, so you're by no means stuck with what you don't like. An archive is also available for you to listen to remixes of old Ridge Racer tracks. Now, for the nostalgic fan, this is really a cool idea.  On the whole, Ridge Racer is a testament to how good a game can be on the PSP. If you're not a Ridge Racer fan, you may not enjoy it as much as those who're. Still, you can't deny that the graphics and audios in this game are worth another look. It's a pity that the sound couldn't do better, due to the limitations of the console itself. Listening to music on the PSP without earphones is like listening to a badly tuned FM receiver in my opinion, but then again, earphones are provided!

Washington,"I held off on doing a review on this game because I wasn't really sure if I would like it, and I didn't want to do like many and give a bad review because I didn't understand or get into it deep enough.  This game is awesome Plain and simple.  Its not perfect because like many games, when they get so complex and detailed, sometimes the control mechanics can be cumbersome and takes some adapting to use the controls. I have seen where people are saying its a combination of Grand Theft Auto and Assassins Creed.  I can see why this comparison is made, but this game is much BETTER than both for a few reasons. The first reason is that it is not a sequel series.   I am a firm believer that game sequels have a tendency to go stale unless they are online multiplayer formats. The whole hacking genre of this game is pretty sick. Like I said, it took a few missions to really get into it, but I am getting addicted to it quickly.   The free roam capability that is comparable to GTA is much more advanced. I think the next generation development has allowed the game to literally allow the player to go where they want. The interactive environments are really awesome. You knock trash cans over when you are running through alleys, you can drive through chain link fences when eluding police, etc. Thats another thing, The police pursuits are exciting! The cops aren't as easy to outrun like they are in GTA. The AI is far superior.  You have to rely on the expanding free roam environment and hacking into traffic systems to get away.  Which brings up the issue of controlling vehicles. The vehicle driving mechanics could be better, and I find myself losing perspective when hitting high speed turns because the camera angle puts you in blind spots. When you make vehicles crash behind you, the slow motion camera capture of the crash is cool to watch, but the down side when the perspective returns to you, you can sometimes crash yourself because the view returns you to a bad spot. But I can live with this because the game has so many strengths that outweigh this. My solution is to use the available motorcycles. They are smaller and more nimble and easier to get through traffic . Not to mention, its easier to ride a motorcycle between barriers that you trigger during police pursuits.  The hacking puzzles are top notch, and makes the hacking theme seem more realistic. And people need to realize that Watch Dogs is not some boring hacking puzzle game. It is packed with high paced shootouts which are reminiscent of Max Payne on PS3, but with next gen detail. The graphics are amazing. The roads and sidewalks have cracks and stains and the leaves on the trees, the rain drops and the appearance of the roads when they are wet.

It also had some really great voice talents, writing, and music. I was genuinely frightened during a few parts of the game, biting my nails in anticipation. I have not played ""Post Mortem"", which is somewhat of a prequel to this game. That ended up being perfectly fine, because you actually get to play as the character from that game, who is the grandfather of our modern day character, Victoria. Victoria McPherson is an intelligent and motivated character that I liked listening to and controlling very much. There were only two times when I became overly frustrated with this game, but they were trivial anyway...Victoria some times gets stuck walking in place behind objects, but you can just re-click to your destination and its all good.

1221,80579,5,False,"11 6, 2006",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000F5IH2I,Cloud,"I'll use the old cliche: RPG's have been hand in hand with Final Fantasy. In fact, there's even best-of lists devoted to non-Final Fantasy games. As such, it's hard to believe we haven't had a proper entry in the series since 2001 with Final Fantasy X. Yeah we had the online XI but really, who actually can afford all those fees and everything just to play the game? The twelth game in the series had a frustratingly long gestation period with numerous delays, people walking out as well as doubts about whether the game would actually be good. Must be tough for those who doubted the game. I don't know whether people will regard this as one of the series best but as it stands, this is probably the best RPG available right now.  Story: Taking place in the world of Ivalice, the Archadian Empire has taken over the kingdom of Dalmasca, placing it under their rule. The story centers around a group of people who are caught up in political intrigue and mystery as well as the protection of Princess Ashe, the heir to the throne. As for this story, you might not respond in the way you did to Cloud and Aeris or Locke and Celes but the characters are endearing and the plot is definately the maturest they've done since VIII but what hurts the story is development. You can tell the emphasis was on the story as opposed to the characters so while they all go on this mission, there's really no personal interest in each other as a group. I will say though that I quite like Ashe's character and Balthier is the kind of sly cool guy we all wish we could be.  Graphics: When X came out, the graphics quite frankly stunned me. They still do. Here, they stun but the novelty as worn off since they're not new but boy do they impress. The demo and intro movie are just gorgeous and the in-game cinematics are handled well. This is also probably one of the most fully-realized worlds I've seen. Everything here looks like it has a story to tell or a history and it's very easy to get immersed in. My one knock is that on my widescreen TV, there's actually space that's not used since it's for subtitles and the like and let's face it, with a story like this, you kinda need subtitles.  Sound/Music: Done now by Hitoshi Sakimoto of Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, I find his music well composed and arranged and he's great at using an orchestra but his problem is melodies, or shall we say, lack of them. Revisiting the soundtrack independent of the game made me appreciate some tracks more (the Esper Battle theme is power by definition really) but some tracks go through a few changes that while fine in the game, they're so overwritten it hurts the replayability. As for the voice acting, it's hit and miss. Sure characters like Basch and Balthier and especially Ashe work though she sounds slightly older, but then we have whiny Vaan(show you bad it is, Tidus to me outdoes this guy) and Fran has the most peculiar accent. Ultimately though their voices don't take you out of the game, they're just not as well cast in certain roles.  Gameplay: The straw that might break the camel's back for some people. It used to be that you'd roam the field and whoosh! be met with battle music and the fight than a separate screen for your spoils such as EXP and Gil. Not here. The enemies appear on the field and you just walk right up to them and fight them right there. It's still ATB based so if you pick a command, a bar fills and once it fills, that command is issued. Exp and LP (license points) pop up above your enemy so you don't go to a separate screen. Only problem with this is that sometimes enemies overwhelm you and the EXP jumps rather considerably as you level up. In the first few enemy-infested levels you traverse, your requirements for levelling up can easily jump 300 exp and when each individual enemy has maybe 10 or so, that's a lot of fighting, and your Cure and whatnot don't come fast enough. The camera can cause problems, especially in dungeons where you went left instead of turning right.  Like every single game since probably V, the game introduces a gameplay system on how to level and manage your characters. From the Materia system to Junctioning to the Sphere Grid, every game has had a different approach and it's the same thing here. The License board is essentially a re-worked Sphere Grid. Beating enemies in battle nets you License points which can be used to ""buy"" licenses, such as the ability to equip certain equipment or spells or enhancements such as increased potency of potions and spells or simply raising your strength and increasing your HP. However, just because you bought that license doesn't mean you can use it. Certain things like spells and skills have to be bought as well so buying the Cure license doesn't mean you can cast it, you have to buy it first. To be honest, this works better than X's system because unlike that system where you had to level up your health, strength, defense etc, individually, your traditional levelling up does it for you while the licenses are merely bonuses. However, there's no thieves/white mages-type thing here so you can actually make characters all equip bows if you wanted which takes away a bit of their uniqueness.  The other addition is the Gambit system. Basically these are ""if commands"" which state that if a certain condition is there, an action is performed by your character. For example: if a character falls below a certain health percentage, your character or an ally will automatically perform Cure. If there's a fire-based enemy, you can have your ally automatically cast Blizzard. You can also set order preference so curing and health management take priority over attacking for example. Some say that it later makes the battles easier but personally it makes it funner and considering that they're all controllable, it's fun to not have to worry about them.  Money has been changed as well. Enemies no longer carry vast amounts of Gil in their pocket, but instead they carry treasures. They can carry furs, stones and such and then those are sold in the market. Also you can take on various bounties where you hunt down a creature. It works in theory as well as just simple common sense(how is it that a bat carries Gil and what for anyway?), you don't get as much money as you should, especially considering you have to buy spells as well as techniques, weaponry, protective garments as well as supplies. As for the difficulty? It can get quite hairy. One early boss encounter pitted me up against at least 6 enemies, 2 of which were the main enemies and boy did they pack a wallop, finished me in 2 minutes flat. Party management and levelling are a must if you're to survive.  I don't think there even is a Final Fantasy that's absolutely perfect but it's probably still going to be one of the more impressive RPG's you've played and XII is no different.","Well, here goes...",1162771200,12.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,cure non-final power weaponry gambit maybe i've jump attack rpg's enhancement consider come stand theme protection fight cast approach whiny market supply subtitle revisit fine actually traditional frankly replayability individually walk problem get point thing sure buying different later kinda traverse ability role fun really doubt enemy orchestra command camel's tell sphere hunt right basch increase believe kind easy bit screen miss frustratingly difficulty would fully-realized re-worked everything track bad hitoshi carry work jump requirement hit easily tv demo ultimately main fantasy pocket devote set sound/music finish mean gameplay entry system board boy fight political go center delay example do they're place every fran emphasis wish guy camera amount know away potion hard intrigue much xi heir theory character they've hp plot level like whoosh sell soundtrack immerse graphic level development could come character take princess might health spell group perform cliche problem compose raise state issue money well long thieves/white preference oppose see twelth intro one manage personally new change priority definately list net make impressive novelty gorgeous let's first overwritten turn certain bow impress balthier condition tactic handle various history buy etc game also still anyway outdoes proper voice fur bat license numerous caught kingdom appreciate appear melody since celes story old accent though battle take hairy merely there's gestation materia tough cause use treasure empire mages-type personal ashe's he's rather fall gil uniqueness play command i'll hand use yeah work break long world introduces license automatically order ally potency cloud however mission xii simply interest need think independent rule least enough voice take regard protective slightly throne creature considerably want must go straw music leave thing percentage meet face series lot mature ashe back fill place grid vaan(show shall separate enemy act pack good single online use worn endear respond whether game beat sly early common cinematics cure sometimes level bos fee strength blizzard period fast viii stone buy make junctioning knock field dalmasca garment pit best doubt equipment tidus management x's well individual say final defense peculiar widescreen look perform pop find quite ivalice way stun enemy-infested space movie funner world perfect controllable action whatnot aeris vagrant vast pick addition great simple take bar minute unlike archadian that's fact play change walk technique mystery atb go afford definition sound esper probably spoil lp wallop lack skill equip cool in-game stun especially exp bounty sense(how best-of honest even battle arrange hurt easy increase basically locke rpg encounter around worry instead fire-based make party bonus flat people dungeon essentially available base roam survive carry older absolutely overwhelm sakimoto

1234,307110,3,False,"12 1, 2013",A2Q5OE6Q9OIVOO,B00CXCCB64,DoggyDaddy,"**August 2014 Update**:  I'm cautiously taking my review back from one to three stars.  I'm playing BF4 again via EA Access (which is the way I would recommend anyway, $5 is certainly worth a one month trial, if you don't want to pony up for a $30/year).  So far many of the bugs I noticed before are gone, but I still need to take it through its paces with friends.  Very disappointed in BF4.  I'm a big fan, but I just can't sit by as EA and DICE release what feels like the buggiest Battlefield ever shipped.  The graphics on Xbox One are very nice and this game truly feels next gen, but I experienced in just a few hours of playing:  audio dropouts, quick match not connecting me to the right servers, frequently servers would pop up and request another $50 for premium upgrade, getting kicked out of servers, crashing back to the home (only X1 game I'm having this problem with) and a complete lack of any functionality to group up in a party/squad pre-game.  I'd love to be playing BF4 right now, but the reason I get it is for multiplayer gaming with friends an it is absolutely unfit and broken for that purpose.

This modern take on the famous franchise takes inspiration from many great sources- my first impression, oddly enough, was of ""Resident Evil 4"" (a classic so significant, it's still influencing the gaming landscape). The early goings of ""Tomb Raider"" have a distinctly ""survival horror"" vibe that is masterfully conveyed, interspersed with just the right amounts of Quick Time Events, cinematic showpieces, character development, story telling, and gameplay tutorials. Additionally, it reminded me of the fantastic island of the TV show, ""Lost"" (complete with freaky natives and bunkers!).  The most striking comparison, of course, is that of the ""Uncharted"" series. ""Tomb Raider"" obviously existed long before ""Uncharted"", but it's equally obvious that it drew inspiration from the mechanics of climbing, combat, and cinematic storytelling of one of this generation's most successful series. And I'm not complaining at all- I wish there were more games like ""Uncharted""! For the most part, ""Tomb Raider"" does a fantastic job implementing these elements, resulting in a game that is a blast to play and easy to pick up. Everything is very responsive, the settings are visually vibrant and interesting, and the island is begging for more thorough searching. The inclusion of TONS of unlockables is a genius notion, including documents (which help to further unfurl the mystery of the island), artifacts, and salvage (for weapon and gear upgrades), and it means crazy amounts of replay value... plus the online multiplayer aspect, if that strikes your fancy.  The only thing holding ""Tomb Raider"" back is that when pitted up against the unrivaled production values of ""Uncharted"", it falls a shade short. The characters are noticeably lacking compared to the likes of Nathan, Sully, and Elena, and the presentation just seems a bit ""off"". There's such an emphasis placed on (literal and figurative) darkness and grittiness, I oftentimes had difficulty seeing what was going on around my character, and it actually had something of a demoralizing effect (particlarly when compared to the bright, tropical locales of ""Uncharted""). That's not to say that ""Tomb Raider"" is a bad game- it's not. In reality, it's a very good game- it's just not among my top favorites.  Final note (MINOR spoilers follow): The producers of this game must be huge fans of the movie ""The Descent"", for there are many nods to the horror film, including Lara's affinity for the climbing axe, the ""bone scramble"" toward daylight in the opening moments, and the slow emergence from the red pool of ichor in ""the pit"". Additionally, Lara's psychological transformation closely mirrors that of ""The Descent""'s protagonist. It was an excellent source to draw inspiration from, and the developers of ""Tomb Raider"" did a fine job of subtly paying homage to it.",An awesome game for fans of Uncharted and The Descent (the horror movie),1391040000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,"mirror fall literal demoralize like combat crazy much i've bright uncharted gear character emergence remind like red bunker value influence nod event movie noticeably slow document unrivaled development evil among significant character spoiler fine actually going daylight value moment presentation successful striking reality job strike toward interspersed horror showpiece notion multiplayer weapon aspect follow spent modern franchise many thing enough locale open take pick ton seem something great tomb element equally impression mean descent""'s must fan psychological obviously genius source long additionally place interesting exist huge minor thing mechanic homage draw resident that's course obvious storytelling one play inspiration part series blast transformation back figurative grittiness right survival implement source visually compare mystery vibe favorites hold replay developer go lose good unlockables unfurl quick online sully tell inclusion tropical first island effect pit bit result game affinity freaky early nathan draw help time native search game difficulty descent particlarly cinematic fantastic top everything reboot bad conveyed game lara's scramble bone pay still complete generation's production ichor vibrant oftentimes easy fancy tv upgrade masterfully responsive plus never producer short lack raider play pool i'm darkness around pitted classic story axe subtly gameplay shade beg excellent include take elena tutorial distinctly comparison there's closely protagonist landscape famous setting salvage oddly say show note see final thorough climb artifact emphasis complain wish amount film"

1252,116921,4,False,"10 2, 2007",A1QA8K3LD9K892,B000UZVL9Y,Chris Adamson,"The sixth DDR released in North America for the PlayStation 2, ""Supernova 2"" isn't the best choice for the PS2 owner (that would be the previous ""Supernova""), nor the second best (that would be ""DDR MAX 2""), but it's a solid third place.  What it does right, it largely inherits from its prececessor.  What it does wrong can be squarely laid on the shoulders of its music producers and licensers.  By this point, pretty much everyone in gaming knows DDR, so a summary of basic gameplay can be skipped.  The key is how the game is presented and what varieties are available.  In addition to the basic arcade-style game, Supernova offered solid ""advanced"" games such as a versus mode, the best exercise mode the series has ever known, and then sabotaged it with the aggravating ""Stellar Master Mode"", a confusing mission mode that had to be completed to unlock over a third of the game's soundtrack and all the extra modes.  Supernova 2 simplifies this with a ""Hyper Master Mode"" which at least allows players to progress more quickly through unlocking new stuff.  However, it shares the same dubious design decision as Stellar Master Mode: most of the challenges change the nature of the game, sometimes radically (arrows are rearranged, superimposed, invisible, move at confusing speeds, etc.).  Given how much effort has to be invested in these Master modes to unlock much of the soundtrack and gameplay, you wonder: what's the real game, arcade mode, or Master mode?  It's as if ""Madden NFL 2008"" only offered the NFC teams at the start, and made you play silly quarterback challenges and punt/pass/kick contests to unlock the AFC, team-by-team.  Fortunately, Hyper Master Mode is a lot easier to beat, since you can buy ""support modules"" to help you clear difficult challenges.  For example, if a challenge requires you to hit a certain number of combos, a module that turns ""good""s into ""great""s will keep your combos going.  So you're less likely to hit a brick wall in Hyper Master Mode than in the previous game's Stellar Master Mode.  But it's still annoying to have to invest so much time in this mode at all.  I exercise with DDR every day, and I appreciate how good Supernova's exercise mode was, and am grateful it is copied lock, stock, and barrel for Supernova 2.  You can maintain multiple profiles and histories for exercise players, protect them with passwords, and design your own custom exercise courses (also possible in MAX 2, but not in the ""Extreme""s).  The catch is that you need to start unlocking songs quickly to build a tolerable workout.  Supernova 2's default song list contains a lot of low-speed R&B and slow pop from popular performers like Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, etc.  Some of the licensed songs, like Chris Brown's ""Say Goodbye"" and especially Gwen Stefani's ""Wind It Up"" are particularly ill-suited to DDR-style dancing.  There are licensed songs that work in this format, like Fatboy Slim's ""The Rockafeller Skank"", but sadly, they're the exception.  Doing a workout of 17 all-random songs, on ""basic"" for the first and last and ""difficult"" otherwise, I found I was only burning 350 calories, compared to 450 for similar workout schedules on Supernova.  Only after unlocking the usual DDR J-pop suspects like Be For U, Riyu Kosaka, Naoki Maeda, Anettai Maji-Ska Bakudan, etc., could I get the speed to a point where it was interesting and valid exercise.  So, full points for taking the best of Supernova, addressing the worst problems of Stellar Master Mode (though a timed unlock system, ala MAX 2, would have been preferable), but points off for terrible taste in licensed music.  It shouldn't be your first DDR game, but if you're already playing the series and want more, it's not a bad choice.  UPDATE:  After two and a half months, a chunk of the disc broke off while returning the disc to its case.  I contacted Konami customer support and even though I'm within the 90-day warranty period, they refused to honor the warranty and replace the defective disc.

1257,214310,4,False,"08 12, 2013",A2O57JZY4E47EK,B003O6EATE,Keri Ellis,"Let me preface this review by saying that I did not buy a new Vita from Amazon. I was very apprehensive about buying one due to ""lack of games"" and overpriced memory cards so I bought a second hand unit.  I'm sad I didn't purchase this system sooner because I am loving it! Yes, a good majority of the retail games are ports; however, the real gems of the Vita library are digital. For example, games like ""Sound Shapes"", ""Dokuro"", and ""Urban Trial Freestyles."" There are many more on my wish list that I haven't played yet, so can't recommend, like ""Mutant Blobs from Space"" and ""Guacamelee.""  Having a primarily digital library brings me to my second point of apprehension, the memory cards. Yes, they are expensive, and unfortunately there is no way around paying that high price as long as Sony continues to be the sole manufacturer. The best advice I have is to get one on sale or from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I bought a 32gb card and don't regret springing for the most expensive card. The way I see it, if you don't, you'll be likely to run out of space on your current card and either be forced to purchase another card (and ultimately be spending the same amount as you would have if you just bought a more expensive card in the first place) or delete games off of your memory card. If you're someone who likes to have a lot of games on hand, deleting games is a bummer.  Speaking of the digital library, if you own this system and are NOT a member of Playstation Plus, go become a member immediately! There are so many free games that Sony is giving out that you are doing yourself a disservice if you own a vita and are not a member of Playstation Plus.  On the design side of things, I really like the analog sticks. Although they can feel a bit loose, the texture on top is excellent. The PSP analog stick would hurt my thumb after a while because of the ridges on top, but the Vita's are nice and smooth.  Another pro to mention is the battery life. While I'm not sure about a long gaming session since I only play 20-30 minutes at a time, I can say that the standby time is excellent. I can leave it in sleep for a few days and it still has charge. That's pretty good in my book!  There are some cons to this system, which prompted the 4/5 stars. For starters, Sony must really hate people who bite their fingernails because two out of the three system ports are closed by covers that require a fingernail or thin object to open. The cartridge slot is one of these ports, which makes me glad that the majority of my games are digital.  My second con is that the system software is still a bit buggy. My system has locked up on multiple occasions when I tried to download a game either directly after starting up the PS store, or directly after downloading another game.  To summarize, even though I have a few quibbles,  this is still an excellent system. It has plenty of games (most of them digital) for all gamers, is comfortable to play, and has pretty good battery life.

I haven't had any problems with the lag since the update, and they fixed the common mission glitches that this game use to have there may still be more but I haven't run into any others.  I will cover the limited edition items before the gameplay since thats the version I am reviewing. The statue is oh my god awesome, it looks great and is a nice addition to my dragon statues. The art book that it comes with has some great art in it that goes over quite a bit of stuff. The Bonus of DVD I haven't actually watched yet since whenever i look at Skyrim i go straight for the game.  Now I was a HUGE fan of Oblivion I put so many fun filled hours into that game and I must say Skyrim is even more awesome than that. It is improved in so many ways. Obviously the graphics are greatly improved the world is just beautiful. The combat is also improved from Oblivion. The Story was just fantastic a bit short but this game has SOOOO many side quests that even after putting over 300 hours into the game I still haven't completed everything. The game has practically all the guilds Oblivion had, it has the mages guild, the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood, and the companions is practically the fighters guild.  They took a few things out, nothing extremly dissapointing though. You can't create your own spells anymore. There is no greaves in this game the cuirass and greaves are just one set of armor, most people im sure wouldn't care but it kinda bugged me. Another thing that im sure most people wouldn't mind is your armor and weapons don't get damaged in this game, I kinda liked that option but I do kinda like it this way so my weapon does't break in battle.  They added some awesome stuff like Smithing, you can create your armor and weapons in the game you may also sharpen your weapons to make them stronger or enhance your armor at a workbench. You can get married, not an amazing option but its pretty cool to do. And quite a bit more cool stuff has been added.  The level up system is definitley better, now every skill level up will go towards a character level not just level up your major skills. You get a perk for every level up you obtain in the game which you can put into whatever skill you want and get different perks for the skills other then set perks depending on your skills level... I probably didn't explain that too well.  I don't have anything bad to say about this game now that the pack has been released. I would definitley recommend this game to any action rpg lover out there i don't see how anyone can be dissapointed by this masterpiece. Its easily one of the best games I have EVER played, I have been playing for the last few months and i'm still having fun with Skyrim.  So yeah this is a must have game.",Simply AMAZING!!!

You have a lot of options to build up your city and the fun ability to import Sims from Sims 1 or drive around in a variety of different vehicles.  The graphics are also the best up to date although you're still stuck in an isometric view.  Luckily, you can rotate the camera and even look at the city during the day or night.  For those that are used to SimCity, it won't be any surprise at the things you can build.  The things you can build are roads, highways, railroads, elevated rails, monorails, commercial, industrial, residential, entertainment, fire, police, etc...  Everything you possibly need to create a thriving city!  You also have the ability to conduct trade with other cities on your border.  Some downsides are the fact that while trade is cool, it has no effect on the other city.  You have a huge map that you play on and little plots of land you cultivate into your city.  You can make a trade sending all your garbage to a neighboring city and when you play as that city, they don't have any such deal.  It kind of ruins the realism since ideally, you could have sent all your trash to one place, got your power from another, etc.  There is also a problem with the graphics.  At a certain point, the game will begin to chug, and no matter what your computer specs are, it will continue to chug.  It kind of ruins the late game.

I thought this game was initially a survival DOOM type game but after many hours found out it is a civilization sand box game as well.  Thanks to the internet I located some key commands like hooking up electricity and assigning people to tasks for their communities.  That whole aspect of the game is hugely and surprisingly fun. What makes the game truly great is finding rare weapons and giving them a try on the myriad of skilled AI opponents.  My favorite thing in this game is the endearing German shepherd dog that helps you along the way, yes there are other companions but it's this dog that entertains me while wondering the wasteland encountering fringe communities.  I'm having the hardest time putting this game down now.  I can see why my millennial friends were loving this game a year ago while I was lukewarm.

1274,56254,4,False,"05 14, 2014",AWAGSXM9CNZCC,B00023XXMC,An Android Fan,"I purchased the original back when it first came out and found the first expansion, To D'ni, but never got the second one and eventually lost the CD. So when I decided to get this game on GOG I already knew what to expect for most of it even though most of my memories of the moment to moment gameplay had been eroded by a decade. I still remember first looking at the outside area in Gahreesen on my first playthrough, being blown away by the scenerly. Before everything was enclosed, mechanical and broken. Now I had a view that would take one's breath away.  Unfortunately, what I hadn't remembered so well (until I started playing it this weekend) was the ludicriously long wait for the rotating tower, or how easy it was to miss the jump when it finally was time to do so, thanks to the clunky controls.  Which, to be honest, is a good summation of my experience with the game. I am, have been and always will be a fan of the Myst series, and Uru is probably my favorite game of them all. The Ages are beautifully crafted and original; none of them feel like they were copied and pasted from past games. The lore of the series is rich and powerful. There are little nods to previous entries, especially at the end of Path of the Shell. Yeesha speaks with conviction about the D'ni, compelling the player to help restore the civilization. Yet for all of its strengths, it bumbles through so much. It makes what could be a great experience a good one, and a good experience a fair one.  For example, when I was opening the first 4 ages in Relto in the base game, I saw the link to Eder Gira and thought, ""I remember hating this Age. I remember being really, really frustrated with it. I should probably get this one done and out of the way"" but I couldn't remember my issue with it.  And a few minutes later I slipped off an edge and linked back to Relto. After doing this a few times in an attempt to get through the Age, my thought was, ""I REMEMBER NOW!!!"" That, of course, was before I got to the fairy segment - oh, that freaking fairy segment. To call it ludicriously tedious would be an understatement. I breathed a sigh of relief when it was at last over.  But my experience with tedium was far from over. In addition to that experience I had with jumps in Gahreesan I mentioned above, it seems like the devs for the expansion packs got together and said, ""Now okay, this won't be a proper Myst game if we don't have at least one segment of busywork for the player."" For ""To D'Ni"" it was finding all those coordinates for the Great Zero Machine, for PotS, it was that freaking Ahnonay Age that required multiple cycles before finally getting  to its fourth, final form. Then of course, are at least 3 segments, also in Path of the Shell, where you are required to wait for 15 minutes of real time. Just wait. One of them has a vital clue you need which can only be triggered at the end of the 15 minute wait and if you're not there when it happens, you miss it. 45 minutes of doing nothing is just padding the game artificially. Come on Cyan; you're better than this!  And one other thing: In TD, I didn't really feel like the game was guiding me well. In the base game, the game establishes very early that you're to find the Journey cloths; they're both bookmarks in your current journey/story and you always knew how many you had to find. In TD, i more or less stumbled through what I was trying to do, finally breaking down and consulting a playthrough to figure out what it was the game expected of me. I didn't get that feeling so much in PotS, but there was still less direction than Uru itself (and freaking Ahnonay.....)  Now, for the most part, Uru is definitely a great time and I would most definitely recommend it for fans of the series and fans of point and click adventure games in general. She's a great game who laughs at your jokes, compliments you daily and she'll make you a steak dinner just because. Just understand that underneath the beauty lie a few crippling failings that test your patience with her.  The game is a good one-shot, but once you've played through it once you've seen everything it can offer. A second playthrough will yield no new surprises nor places to explore. I will never give this game up, as it will always have a place in my heart, but it's not the kind of game I would play to kill some time just because I'm bored.  Graphics: Great (both for its time and today) Sound: Beautiful music, believable FX, draws you in Controls: Clunky at first, easier to manage in First Person Gameplay: Solid, if irritating in places. Also difficult to figure out what the game expected of you from time to time. Replayability: Not much once you've found everything, really.

1276,187021,4,False,"01 27, 2010",ALC6LWQXBHIPG,B001TORSII,Dredded Deuce,"I am so far so blown away by Mass Effect 2. I will say that first off, while you can start a new character w/o having to play part 1, you will get more out of the story if you have already played part 1.  **SPOILER ALERT!**  First off moving your character save is a breeze and even with the prologue, you can still go back in and tweak your character's appearance and class if you weren't too happy with what you had in ME1.  As far as the controls are concerned, it's come a good little ways since the first one as you have more of a Gears of War approach as this game is more combat heavy and tactical heavy. A lot of the inventory has been streamlined to help the player enjoy the game more and worry less about equipping your character.  The story itself so far is also engrossing. Sheppard and crew are facing off against a threat of the Collectors while at the same time working for a mysterious organization call Cerebrus who managed to not only treat her like Ripley in Aliens but also rebuild her ship (once you play it, you will see) you will meet new characters who you will find are hard to trust as well as meet up with old characters that you will have issues with as far as your alliances.  There are also many moments even early on where you get to do things that will cause your paragon or renegate ratings to change based on those action and that includes saving someone or killing someone!  That also is another part to this game. Based on some of your decisions. your crew's loyalty will change. I haven't gotten far yet to see how this works but if it's anything like Dragon Age, I will bet that it's a doozy.  Another major improvement is the art of the game. Out of the places I have been to in the game, a lot of artwork and design of planets, characters, city structures etc, feels as if it's giving Mass Effect 2 it's own identity and not just look like another static Sci fi game. I would comment further on your ship's desing but I think as a player you would have to see it for yourself. I think that even the music is better this time around and the voice dialogue is still top notch like the first.  Even as far as traveling in the game, so far, there is a lot more to do. You can travel to different systems and scan moons to mine for ore from orbit and also you get 2 peices of free DLC which you can use immediately. Also instead of just highlighting a dot and going, you can 'fly' your ship where you want it to be on the map and then tell it to go there. One other small mechanic  you may want to keep an eye on is the fuel gauge as you have to buy gas to get where you are going. That could be a plus or minus depending.  Character leveling as in the first game is not complex at all but you may want to try different classes to get an idea of what you like as newer ones have been added. One of the additions that I like is that you can upgrade weapons, armor and ship systems as well as do some customizing of your own personal equpiment.  There really aren't too many minuses in the game except for one, I don't like the fact that if you are docked in a city or station and you want to get something on your ship, you have to undock (to load your ship's level up) and then redock to continue. This to me breaks the flow of the game. Also in some parts where you are talking to NPCs, the lighting could be a bit off.  Some people may have issues with the new ""Halo style"" damage indicator where you take damage, the screen gets red and then you run off and heal.  I think I liked it the other way from the first one.  But all in all, if you are a fan of this title, pick it up and play it and on a scale of 1 - 5, I give this a 4.5.",An excellent follow up from a new  IP and it's Bioware!,1264550400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,alert player give age fuel away hard notch combat play manage renegate find mysterious use threat character mechanic complex enjoy way save equpiment like immediately red highlighting streamline depend load approach way level sci spoiler tactical desing inventory planet travel could come character someone try moment think scale one action organization ship's war title get paragon upgrade many treat class station gauge system flow change dlc take pick weapon something feel already cerebrus level armor crew's different light mine moon redock artwork well happy less scan music addition appearance little thing really minuses place dragon one fact play collector like part lot new back tell control improvement crew add peices engross fly heal far ship alien free go good city face dialogue talk effect first design major trust w/o bit want map early help time screen call bet orbit would tweak rebuild give top comment part damage issue buy identity etc game also fan still dock works voice even see static start meet fi customize npcs rating art concern except gas idea plus class indicator gotten sheppard loyalty continue style gear since around minus move worry work decision story prologue old yet dot instead breaks look include equip run breeze travel ore new eye character's halo people heavy go alliances well cause mass say base save another get ripley structure may anything personal undock keep kill doozy small blown

1282,161474,3,False,"07 28, 2012",A36B4I68NYSY6N,B0016PZYLS,Rambo,"I own Saints Row 2 as a Playstation Plus member. It is a fun game that is very comparable to Grand Theft Auto IV. But playing the storyline can be a challenge as you are always required to earn enough ""respects"" before you can jump to the next chapter. What that means is you're forced to unnecessarily kill people (bonus if they're gang-affiliated), break all kind of traffic laws, etc. Or you can also do side jobs such as being a paramedic and responds to incidents throughout the city and earn respect that way. Either way, you don't just move on automatically to the next mission. Although I have not completed the gameplay, I believe that I prefer GTA IV (which I haven't finished playing either). There is no question that I like this game. But I strongly believe that developers could have done a better job (I'm assuming improvements were made for the sequel Saints Row the Third, which I don't own yet). One of the biggest disadvantages in this game is driving vehicles. There is only one single camera view when you drive a car, when the camera is behind the entire vehicle. No cockpit view (like in Midnight Club: Los Angeles) or hood view (like in GTA IV and San Andreas). Of course, cars are not licensed (unlike in the Need for Speed series). So you do not see real world brands like Ford and Chevy (I think companies and businesses don't like to be associated with violent games like this). The music selection is very good, however, better than in GTA IV in my opinion. Finally, a game getting closer to reality: there is a cemetery in Stilwater (I even towed a car from there in one of my missions). I couldn't find any in Liberty City (GTA IV). The law enforcement aspect of the game is somewhat OK. I like the fact that developers included female police officers (although I'm reading that there was no such inclusion in the sequel released last year). I still prefer GTA IV police sirens because as a player you have full control over them. In this game, you don't as the yelp and wail sounds activates themselves. There is also no option to keep the flashing lights on when you get out of an emergency vehicle (unless you're playing a diversion with the ambulance). No police horns. On the other hand, you can enter police precincts and explore around. I like the Police Headquarters in the Saints Row district. Ironically, that district seems to be patrolled more by Ultor's armed security officers. Ultor is the business empire that pretty much owns the city, having rescued it when it was cash-strapped following the events of the first Saints Row. Overall, I would say good game, but could have been much better. When I play an open world game, I pay close attention to realism. Saints Row 2 somewhat lives up to my expectation.

1286,47581,5,False,"08 20, 2007",AHCVWPLA1O4X8,B00009WAUO,bixodoido,"Considering the Super Mario Brothers series is widely regarded as one of the best video game franchises ever, the fact that many long time Mario fans call this their favorite Super Mario game should be enough to convince you to try this game.  Super Mario Brothers 3 took the fantastic gameplay elements of the original Super Mario Brothers and improved upon them in many ways.  Several new powerups were added to compliment the mushroom, flower, and star.  These come in the form of 'suits,' and give Mario an array of abilities and forms.  The Raccoon suit, for example, allows Mario to fly, the Tanooki suit lets him turn to stone for a few seconds, and the Hammer Brothers suit allows him to, well, throw hammers.  This is one of the reasons this game remains so popular today--most of the suits are unique to this game, and they're all a lot of fun.  This game also features an overworld map with several stages per ""world.""  Instead of being simply linear like the original Super Mario Bros, players have some choices in the order they play the stages.  There are also bonus squares on the map, which have little mini games that offer powerups (which you can store and use later).  The game allows you to save after passing an airship or a fortress, but this version of it also allows you to save at any point (though you can only continue once from that location) if you have to interrupt play in between save points.  The Game Boy Advance version of Super Mario 3 (which they call Super Mario Advance 4) is a pretty faithful port of the original game.  The graphics and gameplay are essentially the same, which causes fans of the original (like me) to breathe a sigh of relief.  The original soundtrack to the game, which was excellent, remains intact, although Mario's voice (the one that started popping up around the time of Mario 64) pops up from time to time.  Apparently this bothers some people, but I don't find it intrusive or something that hinders the experience.  The game also includes a version of classic Mario Brothers which can be played by up to 4 people.  While I would have preferred to get this on my Wii's virtual console, the idea that I now have a portable version of Super Mario 3 to take with me on the go is pretty exciting.  The price tag may seem a little steep to some, but I consider it worth every penny (even though I have the original NES version).  I'd definitely recommend this title, regardless of if you're a fan of retro video games or if you're a relative newcomer to the Mario series of games.

1288,361914,4,True,"12 9, 2015",A380JKDD0N4P5V,B00KVHSNB0,Echo,"I have been sort of disappointed with the crop of shooters this year. Halo 5's campaign was good, but the multiplayer drove me back to Reach, CoD has failed to seriously interest me since MW3, and SW Battlefront is very good, but feels like it's lacking content and is somewhat difficult to navigate. Enter Rainbow Six: Siege. I played Rainbow Six: Vegas a few years back and enjoyed it, but my lingering memory was the extreme difficulty. And when I say 'difficulty' I mean that stealth, cover and attention to detail played a huge role and foul-ups were immediately and brutally punished. So that was my expectation for the new game, as I did not have a whole lot of information on it. So I got the game. It is truly excellent. True to form, this game places emphasis on careful precision and stealth, rather than sprinting around a map with a grenade launcher. The player spawns with 100 health points, which can be taken down  very quickly and do not regenerate. There are no health pickups. In order to succeed, the player needs to use every tool they have to outwit their enemies. In this regard, you have the ability to blast through walls, ceilings, floors, doors and rappel up and down buildings to your heart's content. Teamwork is also absolutely essential. I do not like talking to random strangers on the internet, but I've had to break that rule for this game. Things really don't work all that well if you do not use a mic. Recently, I got into two groups that I stuck with for some time. 4 out to the 5 of us, in each group, had mics, and every time, the player without the mic was the first to die and made the smallest contribution. So be prepared to work as a team. Even if you are a lone wolf and you decided to do some recon work on your own, make sure you communicate so that your teammates know what's happening. As far as playability goes, I have no complaints. It is somewhat different from other shooters. Upon entering the first Situation (single player training missions) movement is a little slower and a touch less fluid than the likes of CoD, Battlefield or Halo. Same story with the weapons. The weapons in those other games are as solid as anvils by comparison. Weapon aiming is slightly jerky and it can be difficult to line up a perfectly accurate shot. And once you take that first shot, the weapon will stutter with recoil. And the difficulty in aiming plays a role in the more active firefights. You either know precisely where your enemy is and continue to aim for the head in the hope a quick takedown, or you aim for the center of mass, which makes for a slower kill. None of this is a bad thing though. It plays to the hyper realism that is the recurring theme in this game. It is much closer to how weapons and their users would actually behave. Kudos there. Now, I'd like to talk about the graphics and sound briefly. I've seen a few things saying that the graphics are poor. I don't know what to say to that. The graphics are very good. Very detailed without being overwhelming. And the sound. The sound is one of the best things about this game. The sound is incredibly dynamic. I recommend playing on higher volumes, because EVERY movement on the map produces sound and it can be used to learn about your surroundings and give you an advantage. There is no music during matches, but there is no shortage of sound. The environment is an orchestra all its own. As I stated earlier, the game is difficult to master. But it is so exhilarating. The constant sounds of enemy movement, the knowledge of just how fragile your operator is and how long it could take to kill an enemy puts your senses on edge makes for some truly amazing and memorable gameplay. I love it. Lag is virtually non-existent. The only time it shows up is when a match is well and truly broken and both teams have a hard time moving more than two feet at a time. But not all is well. You have to make a Ubisoft account to play online. It's not a big deal, but it was annoying. Online stability is not the best, I've been disconnected from several games and this issue is being widely reported. Also, I stated earlier that Battlefront felt light on content. Siege has the same problem. For all its pro's, it feels a little empty. Your choices for play consist of multiplayer (PvP), solo or team Terrorist Hunt (PvE) and situations, which are solo training missions. And in the first two, the gametype is randomly chosen. But these are all minor problems that can be fixed via patches, updates and DLC.  In the end, I like this game very much. I let one of my friends try it on my console and he liked it so much that he decided to get his own copy so we could play together. And that really is the best way to play: in a team of people you like. I hope this helps.

1289,211466,3,True,"04 25, 2011",A3G4BFD7FN8VF1,B003KM38EK,Marvin Powell,"While I still haven't experienced everything The Sims 3 has to offer, I have put in about three weeks of in-game time on it, and so here is my quick review of it. (I should note, I previously played The Sims 2 on Playstation 2.)  THE PROS:  - Much more detail in creating a Sim, although the body details haven't really improved much.  - MUCH more social interactions. Of course, this would be a given.  - Multi-story homes have now been introduced in the console versions of the game. As well as kids and teenagers.  - You now have a whole town to explore and aren't just stuck on your lot or at home, anymore.  - New career choices.  - You can control what goes on at work (or school) given options. You can make a Sim work hard or slack off, talk to co-workers, suck up to the boss, etc. (You just can't actually DO any work yourself, though.)  - Brand new types of objects, such as Cars, Kids Toys, and other things.  - The console-version-exclusive Karma Powers, which are basically in-game 'cheats' that let you do things like fill all Needs, do better at work, or temporally become really lucky.  THE CONS:  - NO MORE DIRECT CONTROL MODE!!! I can't tell you how much I miss this! I personally hated the 'multi-tasking point & click' mode of The Sims 2 console. This IS a console game, so why no Direct Control? This is especially annoying when I'm at the Library and my Sim grabs a book and automatically sits down at some random spot I don't want to go at (usually in a crowded section around other Sims) because I can't control them!  - You no longer can tell what level you are in a social relationship, anymore. There are no more Social Points in the game and now, you just have to guess where you are in a relationship and how close you are to becoming a friend or Best Friend. It's real annoying.  - You can no longer edit your Sims personality anymore. Sure, you can give them 'ability traits' that sort of substitute the old personality stats, like Friendly makes a Sim very outgoing, Good makes a Sim want to help people and cheer them up, Ambitious makes a sim learn skills quicker and want to get promotions faster, and Good Sense of Humor makes a sim funny. They're okay, but I miss the old way. I wish they could've included both personality systems.  - No Story Mode (from The Sims 2 console version) as well as no 'Sandbox' mode, either. The game is just a free-roam mode with no storyline objectives and no full sandbox creativity.  - You almost ALWAYS start out with the same amount of money (20,000) when making a new Sim, and will ALWAYS have only two choices of homes to move into, even though like, six are available. You can't move into them because you can't afford them. So why even offer them there?  - Less variety of home objects to buy.  - The Career choices are still limited. No being an Actor or Firefighter or Superhero. Although the expansion packs on the PC have somewhat fixed this with the introduction of new jobs, those aren't available for the consoles (though they should've been).  - BIG Con! The game may crash on you, depending on any number of unforseen things you might've done, such as building/filling your house too close to the Fire Code, moving into a new house, or just glitches, etc. The game might freeze/crash, not save or load, etc.  COULD BE EITHER PRO OR CON:  - The game is just way too easy, overall. Karma Powers aside, some things are just too convient. Yeah, I *do* like that I can use the Moodlet Manager to wake a sleepy Sim up seeing as they seem to ALWAYS be drowsy, and even with a good bed, can't stay awake for longer than 16 hours a day. But the Lifetime Rewards points, Skill Milestones, etc. just make the overall experience too easy. There's no challenge in anything, really. It's almost impossible to not get promoted in any given job. All you have to do is show up. It'll just take longer to get promoted than it would if you were trying. Epic Fail seems to be the only way you can not do well in any full-time job. That's kinda why, even with all the perks, I don't like this game as much as Sims 2, as Sims 2 was more challenging, which made it more fun.  Overall, it's a good game, but it's just not as 'fun' as The Sims 2 was. There's no Story Mode or Sandbox Mode here, which means no challenging story objectives and no ability to do whatever you want (without cheats). Also, some of the bugs and glitches actually ruin a lot of things, as well. I love the game, but I've actually gotten used to saving back-up files for my four families in case something happens. So far, I've only had to use one back-up to restore things from a corrupted save file, but still.

Marvel VS Capcom for the PlayStation is an example of one of those 2D fighters that needs to be ditched. But don't get me wrong ! I actually liked the game...on the Dreamcast and arcade. The PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just swarming with a whole lot of flaws. Trust me ! This is not arcade perfect ! Most of the times, arcade translations that go to the PlayStation come out imperfect like this one. The graphics are just horrible ! Sure the characters and stages look colorful, but if you pay attention to the framerates of the animations, you'll notice that the characters don't move smoothly or move faster. The audio, sounds great. Music tracks and sound effects are brilliant, but nothing special at all. And as for the gameplay, just horrible. And the lack of a tag feature ? Now this is really going overboard ! Just like in Marvel Super Heroes VS Street Fighter for the PlayStation, you have to call up your character to do a one-hit special move. If you want the tag feature, you'll have use the cross over mode, but this feature doesn't emulate the tag features on the superior arcade and Dreamcast versions. The controls could've been slicker, but instead, it ended up choppy. It seems that the PlayStation controller was not meant for great games like this. All in all, the PSX version of Marvel VS Capcom is a big letdown. Choppy animation, choppy controls, lack of a tag feature, and long loading times during the beginning of each fight really makes this game look like a zero. If you want the real Marvel VS Capcom experience, I'd say buy the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom or spare a few quarters or tokens to play the arcade version. The DC version of Marvel VS Capcom featured flawless animations, awesome graphics, hyper fast controls, no loading times, and a tag feature. Now that's an arcade perfect translation of one of the best 2D arcade fighters of all time ! The DC version is definently worth the money and worth your time ! Please !

1314,234254,4,False,"02 2, 2012",A2JM83X18KJOYC,B004YVOCYG,Gustavo,"Intitially, while I was waiting for the game to come out, I knew that if the developers tried to add too much to this tower, it would eventually fall over. In the case of Revelations, there are some added content which is great, others not so much. Die-hard AC fans have played three games arleady, and most likely exhausted all there is to be given. For Revelations, it still stays true to the classic AC feel. Classic enough that they brought back Altair from the first game of old, but the fact that he has a changed look and voice might disappoint players who have played the game series till this point. I can tell in some dialogue that the actor they put on tried to follow the same format as the original voice of Altair, and cudos to him. Nevertheless, the accent takes away the stoic nature. Now, I don't wish to put out that the game is horrible, I say the contrary.  Story-wise, it is the same but with a new twist towards Constantinople. The story was well put together, with two different main objectives for the story line. The ending, and I speak from my own experience, does bring nostaligic players to some sad moments, but I digress to avoid spoiling it.  Gameplay is pretty much the same as Brotherhood, but vamped up slightly to fit the new disc. You now get a hookblade, which vastly increases freerunning and climbing cabability. Also, challenges for different factions unlock different perks, such as weapons or faction abilities. In fights, it was a job well done. The higher ranking officers do sometimes make a fighter finally take the flight, either for difficulty reasons or it just takes too long and isn't worth it. Otherwise, there are many different types of guards that force the player to adjust in mid-battle. And, of course, along with the good old throwing knives and then the infamous crossbow, you get bombs. You get a good selection of bomb types to choose from, which is a good way to determine a sense of style. The only issue I had hear was with some aspects of gameplay, such as sending assassins to do missions across the country. It is the same thing, but with a little more need to always look at the map and see how annoying it is to keep an area occupied. But Ezio is now a mentor, so that is an excuse.  In regards to combining the first game and the second and thirs game, the developers did a good job. I mainly liked the soundtrack from AC1 and was sort of disappointed that the darkness was sort of taken away onward. But this game does a good job combining both styles music-wise. But, that is just me liking music. The game strongly advertised the ability to play as both Ezio and Altair. What that did is sort of put high expectations on how much you get to play as Altair, when in reality it is less than half of what you can do with Ezio. However, this is still Ezio's game and Altair is looking over the shoulder, so if you want to get Revelations just for Altair round 2, find a different reason.  Multiplayer is still fantastic, and the gameplay has been advance for all good reasons. I say that multiplayer was the best thing that developers had done to continue and add off from Brotherhood.  In conclusios, this is a great game for fans (Assassin noobs may have some trouble following the story obviously). Though the main story is short compaired to its predecessors (Especially AC2), it still satisfied me. I don't give it a 5 star rating only for the little annoyances that got me, but the fun factor is all the way up.

As you can probably tell from the artwork on the case, the game uses pre-made avatars as the characters in the game, though you're not able to use your own avatar which was somewhat disappointing. The main mode of the game is Adventure mode where you play a set number of mini games in order to get medals so that you can move on to the other levels. All of the mini games in the Adventure mode are the same, the only difference is the layout as well as the main goal. For instance, One level may have you collecting a certain number of pins while another level will require you to race through it in a set time limit. There are about 4 different difficulties in Adventure mode. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and The Ultimate Treasure. Each difficulty is locked until you beat the previous one. Beginner is almost like a tutorial letting you get a feel for things while all of the other ones challenge your reflexes and reaction speed.

1325,43946,5,False,"08 9, 2005",A19H56Q031VZKU,B00008KTRS,Stephen J. White,"Digital Devil Saga takes the gamer through a story that ends on a very open, but extremely promising note. On the way to the end though, the gamer will encounter a plethoria of all the right things to make one become immersed in an inovative yet slightly old fashioned experience.  Borrowing a lot from it's ""father"" game Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, the game utilizes a similar combat engine, variety of monsters, and graphics engine. The similarities do not stop there though, and one can imeediatily realize how unmistakable this is as a SMT spin-off. In fact, the game even includes some utilities that can be drawn to other RPG series such as Final Fantasy (the mantra system that the game employes to help the characters learn new skills has a slight similarity to FF6's esper system). Taking these already used mechanics, Atlus has intertwined them togother in such a fashion (and mixed in a puzzling but very good storyline)that makes the gamer wanting even more as the credits come to a close. And that is just where it begins, because this game also takes an interesting step by having a direct follow up sequil!  Digital Devil Saga's storyline kicks off in the middle of a war that is taking place in a strange post apopcalyptic version of earth called ""The Junkyard"". Tribes duke it out in order for one to conquor all the other ones to appease the ruling ""Karma Temple"", which promises to deliver the victorious tribe to a place called Nirvana. Things take a turn for the weirder though, and questions begin to arise all over the place when two tribes (one of which is the tribe lead by the character you will be playing as) discover a bizzare object that sets off an explosion, releasing a virus that causes everyone in the Junkyard to have the ability to transform into a demon... as well as have an insatiable hunger that must be kept in check.  Yes, the game employes canibalism as a pivitol mechanism, you could say, but it does it in such a fashion that you won't even think twice when it's time to devour a helpless enemy who you've slaved away at.  The music of SMT:DDS is really good. Just as it's ""father game"" SMT: N, DDS merges forms of fast paced hard rock with techno, creating a wonderful gaming soundtrack. And it is not limited to only that, as there are also well composed soft pieces for the dramatic moments, and a couple vocal tracks to seal the deal. The sound effects are also very well managed, as they all capture the feel of battle, and help with the addictive manner of slicing an enemy in half and reaping the exp/ap awards. And let's not forget about the voice acting, which is a triumph for SMT here, as it helps add much depth to the game.  Another great feature that DDS has is the plethoria of optional bosses you have to conquor, adding more hours to your gameplay. True, these optional bosses probably will not boost it by much (supposidly the average time for covering the whole game is only about 40-50 hours), but it will leave the gamer satisfied much more, especaly after they duke it out with the ultra difficult boss that they can only encounter on their second play through!  In the end, DDS has it all, despite being a little short on game length. It does have enough loose ends though and potential though that allows the gamer to look immensly towards it's sequil, which is shaping up rather well as of this writing (8/9/05).",Great SMT spin-off,1123545600,7.0,,,combat manage realize megami release earth one follow weirder dd length object direct devour monster demon stop ability mechanic really enemy utility despite turn right yes limited question couple step post variety version cause boost track potential atlus leave credit tribe difficult sound experience father fantasy explosion insatiable nocturne forget two reap gameplay seal system call borrowing note loose mixed away hard much rock character create storyline)that soundtrack immersed graphic duke could come character take open everyone effect storyline compose arise one junkyard depth new whole help pivitol shin strange become promise let's help time unmistakable gaming game also helpless similarity voice fashion virus play yet story old though take appease similarity togother allow saga piece begin rather slight transform second vocal exp/ap extremely order hour boss true slave average half optional write think war enough fashion employes take slightly form smt must spin-off middle interesting music apopcalyptic little tribes thing set especaly series lot deal place kick temple addictive similar act canibalism gamer good use add bizzare hunger check bos close satisfied end discover fast keep promising smt:dds make nirvana victorious capture look wonderful slicing mechanism well ultra say another final plethoria saga's want inovative sequil way manner feature conquor add moment pace merges soft ruling towards great already feel begin tensei fact play devil utilizes immensly mantra twice esper engine probably imeediatily digital award skill learn karma triumph drawn intertwine techno supposidly shape even battle lead deliver rpg short encounter puzzle include end make dramatic cover

An added bonus is ""The Art of Kinetica,"" a small booklet presenting close-up images of the game's characters. Perhaps most impressive is the incredibly FAST load time for each race venue.  The expansive worlds and their glorious detail take almost no time at all to load; this is made to seem even shorter as the game screen offers a tip to improve a palyer's performance while the venue loads.  Another wonderful aspect is that the fast-paced gameplay is NOT interrupted by dropped frames :-) The only potential drawback is the lack of a specific stunt track and/or interactive stunt tutorial (such as is available in SSX).

1346,300606,3,False,"03 13, 2014",A3K6JC2AHJXKFF,B00CH9253W,Hydrolord,"I was a huge Mario Party fan growing up, and I started a couple of Mario Party Facebook pages. I remember being so pumped for Mario Party 6 after playing the demo at Target, and then watching the MP7 trailer over and over a year later. I had some minor quibbles with Mario Party 8, but I ended up enjoying it just as much as the others. Then we got Mario Party DS, which was decent. And then the years dragged by without a new game. Hudson Soft broke up and Nd Cube was formed from its ashes. And clearly Nd Cube just couldn't swallow their pride and stick to the formula. They had to jack up the Mario Party franchise beyond repair.  Okay, to be fair, this game isn't THAT bad. I had some fun with it. One thing that made it a step up from MP9 is the variety in the stages. There's one stage that uses the Mini Stars, one that's very similar to Wii Party's Board Game Island, one where you want to be the LAST one to the finish to avoid Bowser, etc. There's also one board I have yet to try because you need two other human players. And I think you'll have a hard time convincing your friends to play Island Tour when you could play one of the console ones (or even Mario Party DS). But some of the other stages are fun. The other huge plus is that they ditched the car and let you move on your own again. Thank goodness.  On the other hand, the Minigame Mode is a huge step down. While the Party Mode in MP9 was kind of a bust, at least I knew that there were still some fun minigame modes. Island Tour basically gives you Free Play and the mode where you try to be the first to win a set number of minigames. That's it. Also, I may be imagining it, but it seems like a lot of the minigames are more simplistic than they've been in the past. There's nothing wrong with a few simpler minigames, but it gets annoying when the rules to every new minigame you play can be summed up in one very short sentence. Tap Dash is the best example of this. I said in my review of Mario Party 9 that Skyjinks was the worst minigame ever, but Tap Dash has claimed that thrown. Characters appear on the top screen, and you touch their picture on the touch screen before anyone else can. It's just such a pointless game.  So, at the end of the day, when you weigh the pros and cons, this game really isn't better than Mario Party 9. I'll just have to sit and hope that they'll return to form for Mario Party 10.

For a time there, it was incompatible, but for those of you looking to blow the dust off those old discs, I have good news:  it works in Windows 7.  No Compatibility Mode tweaking or other fiddling necessary:  I just stuck in the disc, ran the installer, and was good to go.  You won't find a stunning max resolution, but you can force newer tweaks through the nVidia Control Panel using the ""Application-specific"" settings.  To that end, I've gone back down the rabbit-hole, and now I'm going to take you along with me.  American McGee's ""Alice"" was designed to tell a newer story from Lewis Carroll's classic:  Alice's family perished in a terrible fire.  Alice has gone mad with grief and survivor's guilt.  You are Alice, returned to a weeping Wonderland that begs for her to set it right.  This third-person shooter uses a variety of clever weapons, from croquet mallets that bludgeon one way, alt-fire an electrified croquet ball another...to the very magical Blunderbuss if you can find it in its secret location.  The many creatures that menace Alice are a combination of folklore (fiery imps, a witch who would eagerly eat you) to book-lore (the Jabberwock, the Mad Hatter), and unique creations in between (creepy dollface spiders, a centipede with a German soldier's helmet and flaming eyes).  The environments are interesting, and the voicework is for the most part ahead of its time (which puts it close to the professional-polish we get in newer games today).  There are some problems you would expect from an older game, such as a difficult jumping mechanic and occasional button-lag, but otherwise the slow climb through the many interesting levels make it all worth the effort.

I was never interested in the first Infamous, but I couldn't resist grabbing it when it hit $20 without being relegated to crummy Greatest Hits packaging; it had only been out for a few months. I liked it more than I expected I would... enough that I played through it twice, just to see the full range of both karma move sets. I was mildly excited when Infamous 2 came out, but I didn't like it as much as the original. It was basically more of the same in what I personally thought was a less appealing setting. Emprire City from the first game might have been a generic metropolis, but I guess I prefer that to a run down s*** hole armpit of a town like New Marais. Flood Town... difficult for me to believe anyone actually enjoyed running around in that dump. I appreciate the political commentary on Katrina, that doesn't mean I want to play a video game set there. Like many other Infamous fans, I didn't approve of the new and improved Cole redesign, turning him from a skinhead bad ass into a metrosexual pretty boy. Sucker Punch immediately pussed out and cowtowed to us whiners, ran back to the drawing board and whipped up a new ""original formula"" Cole instead. He looked so lame that I wondered if there was some spite behind it. He ended up looking like some kind of not-yet-fully-formed man-sized foetus. It was a perfect lesson in ""be careful what you ask for,"" I really wish SP had stuck to their guns. I thought Infamous 2 was the definition of a tepid, phoned-in sequel. I finished it once with good karma, but I could only stomach about half of a second play through. It wasn't terrible, though... I can't say I regret playing through it the one time. Really weirds me out that its the fan favorite.  So when Infamous SS was announced back in Feb 2013, I shrugged. It was clearly going to be a nice bit of PS4 eye candy, and I suppose I assumed I'd buy it at some point if only for that. Well, about a week before it came out, I read somewhere that Jamie Griesemer was the lead game play designer. *THAT* got my attention. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a diehard Halo fan, specifically for the single player campaigns. And that's where Jamie made a name for himself as a game play designer. Suddenly SS had become a ""must play on day 1"" title for me. I spent the entire last weekend playing it and am now almost finished with my second play through. All I can say is that this is by far my favorite Infamous game. The game play is indeed great. It very much keeps to the spirit of the first two, but it's considerably expanded and much more polished. Easily the best city so far, both in terms of looks and being fun to explore and run around in. I don't really detect any of Griesemer's fingerprints specifically... it's just good fun to play. Some of the traditional franchise elements have been discarded, like ""riding"" along rails and lines throughout the city, but they've been traded in for major upgrades- e.g. light speed running up walls and across rooftops, or literally flying up and over buildings. Combat has been seriously tuned and tightened up compared to previous games. The graphics are at least as good as expected, if not better. The characters are likable, unless they're not supposed to be. Troy Baker's been getting on my nerves lately simply due to his sheer ubiquitousness... but I didn't mind him one bit in this game.  The only downsides I can think of are that the game is relatively short compared to the first two. It took me at least two or three full days worth of playing to finish them, but SS took me just over one day. And it does fall into a rut similar to games like Assassins Creed 1, where you get to do the same small handful of mini-missions over and over and over as you clear out the separate sections of the city one by one. Repetitive or not, they're still fun for the most part... so I don't see this as a major gripe.  Truly great game, nice to finally have another PS4 showcase to go along with Killzone Shadow Fall.

I love the Mad Max movies, and I really wanted to love this game! it's just like a post apocalyptic version of Shadow of Mordor(Another game I didn't like, for the same reasons)...I just don't! However, this is just my personal taste..there's plenty to love, which I will talk about first, followed by why the game just didn't make my grade.  The combat is awesome! It's very fluid and has a similar feel to the combat from Arkham games as well as Shadow of Mordor.  HUGE open world! You can go anywhere and explore from day one!  Customization to your car! Add on stickers, paints, hood ornaments.....whatever! You can also purchase upgrades to your car to make it handle better or just withstand more of what the wastelands throw at you!

But if I were to criticize its challenge level, I would say it's not hard enough. There are a few quirks; if you want some of the extras, you have to walk on every step of certain dungeons. But since you can get out of random battles by talking to monsters, this is much less frustrating than in could be. This game also shows some of Japan's less savory aspects; one of the adult female characters is slightly obsessed with getting a boyfriend. But since she's a strong, foul-mouthed kickboxer, this isn't quite as irritating as it could be. And the characters are generally likeable, interesting, and believable -- and you'll learn something about modern Japan from their interactions. Plus, you can shape their growth by equipping them with a Persona that will increase a certain stat that they need help with, or that is their most important aspect. The voice acting is very good, the graphics are nice, the monster designs are delightfully kooky, and the anime sequences are great. This is a game for teenagers and adults; not because it's especially violent or sexual, but because it's mature. It takes patience to unlock all the extras and grow your Personas, which allow you to use magic and do necessary combos with others. It also takes judgement to decide which Personas to use.

I was on the fence about VR from the beginning, but the more I saw of the games for PSVR got me interested enough to take the plunge and buy this without even playing it somewhere else first. I'm so glad I did.  You really can't describe VR accurately to someone unless they've experienced it. You really feel like you're in a completely different place. The sense of depth is incredible, and I found myself reaching up to grab objects in front of me because it felt like I could. It's a really neat sensation that you have to experience for yourself before you can understand it fully.  The graphics aren't as good as you see just playing a normal PS4 game on your HDTV, but the effect of being in the space of the game is so incredible that I really stopped noticing ""graphics"" and was focused on being there and playing whatever the game was. That said, I am getting the PS4 Pro next month which is supposed to improve the frame rates and graphical fidelity, because honestly anything you can do to enhance the experience is worth it in my opinion.  The headset itself was really easy to setup. Yes, there are a lot of cables, but I had it hooked up in less than 5 minutes, calibrated and ready to play in less than 10 total. The headset feels really nice and high quality. Very comfortable. It took me a couple of minutes to really get it fitted to my head where it felt perfect.  I haven't had a chance to play anything with the Move controllers yet, so I won't talk about those. The new camera is really nice and way smaller than I expected.  VR Worlds is really neat so far and I think probably the best way to introduce VR to the user. The Scavenger game made me just to TINY bit motion sick when I started moving around a lot. Not bad though. I think it will be a good idea for me personally to take dramamine if I know I'll be playing something where I'll be moving a lot. Still, really really cool stuff and I can't wait to play more.  All that said, I don't believe this is the future of gaming. I know there are people out there who think VR gaming will take over and no one will be playing just sitting on the couch and looking at their TV. VR is really cool, and perfect for certain types of games, but it's really only comfortable to play for shorter periods of time and I believe it will be used as a supplemental gaming device for parties when you have friends and family over, and for very specific games that are just better in VR.  Is it worth $500 (or $400), I would say absolutely. Don't take the footage you see on the internet of VR games and judge the games on that. You really have to experience them to understand what they're all about.

Usually (given the nature of muscle memory and all), any new mouse will seem strange at first, but this mouse immediately felt like slipping on a perfectly-sized glove. The comfort level of this mouse is through the roof. It is similar ergonomically to the deathadder. If you have smaller hands and consider the deathadder a bit awkwardly large, I would go for the identical (except for size) EC2-A, which I would consider the more ""medium"" sized variant.  I hated the nasty, slippery, wear-prone rubber grips on the side of my deathadder. The EC series, which lacks such grips, feels so much smoother, cleaner, and cooler to the touch. The clickers are also a bit more poignant in that they're louder and register a more solid feeling of the click going through, whilst not being overly stiff. Simply put, the clicking is consistent and satisfying. Someone mentioned the side buttons having a slight amount of play in them (unlike the main clickers) prior to registration of the click. While this is true, I found it to not be a problem in the slightest. You'll always click them if you're wanting to and never when you're not. They feel perfectly fine to me.  The ""skates"" on the bottom are very effective. Unlike the deathadder which has two tiny feet at the front of the mouse, the EC-2 has a very large pad there, and another large one (larger than the deathadder's) in the rear. It glides extremely smoothly. My previous mouse felt a little ""scrapey"", while this mouse feels like it's moving on melted butter (I use a hard-style mousepad).  This mouse requires no drivers, so you can take it anywhere and not have to worry about installing any bloatware. Though I personally think Synapse is pretty cool, I do not miss it. If you want macros and such, you can always use a third party application. This mouse is no-frills, instead focusing on comfort, performance, ergonomics, and accuracy.  I'm not an expert on mouse sensors and I don't play many shooters (more RTS, RPG and the like), but it seems extremely consistent, fluid, and accurate to me.  DPI is changed by a button on the bottom of the mouse, and each DPI setting illuminates the scroll wheel with its own signature color. Although you can't choose what color you want in its own right (the colors are hardcoded and merely intended as DPI indicators), the LED, no matter the color you end up with, is crisp and brilliant, and really makes the mouse look cool. If color is that important to you, you can choose the one you like then finetune higher or lower in the Windows mouse sensitivity screen, or adjust in-game sensitivity.  The scroll wheel itself feels very similar to my deathadder. I hear the former version of this mouse had scroll wheel issues, but this one is a pleasure to use.

1369,196010,4,False,"03 28, 2012",A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B002BSA1C6,Richard Baker,"The Good: Lots of new features, hundreds of cars to choose from, first ever online mode, new clean and streamlined menus, seasonal and special events are a blast, excellent visuals, cockpit views with true 1080p support  The Bad: Only premium cars look good, some tracks look very outdated, you really need to focus and drive perfectly to win, tuning cars can be very difficult to troubleshoot, frequent and long load times, various issues that make playing the game difficult  Ever since GT4 the series has had a lot of problems with visuals, content, and just overall polish. GT4 was infamous for its high difficulty and questionable car selection. However, the series is known as the best looking racing simulator, and the one with the most realistic driving physics. GT5 has all of that, but problems lie in other areas, but more on those later.  The first things you will notice is the new menu which is laid out better instead of pins on a map. You will notice a used car menu (which tracks mileage now), a better maintenance shop, the ability to generate a unique user profile for online races, and now seasonal events. Seasonal events are updated quarterly and feature endless amounts of races so when you finish the disc content you don't get bored. Even tuning your vehicle is more user-friendly thanks to better descriptions and better visual guides. Polyphony really polished up the menus so everything looks more streamlined and not so cluttered and confusing. You know right where something is and how to get to it without referring to guides or searching around.  Buying cars is really fun thanks to the huge selection and in-depth descriptions and history of each car. There are hundreds of them so car aficionados won't get bored or yawn at the selection. A few new car dealers are Maserati and Lamborghini to name a couple. There are a lot of selections that can cost millions, so you should stick to the used dealerships until your credits are in the millions. The car selection is varied and strong so I have no complaints here.  When you actually race the physics are excellent, and the new cockpit view is amazing. However, only premium vehicles have high-resolution textures and a cockpit view. The rest of the cars look like complete crap and have no cockpit view. Why do this? I have no idea, but it looks tacky and unfinished and is a real blow to the game. The cars that do look good look photo realistic and the cockpit views are just amazing. Needles move on the dash, and even the rear window and seats are shown in the car. Driving the cars has a great feeling, but of course you will have to fine tune them to get some to drive properly. If you aren't a racing simulator fan you are going to hate this because it can take hours to get a single car to drive just right. Tuning the cars is very easy to do thanks to the clean menus, but if you add too much power to most cars they won't drive right anymore.  Slip streaming has been added to the game, and driving properly such as gas goosing, late braking, and everything else has never been more important thanks to the updated physics. Most of the races are just challenging enough that if you focus and drive right you will win. I rarely had races where I was blown off by the competition, but being able to see the PP (Performance Points) that the other cars have helps a lot too. If you feel you need to tune something on the fly you can now do so in the race menu instead of having to completely quit the race. If you race it for long enough you will need to do engine overhauls and chassis alignments now thanks to the new physics system.  While shopping for cars and racing them is fun, the first ever online mode, photo mode, and new community features are a plus as well. Museum cards can be acquired by logging in every day, new paint jobs can be acquired by winning vehicles, and there are just so many little things added that it all adds up to make a big difference in the overall experience. Winning licenses, however, is just as big of a pain as ever before, but the new special events are a nice touch such as NASCAR racing, go carts, and even Top Gear Rally events. Polyphony really tried adding variety to the game and it shows indefinitely.  There are a lot of little problems with the game that add up to really frustrate you. For example when I select a race that has requirements why can't it take me to the dealerships to buy that car if its country specific or a specific drive train. Why do I have to memorize the flag symbol in order to know which dealership belongs to which country? I've already mentioned the cockpit and low resolution standard cars issue. Why are there still loading times between every menu and how come they can be so long? Some tracks look really ugly and weren't updated at all with cardboard cutout buildings and flat grass textures. Why are the graphics all over the place? There are so many questions as to why these issues are present, but I guess we will never know.  With some other nice features like custom soundtracks, a huge selection of supported wheels, true 1080p visuals, 3D and Eye support. GT5 has so many options, features, and a huge car selection that will make any car fan drool.

I had to play for two days to finish the game so she could find out who the killer was and who lives and who dies. It was exhausting. The stress of playing and trying to survive through the numerous action sequences was almost too much for me.  After it was all done, we still talked about the game/story.

1383,162049,3,False,"07 20, 2015",A1E8EXMWOA7RT7,B00178631E,Piaw Na,"I will admit that I'm one of those people who always power down his desktop whenever he's not using it. The reason is that my desktop is power hungry (idles around 150W). But with Google Photos recently providing unlimited storage, I decided to just keep the desktop on and upload all 66,000 photos (including many in RAW format) into the cloud. Since the PC was already on all the time (the process is taking weeks!), this reduced the mental barrier against playing games on the PC, and hence I ended up playing PC games that I never got around to doing so. This is an entirely irrational decision, because the difference between running the 7870 GPU idle and loaded is more than the cost of powering up and running the PS4 (which has essentially the same GPU!).  I'd picked up the Max Payne 3 and GTA IV package for $3 a year or so back. GTA IV was completely unplayable, especially after the delectable Sleeping Dogs: the characters were detestable, the controls were sloppy, and the driving unbearable. Max Payne 3, however, is essentially a cover shooter (or at least, on Easy you can play it like a cover shooter), which is one of my favorite genres, so I played it through to see what the incredibly high reviews were about.  The game is long, but a lot of it is because of incredibly long cut scenes. From reading the forums online, apparently these cut scenes were a result of the previous generation consoles taking so long to load assets from disk that they had to put in movies so you weren't staring at a loading screen for a long time.  The shooting part of the game is just fine. Apparently though I was playing it wrong: you're supposed to treat it like a running shooter rather than a cover shooter, but whatever. The flaws in the game, however, turn it into a frequently frustrating experience. Unlike Uncharted 2, the game wrests control from the player all the time, leaving one with a feeling of a complete lack of agency. This is compounded by the game's collectible system: frequently, what you're supposed to do after a fight is to run around the room picking up ammo and collectibles. But if you were to stumble into an exit zone (which aren't clearly marked), then suddenly the game takes over and you're driven into a cut scene where you're not allowed to retreat and explore. This is annoying as heck if you ran down your ammo shooting the previous room and then are moving into the next room with a huge disadvantage. Even worse, it means you're pretty much guaranteed to miss clues that advance the story.  Fortunately, on easy mode, if you die enough times, the game gives you more and more health packs and ammo until you can finish the scene.  The story has excellent production values, with excellent voice acting, but the plot is ridiculously predictable. You could tell who the bad guy is within the first hour, and everything else is just an excuse to gun down lots of other people. There are no puzzles, and the pacing is extremely uneven, with some shooting scenes ending and transitioning almost immediately into another shooting scene, while you sometimes go through long cut scenes only to endure a pointless wandering around before stumbling onto another fire fight.  The game's technical implementation is nice: you can play either with a controller or with keyboard and mouse, with the mouse giving you far more control and faster action at the expense of it being in a pain to enter bullet time. But you don't have to choose your control scheme: you can switch between one or the other at will, and the game picks it up and moves pretty nicely despite all that. I ran Max Payne 3 at my monitor's native resolution of 2560x1440, and the GPU wasn't maxed out the entire time, though (as expected from an extra 200W of power draw) the room did get warm.  What's interesting is how little the CPU of my 6 year old Core i7 920 was taxed: despite the uploading to Google Photos in the background, I never noticed any jitter and slow down due to the number of background processes running (including the web-browser). In daily use, I notice the web browser slowing down as I can frequently out-type the blogger text-edit field!

I'm 25 years old and I work long hours behind a computer, I come home and I want something to relax to that's not going to require large amounts of my time. The DreamCast fit the bill, with a great price and game library right out of the local arcade. Why buy a DreamCast so late in the game? Because although it's over a year old, if you judge a game console based on both  it's technology and it's game library, the DreamCast is the best console on the market. The price point is also outstanding, especially since you get a 56k modem and an Internet web browser with the system (there are many games that are on-line ready as well). You are not tied to a Sega ISP either, that makes this the most inexpensive sit-top Internet appliance on the market. When it comes to games, I like arcade games. If you like arcade style games, Sega makes some of the best and here you have perfect (I mean perfect) arcade games. You can also buy many of the first generation games for $20 or less. The PlayStation 2 is another machine to consider, IMHO the PS2's current crop of games do not justify it's heavy price tag, also if you have a DVD player on your TV, you are wasting money buying the PS2's DVD player (since the DVD has proven to be a failure for software delivery). The DreamCast has a very powerful graphics processor, it's inexpensive and it's quality control department works overtime to make sure only quality games are released. The PS2 will eventually beat it out, there are games like ""Metal Gear Solid 2"", but that's not relivant when you consider that PlayStation will always be at a disadvantage when it comes to great arcade style games. Sure they have Namco and Williams, but so does Sega (see dremacaast versions of Soul Calibur and Ready 2 Rumble), and Sega has their own brand that makes some really incredible games that are unbeatable in fun, but untill PS2 catches up DreamCast should be your #1 pick.

I can see how some people would complain that this game is too hard, and others that it is too easy, but to me they got the difficulty just right.  At first, certain parts of World 1 were kicking my butt.  But before too long I got the hang of it, and I have had a whole lot of fun with it.  Some stages can still seem difficult, but not too difficult.  And at first, it seemed impossible to find secret exits.  That's a good thing.  I do wish that finding all the star coins was a bit more challenging though, it may only take you one heavy day of playing.  I think this actually has less classic mario enemies than Super Princess Peach has.  Guess that was because they were trying to keep this game fairly simple.  The one part of this game that I think they could have done better is the music - none of the tunes really seem catchy to me.  But the enemies and Fire Flowers sure seem to think the tunes are catchy - sometimes I let enemies live just so I can watch them dance to the music.

1405,328515,5,True,"10 30, 2013",ABQWMANK4AR63,B00FATRKLI,JDThird,"I have four Xbox 360's in my house since I use them as extenders for my Windows Media Center PC that runs my TV.  But one of them was the original Xbox 360 from the initial release when they first started being sold.  It still worked (no red ring of death) but was noisy as all you know what and didn't have a large hard drive.  I've got the Xbox One preordered already, but since games aren't backwards compatible I knew I have to keep a 360 system on my main TV in the great room anyway.  So I thought I'd take advantage of decent pricing and get a new one that will sit next to the XB1 when it arrives, that will be in warranty for a little while as well.  And this way I can move the slim into my Halo Vanguard portable gaming system, pull the elite out of there to put back into my room, and shuffle things about.  And all this will free up an Xbox I can give away to someone.  The unit itself is nice.  People are complaining about the lack of an optical audio out, so if you need that, the 360E is not for you.  I use HDMI so not an issue for me at all.  The controller is standard, as is the Kinect (although there's a bit more to the logo than my existing Kinect). The power brick is similar to the one for the Xbox 360 slim, but rather than two power barrels on the end, there's just one barrel with multiple sections on the cylinder.  There's a network port still which I like, since I don't like saturating my wireless with things that I can run plugged into my gigabit network here at home.  The unit is nice.  I like that it's more a match to the forthcoming Xbox One, and I like the less intrusive appearance from the front, since the power button and lights are a fraction of the size of previous version's power buttons.  This comes at a cost, however.  There is no longer any indication of what controllers are connected, like you used to be able to see with the four different quarter arc lights around the power button indicating player 1, player 2, etc.  There is no more indication of any controller connected whatsoever.  This is a bit of a deprecation, but since it's generally me and my 10 year old son playing, it's not something that impacts us.  The buttons are buttons again, not just sensors like the Xbox Slim had.  Physical clicking buttons for power and eject.  Fit and finish is nice.  But the big thing is the silence.  And it is VERY silent.  I'm about 15 feet away on the couch and can't hear anything at all from it.  Even up close, it's dead silent.  The drive also makes considerably less noise when reading discs than the slim or previous versions did.  It took me several hours to transfer content from the slim to this via a USB stick, and then the hassle for transferring licenses and redownloading things that I couldn't just transfer over in that process.  UI is smooth, I didn't see any difference here between this and any of the previous Xbox versions I have.  The games are alright, but don't buy it for the games since they're usually discounted separately now anyway.  And be aware, the racing game is a code only, you have to download all 6.8 GB before you can play it.  If you're looking for an Xbox 360 because you want to be able to play the games available, this is a great choice.  If you are looking to replace an existing older Xbox 360 for whatever reason like I was, it's a great choice.  If you're looking for any new features, there are none.  Some people prefer the looks of the Xbox 360 slim, so you can always get that without any loss of functionality compared to this one.  They're ALL going to be cheaper because of the push to get as many sold as they can before the Xbox One launches in another 22 days.  For the price, I thought it was a great deal, getting the games, the new style Xbox 360, and another kinect that my son can take with the Vanguard when he goes gaming elsewhere.",Still great even with the XB1 on the horizon,1383091200,15.0,,,player alright compatible shuffle indicate power go i've arrives barrel room get many thing different impact deprecation launch original logo usb audio pull barrel home version bite separately extenders hear port controller sensor tv release hdmi fraction kinect main process stick two without system noise halo year they're backwards complain portable know give away house hard move drive think cylinder none button xbox like sell saturating start four usually connect cost optical can't several network button size appearance ring finish loss one click death new whatever silent vanguard plug exist day first eject game buy redownloading etc also game decent match still anyway see gigabit physical racing license choice play discount style since old run son warranty center there's always elsewhere rather code nice preordered use longer red however hour download prefer generally need next unit i'd pc take noisy big run initial considerably although less little thing dead indication push back deal similar foot able free take used pricing fit come game get standard wireless close front aware sit i'm previous whatsoever quarter know well another difference look arc look via read couch way smooth someone controller something great brick multiple already put play ui replace medium issue windows intrusive functionality compare forthcoming reason go work large cheap transfer lack price light want disc gb even advantage transfer hassle elite around version's section content end make slim people available get anything old keep silence feature

I would say that I would love to pick this game if I wanted something to destress my day after work or after playing a hardcore game for 8 hours. This is your simple mindless shooting game where you can run around and shoot your enemies. The cuts scenes are nice but I play at night and hardly have the volume up since others are sleeping. So far I haven't found anything that the cut scene has that was crucial so your basic ""find enemy and shoot"" is your goal.

Even though you'll often go gun crazy in this game you won't feel as if you're rambo because there are always team members folowing or leading. The bad part is that sometimes it is very hard to know who the enemy is if you plan on taking an alternate path.  The battles: They are very gripping and fun to play through. Levels are mostly lineer with nav points on the radar prompting you where to go. Nothing too complicated. The melee punches are fun to use but the grenade seems to be rather useless at times. Can't shoot and throw a granade at the same time. Players stand there winding up a granade and hope that the soldier's A.I. isn't smart enough to see you. Often times I would empty several more rounds into an enemy that is already dead but I could not tell because his death animation ended above the ground making him look as if he was standing.

This game utilizes the Wii Remote to `swing', and the Nunchuck to position your player, aim the ball, and get ready to serve.  I found the game was more fun after going through the 2 pages of tutorials.  This is not necessarily a game that you can play right out of the box, unlike Wii Sports.  Unlike other games before it, it utilizes different physics from one court to the next and the players have different strengths.  Not one player is maxed out in statistics, like in games like Tiger Woods (although, in his case, it probably is more like reality but back to Tennis).  Graphics is mediocre but there is no screen flicker or slowdown.  There are replays and `screen action modes' to get a zoomed up view of your player; however, it does get old so clicking `B' gets you right back into the action.  You can also perform gestures to show your happiness or frustration with your player.  Music is actually good, and not repetitive.  Setup of your Wii remote involves holding it on its side, which is unconventional from the standard way to hold the remote, so it is awkward to start.  You can opt for Normal Serve or Easy Serve/Special shot with the Nunchuck.  What makes this game more realistic is the ability to aim your shot, make your player run to the baseline or net, hit Top Spins or Slice Shots.  You can also perform Drop shots and lob shots.  I find Singles play to be easy for me.  Conceptually, I cannot get into the rhythm of Doubles play, so I will pass.  Menu navigation is easy.  There are three modes: Party, Exhibition and Road to Glory. Road to Glory involves progressing in your seeding through various events.  Party involves winning by capitalizing on various aspects of a match.

1430,38131,5,False,"11 16, 2004",AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00006I02Z,OverTheMoon,"There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine, so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do at the time. (1)Story, (2)Story, (3)Story. Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO researchers and the X-Files was beginning to become mainstream viewing. Alien based entertainment media was then a craze in the mid and late 1990's that was unprecedented since the 1950s. Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came HALF-LIFE where YOU get to play as Gordon Freeman, a physics researchers who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility. All hell breaks loose and YOU have to survive. No cut scenes. No initial story. No explanation. You where just there and you had to escape. Cue interactive characters that could follow you around, say a few things and shoot monsters - maps rich in objects that you could break.  The GOOD NEWS is that Half-Life 2 is another world beyond HL1 and is like nothing you have ever played before! This IS the first person shooter 'Game of games', hands down, period. As a stand alone game, HL2 is 100% pure adrenaline, no holds bard, from start to finish. If you own a PC then own HL2 because the world will never be the same again. Half-Life 2 WILL destroy lives, educations and marriages and...  ...IT IS NOT A GAME!  ... or at least that is the net result. This thing was real. Forget Doom 3, FarCry or any of the best pixel pushers out there - HL2 just mashes `em into the ground and then sets off an amazing fireworks display to welcome you back. How many games within the first two levels have you literally calling friends, family and neighbours to have a look at it? You must LIVE this game.  Okay so at 9:02 I unlocked HL2 and got playing. I have simply not stopped except to write this. Maybe Farcry has the edge on jungle texture, but nowhere else will you see anything as amazing as City 17. The game starts right where the previous one left off, as you are dumped into this futuristic eastern European city like something out of 1984 following a brief meeting with the GMAN. 100% Orwell. Basically you learn that citizens are slowly going missing from City 17 and you must meet up with old friends (scientists from the first game including security guard Barney) and as soon as your teleporter goes wonky you are landed right in on the action as soldiers storm apartments looking for you. On the run you manage to land a hovercraft and go on to tear through flood channels ramping over things and seeing full scale battlecraft fly overhead... and when you hit them, bits break off and explode... slowly... so you give `em more heat... and more bits break off... and then they crash and burn with a roaaaaarrr! The gem of the game though is when you play with DOG (wait till you see this thing) and learn a neat trick with a new weapon called the Gravity gun. Now this thing is unreal because you can lift anything and send it flying in the direction of some bad guy. Not to spoil to fun but let a few disc saws whirl and watch what happens to the bad guys or even throw a petrol canister into a group of zombies and hear them scream. The animation is hyper-realistic and your fps will match your heartbeat. This is THE REAL DEAL.  The characters all have their own unique personality and walk, talk and act differently. The cut scenes all look great and are done in 1st person as you walk around the event. Like its predecessor, each level is designed with plenty of tasks to do, puzzles to solve and bad guys to mow down. There is also team play in this one like in HL1 but is more organized with much more firepower. Anyway I will not spoil the story for you (basically join the resistance in City 17 and win the war) but like I said if you have a thing for 1984, conspiracy theory or the New World Order, then HL2 has it all! HL2 also borrows HUGELY from other games and films you have seen, but that just makes it all the better because it seems somewhat familiar, yet ABSOLUTELY NEW.  The bottom line is that is, hands down, the best 1st person shooter probably for the next 4 years or so. I seriously doubt anything, ANYTHING, in the next 24 months is going to be patch on this experience.  Pros:  - It does not feel like a game. It feels real. - Totally immersion in a film-like environment. - Truly massive maps with PLENTY to do. - Action, action, action, non-stop. - Lots and lots of variation in the gameplay. - GRAVITY GUN! - A real interesting futuristic story - The best 1st person shooter (maybe game) ever. - Counter-Strike: Source comes with it.  Cons: (Benchmark on a 3ghz P4, 1GB RAM, RADEON 9800Pro 256mb) - Sometimes you will wait more than 60 seconds between load times. - Most load times are greater than 15 seconds. - Even a high-end machine gets challenged by this game. - Valve and Vivendi really botched the marketing but that aside HL2 is EVERYTHING YOU COULD EXPECT AND A LOT LOT MORE.

However, while MOH:Frontline and Blood Omen (I & II) all offered good storylines, Bloodrayne is ridiculously lacking in that capacity: Agent Bloodrayne must go after  her vampire rapist father who is in league with Nazis in 1938 after having watched her mentor get eaten by a huge parasite that was created by a nazi in cahoots with a Cajun Witch in Louisiana (psssssssss.......I think they stole this plot from a Stephen Seagal flick). The graphics varie greatly from part to part.  Bloodrayne herself is rendered beautifully, but many of the enemies look like they stepped out of a fps from ps1.  Also the difficulty varies alot from place to place which can be annoying, the first boss is pretty difficult, but then you get a bunch of cake opponents to fight for a pretty long time.  I was also dissapointed that the gameplay does not really involve stealth at all seeing as how your supposed to be an AGENT INFILTRATING Nazi Compounds and such.

This expansion has gone way beyond my expectations. I began playing FFXIV: A Realm Reborn a little over a year ago, and although I liked the gameplay, I found the story lackluster particularly compared to the last MMO I played (FFXI) which had a rich complex story. Heavensward is a huge step up in quality of story, music, graphics, and content. This is a must buy for anyone who has the game.  Content: Heavensward adds a TON of content to the game. 3 new jobs (Dark Knight, Astrologian, Machinist), 8 new dungeons, 4 primal fights (Ravana story/Ex, and Bismark story/Ex), a new raid (Alexander), flying mounts (Flying Fat Chocobo FTW!), new minions, several new areas, a lot of quests,etc. Level cap increases to 60 for all jobs. Free Company airships can now be crafted. Every job now has new skills. I can go on and on and on. Basically every part of the game has added content.  Story: I thought most of the 2.0 (A Realm Reborn) story to be lackluster outside of Binding Coil of Bahamut. The end of the 2.0 story leading up to Heavensward was amazing. I was shocked that the story got so good so fast. This continues in 3.0 (heavenesward) and the story stays consistently good. I am only lvl 56 at the moment but I have really enjoyed every moment of the story thus far.  Graphics: There is now support for DX11, big upgrade over DX9. The level of detail in every new zone is amazing. The ability to fly allows you to see the areas in a whole different light. In the old areas many objects and details in the background were meant to be viewed from far off and did not have quite as much detail. In Heavensward areas you may see a small floating island, but since you can actually fly to it the developers made them all much more detailed. Each new area is much much bigger than the 2.0 areas, not just in distance from one end to the other but vertically as well with flying mounts. Each map is about 4-5x the size of the old ones.  Music: The music in the new areas is a very underrated aspect of the game. There are much more piano themes.

And if nothing else, it is one of the few first player shooters (including System Shock and Half-life) that I have not been able to stop playing since I got it?  So how was UT able to beat out the QUAKE III team (the pioneers  of the DM shooter)?  Let's compare! First off, the graphics are  beautiful, and just the fact that the color scheme is more than just  buffalo chip brown makes a big difference.  All of the light variants, wall  textures, skins, explosions, and background textures make the revamed  Unreal engine look like gods paintbrush.  In my opinion, the quake engine  is dying, no matter how much they revamp it, and in this case, way too goth  and way too dark to see any of the other players. Although each of the  games maps have some problems, UT is the clear winner here, with over 50  maps that each have their own special touches and singular beauty (although  some may look better than play better).  Quake's maps are very linear and  flat and don't have the same kind of spark that the UT maps have. As for  AI, Quake got it all wrong here.  UT's AI is a beautiful sight, with enough  tweaks on the main menu for you to match the exact difficulty with your  skill level.  Quake...not exactly.  And furthermore, UT has an automatic  skill changer, which allows the computer to adapt to your skill level.  Awesome.  oh and...I couldn't care less about the lack of varity in the UT  skins, they still look awesome. In addition, the AI of UT and Quake III  are what really make the First player mode a treat in UT and a painful  experince Quake III.  First of all, the first player mode in Quake isn't  worth my fingernail clipings.  It is terribly lame and also the bots AI's  are very sketchy and need a lot of teaking.  In UT, first player is great  for both newcomers for practice, and for pros who want to practice offline  before they slug it out online.  These guys act almost if not exaclty like  human players!  I love it! Variety is no contest.  UT has not only  deathmatch, but assault, CTF, Domination, Last man standing, and a whole  slew of new weapons.  Quake has deathmatch and relativly old and barely  revamped weapons. In addition, interface, multiplayer, hardware reqs and  overall replay value all go to UT.  This game looks good with or without a  video card and even on my 330 MHZ PII w/128 SDRAM it looked good (thanks to  my Creative Anihilator Pro video card) Everything about this game has been  made as slick as can be.  Sure, ID may be the deathmatch king, but with  games like Quake III, they better make way for GT and UT! The Good News:  Where quake has failed, GT has triumphed on every level.

You'll be totally lost and confused and won't know who the hell any of the characters are aside from the recognizable Disney ones. Plus, they are all suffering from amnesia and their long, too frequent, cut-scenes have an enigmatic feel to them so you'll still not really ever be sure what is going on no matter how far you get into the game.  I think the card-based strategy of fighting and evolving is a horrible, badly conceived misfire of an idea. This kind of thing may be fine in a Beyblade video-game but in a Disney/Final Fantasy game it's just inappropriate. The whole concept is scatterbrained and random and has no real skill involved. It takes ages to build up a decent combat deck and even when you do the fighting is endless, tedious and boring. You'll fight the same villains in every level and while in appearance the levels may look different (taking their inspiration from many different Disney films) they are essentially all the same.  The fun comes from spotting popular Disney characters and trying to get into the story that involves them. But the plot is so incomprehensible and alienating that I just didn't care after a while.  I did stick with the game for a good few months and found advancing through each level to be an exhilarating and thankless chore. Nothing changed and I never really felt like I was getting anywhere.

1452,116494,2,False,"09 29, 2012",A2171ZGKU3SFDD,B000UW21A0,The Rev,"I can't believe this many people like this game. I really enjoyed this game as an adventure game in the first few levels, but then got steadily more frustrating as the game went on. One of the top reviews mentions that it's an action adventure disguised as a 3rd-person shooter, this is pretty much exactly right. The game starts off as fun as an adventure game, running through a beautiful landscape, coming out to a gorgeous beach scene, only to see an even more epic moment, but as the game progresses on it just turns into a frustrating third-person shooter.  Some of the biggest issues I had with the game, the weak weapons, you feel like you're doing absolutely no damage, the horrible and frustrating cover controls, whenever I tried to quickly switch cover because I was shot or it had been destroyed, in order to quickly get out of cover you have to roll out, well the roll automatically takes you to cover, whether you want to or not or even if it's the right cover, I constantly had frustrating issues w/ this, another frustrating game mechanic annoyance was with the jet ski levels, frustrating to control while having to dodge objects and kill enemies, now for the level design, oh, my, god, I have played many AAA games but yet to find one that has such terrible level design, I kept getting lost in levels in where to go, I understand it's a puzzle game where you have to figure it out, but it's another to make just where you're supposed to go really hard to find. These are all big issues I had w/ this game but nothing compared to my biggest issue w/ this game, so I would just like to put this in a question, and then ask yourself whether you thought this was actually a good game, so how are there people in caves that are only accessible through a puzzle/secret hidden door that hasn't been opened yet? By opening it you say? So if I'm solving the puzzle to gain entrance, that means the door hasn't been opened, so why am I fighting living people (that btw, you are never really sure of who they work for, *story related*) in 1,000 yr plus old unsolved puzzle caves?? I mean, C'MON!!! Now one of the lesser issues I had w/ the game was the story, I guess I can spoil it since the top useful review already did, it starts as a fun treasure hunting story following the heels of Nathan Drake's father, once you get later into the story you meet these monsters, at this point I couldn't help to say, ""really, you had no where to take the story, so you added in monsters? THIS is the twist in the story?! Lame."". People also have mentioned how great the graphics are, yes I realize this was made in 2007, but I've seen 360 games with better graphics, ones w/ no graphical pop-ins and jaggies.  Overall, w/ ALL these problems w/ the game, this game is definitely not deserving of the high score everyone gives it and I do not recommend it, quick overview, story overall was not that great, pretty good story at first but tends to decline and get worse especially toward the end, gameplay mechanics are awful and annoying, the game's worth a rent but not buy, I will be renting UC2 though.  Edit: I also forgot to mention cutscene problems, had this issue a few times, where you would walk into a room and you were supposed to walk up to an object which wasn't always clear which one to go to, so you had to wander around the room just to trigger the cutscene, while the cutscene could have just been triggered more easily by just walking into the room. My last problem w/ this game is more of an annoyance, the ps3 whenever it read my disc it made this loud buzzing sound, so it was a bit of an immersion killer. Another annoying game mechanic I forgot was how you throw grenades, I know Sony wants to take advantage of their 6-axis controller to sell their products, but in order to throw grenades you have to use the motion controls in the controllers to change the distance in the arc of the grenade throw. It could be an interesting feature if in the right game w/ slower enemies, but since it takes you out of cover and they shoot at you while you're adjusting the controller to the exact spot which takes a few seconds, it's an annoyance, it would've been Much better if you could just use the thumbstick to change the arc like in any average cover shooter or at least just let you stay behind cover.",I can't believe this many ppl enjoy this game...,1348876800,4.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,puzzle product horrible i've realize jaggies steadily understand fight start disc figure actually room one walk time last problem get many open object sure late monster oh solve read trigger fun mechanic really third-person annoying progress control right drake's would've point exact let frustrate yes believe slow quickly wander kill bit rent would forget overview controller easily jet sound hidden plus father run constantly enjoy overall mean gameplay stay killer landscape go review know hard score much door think lame like graphic shoot level heel annoyance could turn guess useful question open toward grenade everyone btw can't nothing definitely problem sell well see rent one make lesser added give worth gorgeous first immersion disguise help trigger live top damage issue buy game also suppose weak see meet big game's scene object moment since yet story old try though take spoil behind ask always exactly adjust clear thumbstick spot play use ski gain work mechanic automatically order beach recommend average sony least want bad whenever take change big treasure mean cutscene go interesting decline god distance beautiful enemy adventure good quick mention terrible design puzzle/secret whether game nathan pop-ins get hunt level c'mon keep dodge make cave i'm aaa come destroy motion well say relate another awful arc control entrance find shot feature twist grenade unsolved action deserve controller high tends roll weapon great already feel put issue walk epic compare mention loud lose want yr switch especially accessible even advantage shooter edit second never review graphical around cover mention end people get throw buzz absolutely pretty follow

I was wary of buying it because - not having played the previous games - I figured it would be hours of killing squishy masses while you steamroll all the way to the end credits. I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of the actual game.  Sure, you blow up legions of minor creatures, but that's a sort of mini-game between the actual content. The bosses are tough. The gameplay is a blend of cinematic and action easily on par with Uncharted 2. The gameplay itself is incredibly varied, outright epic in the sheer number of situations tossed at you.  And far from pushing random buttons.. you need to use proper ability combos, though how you decide to tackle a particular situation is up to you. Just as an example, there's a fight somewhat early on where you're up against a Gorgon (Medusa was a Gorgon, to give you an idea of what they look like) while harpies drop bomb-like things on you from the air. You have to jump/dodge to avoid what the harpies are dropping on you, while keeping the Gorgon occupied, as else she'll cast a spell that turns everyone in front of her to stone (and if you don't break out of that fast enough, anything can kill you in one hit). If you kill the harpies first (which requires latching on to them in turn, jumping up and tossing them onto the ground, etc.), a Minotaur spawns. If you kill her, another Minotaur and another set of harpies spawn. It's up to you to decide what order to take all of them out in. But here's an example of how the combat is up to you.. you can keep the Gorgon alive and go stand by the newly spawned Minotaur, wait for her to cast the stone spell, and jump/dive out of the way to turn the *Minotaur* to stone, taking him out in just a few hits (if you kill him the normal way, you get health, so it's up to you - kill him fast by risking getting hit with a powerful spell, or slowly and get some health out of it). The depth of combat is amazing!  There are also standard adventure game style puzzles, much like Uncharted 2 (complete with moving objects around, blowing things up, jumping/climbing/swinging around like a monkey, and some that are very difficult to figure out - I'd recommend spending the 15 mins wondering ""what the hell am I supposed to do here?! is this a bug?"" instead of looking them up online, it's worth it).  There are RPG elements as well. You can upgrade your weapons in any order you want, collect items from somewhat hidden areas (explore, explore, explore!) which will increase your health/item ability (which boosts how long you can shoot your bow before waiting for it to recharge, for example)/mana (spells! you cast spells!), and gather new weapons and abilities as you go.  The graphics are also on par with (or very close to) Uncharted 2. The music, storyline, etc. help create an amazing atmosphere. The environments, like the rest of the game, will dazzle you with their depth and variety. I would suggest spending 5 minutes watching the storyline so far (dozens of videos on YouTube) to really get into it.  It's an amazing game. Having mastered the notoriously-difficult Demons Souls, I'd have to say that playing this on Hard is much more difficult than Demons Souls ever was.

Another review I encountered claimed this was one of those rare instances where the player feels like he is using the entire controller.  How right he was!  You shoot with various guns, melee with an assortment of cool weapons, dodging and flying around like the Demon/Angel hybrid you were literally born to be, a Nephilim with purpose.  Of course, the story does not start out that way, with the main character Dante content to wallow in women and drink, living in a trailer, directionless yet full of untapped potential.  I will not go into the story too deeply, but Dante grows as a character, gathering emotional substance with each new exhilarating experience and touching human connection.  The story is solid.  I was kept interested throughout, even the secondary characters are memorable and fleshed-out, and realistic as they can be in this chaotic world gone mad.  The graphics are good, but it is the level design that had me dropping my jaw and raising my hands to applaud the art direction, not to mention the vibrant blasts of color in every scene.  I was initially interested in this game after playing and thoroughly enjoying another Ninja Theory creation, ""Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"", which definitely has this game beat as far as the story goes, being one of my favorites of all time, but as far as gameplay ""DmC Devil May Cry"" is some of the most fun I have had actually playing a PS3 game.  The variation in combat and the awesome, epic boss battles, not to mention the large variety of lesser creatures each with its own strengths and weaknesses, make this highly entertaining.  Ninja Theory is a game company to keep on the radar, as they seem to be improving overall with each new release.

1476,52331,3,False,"05 8, 2004",AJ8VUUCO9RMX6,B00011V8EA,D.L.,"Video games based on movie licenses are always a hit or miss.  For every good game like ""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King,"" and ""Spiderman: The Movie,"" there is the horrible ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" and the mediocre, ""Enter the Matrix.""  ""Van Helsing"" falls somewhere in between. The game borrows heavily from ""Devil May Cry,"" complete with cinematic camera angles and fighting combos and weapons you can purchase after a level.  The graphics aren't especially detailed with low and blurry textures.  The XBOX version is sharper, but below standards for a system with that much graphical capability.  A treat is using the voice and likeness of Hugh Jackman as well as the other actors from the movie.  Gameplay is steady enough with one button used for projectile weapons such as Helsing's twin guns and another for close combat which when timed right, unleashes a series of combos on an enemy. The L trigger is used to target the enemy you're fighting.  However, the targeting system tends to focus on enemies farther away rather than the ones that are closer which can be frustrating since you need to toggle over and over. My biggest gripe are the camera angles.  Since it's fixed, judging where you're going can be very frustrating.  For instance, you may be walking towards one part of a room when all of a sudden, the camera angle will shift to a new perspective.  When this happened, I had to backtrack a few times just to make sure I was going in the right direction.  Fortunately, on boss levels, the camera angle is just about right, hovering from a nice distance that allows you to see where you're going. ""Van Helsing"" is by no means a bad game.  It's just...okay.  The graphics are nice, but not especially detailed.  Gameplay is basic and easy to learn.  The camera angles on the other hand, is a beast to contend with.

It comes with everything you need to get it going.  I suggest a wired connection to reduce typical issues that may arise from using WiFi, but either work fine.  If this is your first experience with the Xbox One I would suggest looking online for a set up tutorial.  Setup itself took me a hour or so as the user interface is different from the 360 and takes some getting use to. But now that I've been using it for two days I'm really beginning to appreciate the UI.  FYI - I have two turtle beach headsets connected (500X Stealth and X41) to the Xbox One.  The 500X is connected to the Xbox itself and the X41 is connected through my smart TV.  Both work simultaneously so two can use headsets together while playing on the Xbox One.  For the X41 I purchased the stereo headset adapter in order to use the chat. Remember to turn the adapters ""game""/""Chat"" balance all the way to chat as the game sounds will come through the X41s receiver. If you don't you may get some feedback or interference with game sound coming through the ""chat"" as well.  All in all I'm very pleased with this bundle. It worked flawlessly out of the box.

ENDLESS OCEAN is a game that bucks that trend and instead asks you to play for no other reason than to have fun.  That alone will cause many gamers to run for the hills screaming that the game is boring, but it isn't as long as you accept the game for what it is and not wish it to be like everything else.  At the beginning of the game you can choose to be a male or female diver and you play the game diving into the ocean looking for new and exotic life as well as exploring caves and such.  There are no time limits or goals, though you can choose to do the menial tasks your ships owner asks of you there is no reward or penalty for doing so.  You are also encouraged to gather information on the different forms of life you encounter and take pictures of them.  But the main point is to explore just for the fun of it and that's what I see as the genius of this game.  With such an esoteric reason for playing there's got to be something to keep the more traditional gamer entertained and that's where the graphics come into play.  Playing this game it's very easy to get lost in the world created because everything is so life-like and beautiful.  From enormous whales and tiny schools of fish to seaweed swaying in the water, the graphics really impress.  This is a game to show off how cool games can look on Wii.  That is as long as you stay in the water.  Things get more blocky and movements are noticeably jerky whenever you board your ship to save your game, receive instruction and talk to your ship mate.  As is typical for Wii, controls are easy to learn and intuitive.  Want to swim left?  Simply point the controller to the left hand side of the screen.  What could be easier than that?  The simple controls and laid back game play make this a game that is perfect for every member of the family.  Though it won't appeal to every gamer, this is a game that anyone with a sense of adventure and love of discovery will be completely enthralled by.  Those looking for new kinds of games to play need look no further than ENDLESS OCEAN.  Despite being slow by traditional standards and its uneven graphics, it's a game that's truly fun and unique.",Endless Possibilities,1204329600,90.0,,,ship female school score gather hand buck focus wii like hill graphic noticeably slow seaweed could simply come need swim traditional uneven receive world task whale perfect completely trend get high many whenever anyone member take something jerky simple mate different entertain form unique genius intuitive long discovery leave fun thing really owner that's menial play despite love new back control appeal gamers finish point sense beautiful ship reason blocky easy gamer lose adventure explore dive truly male boring item enormous goal game want exotic cool alone learn time screen impress limit game information get collect history accept everything explore reward movement game also talk kind standard see life-like water diver form esoteric easy else controller instruction side make choose main asks create encounter play begin cave penalty ocean endless scream story lay sway instead look though run life typical throughout board enthral there's tiny stay cause encourage well get show save every look keep fish family wish picture follow

1513,448977,3,False,"04 19, 2007",AGNGN6A4N5WV3,B000035XZZ,Kid Icarus,"A casual playing of the game reveals a very interestnig and intriguing story of a line of ""Drakkhen"", half human/half dragon families in feud and cross country trekking of a small group of four mousey wanting and happless humans. the  4 regions of: Ice(air), Swamp(water), Forest(earth), and Desert(fire) are on a rectangualr island each region ruled by 2 Drakkhens always one is evil one is not and in love with a foriner from another region of some sorts. I like the story and the 8 royalty line love/hate senario. Prince Naatakkhan(your main drako dude at near end game), his evil sis Princess Naatakkha(air), Hordken(the mixed emotioned questgiver who wants to ask you a few favors and ""kill"" you at the same time!), his sis Princess Hordkha, the captured one(earth), Haagkhaan(the zombie lover and who captured Hordkhen's sis),Princess Haagkha(benevoent queen sends you out for the tears and gives you a nice sword or three), the desert princess Haazuluka and her evil bro Haazulakaan who wants her dead. Sounds like bad Drakonic theater to me. However I seriously do have mixed feelings about the gameplay.  The castles are very gothic and well done, very good artwork and atmosphere(for the time); however, the out-of-doors, despite some reveiws on Game Encyclopidia are dull, monotonous, and of no interest except for the occasional random event or monster.  ""Exploring the outdoors for the sake of it"" as one revewer said, is completely and utterly pointless as all the trees/pines/cact/or ice burg letus are the same.  The music is awsome for a primitive barely out of NES SNES game.  a sort of funky digital slap bass or stun gitar, can't tell which coupled with the moog 70's disco/soul with a few medolic yet sad(sometime depressing in the swamp but very good quality) music that is emakulate considering limitations of the time(1991) the castles are more errie and gothic the emplemented music as a great additon to the already gothic atmospheric artword. Now SNES, also adding out-of-doors music not included in the PC version. the tracks are done by Hiroyuki Masuno and ""LSVD Programmer""  They quite probably also did Dungeon Master's SNES version and a Apple IIGS game I once played called ""Ancient Land of ""Ys"" because the style and sound is the same.  Though the out of doors is a time consuming trek of blank nothing and pointless houses of generic elves commenting about the weather or a late meeting and rarely useful, the Scout can utilies her teleport spell(though mine's intel seems a bit low and can never get to a decent level for mana) you will and cover much ground in minutes utilzeing ""teleportation spells"".  Land travel is quite literally an hour hoof'n it, top/bottom left/right and is completely pointless and a waste of valuble time. It is in a 3d setting and is quite nice for the limitations of a SNES as a vista of day/night cycles in all habitats and strange and brighter-than-most constellations that turn into monsters, to a point the land's view is nice, but then it is tedious and boring.  The high point is the music(MUZAK) and the RP character developement though 3 trys and your out if you have 3 superior characters and #4 stinks like a #2 then it is pointless and the prior 3 must be dumped if you want a decent 4.  You'd think after data east made that mistake Nintendo would let you reverse the last one.  this is the Kemco/Seika version(now just Seika) for Super Nintendo.

Each car is built of around 4,000 polys and takes 2 weeks to complete.  In Gran Turismo 2 it took very little time to complete each car.  GT3 had already been delayed around 4 times so would you want to wait any longer?  I think that 160 cars is a damn fine amount. Ok first Graphics.  What can I say? They are wonderful.  This game has the most realistic lighting and reflecting I have ever seen in a PS2 game, or PC game.  The cars near photo realism.  Trees and other objects reflect off of your car in real time!  No more pre-done reflections.  The sun can affect your driving too, just like in real life.  Its blinding.  In rally modes, dust from the other car billows off the road, coming from all four tires.  The dust doesnt dissapear right away, or stay coming up only a certain distance away from the car, it stays floating there for a while, like in real life.  If you drive through the dust, don't expect to see much. Now the game play.  Very good aswell! Set aside some time for this game because it will take some time to beat.  Many many many races to complete, and secret cars to earn.  Custom up your cars to make them faster and perform better.  Wash your car to improve aerodynamics, change the oil to make it run better. Buy new suspension, turbos, intercoolers, brakes, gearboxes, wheels, weight reduction and more!  But cars from, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, VW, Audi, RUF, Ford, BMW, Jaguar, Pagani and much more.  Secret cars include a Diablo GT, F094/H F1 car, F688/S F1 car and a F094/S F1 car.

In a lot of ways, this game at first seems like a rehash of the first two games: Collect all of the emeralds to destroy Robotnik's plans.  In this game, you also battle Sonic's similar counterpart named KNuckles.  However the main thing that makes this a GREAT LEAP forward from any of the previous games is that if you have the ""Sonic and KNuckles"" game, you can actually JOIN that and ""Sonic 3"" and combine the two game universes to create the ultimate video game adventure. How about that for a change!  In my opinion, it's the extremely innovative style of being able to join two video games togather to create one GRAND adventure that makes Sega Genesis the most memorable game system I've ever played. Being able to in fact join two games together is an example of video gamemaking that is beyond anything that ever came before then.  It's a pity that Playstation never had the brilliance to learn the uniquness of Sega Genesis and create a game that could join up with another game the way this and ""Sonic and Knuckles"" did.

First off, let me say that the whole violence sterotype is just stupid. Movies, music, and video games don't create psychos, they just make psychos more creative. Besides, the government tries to stop violent games like this, but they don't want to stop the real violence going on all over America. They need to stop blaming and start thinking of other solutions if they really care about stopping the violence(which they don't).Anyways, if you want to, you can drive around the city, the desert, the mountains, whatever. Or you could play the missions and get captivated in the surprisingly great story of the game. You can do hundreds of extra missions for money or just to do them. You can piss off the cops, and try to run from them. You can go on a rampage and shoot up your gang rivals' neighborhood. You can go around and take pictures of all of the great landscapes in this game. You can go to Driving School, Boating School, Biking School, Flying School. You can take your girlfriend out on a date. You can go out to eat, work out, buy new clothes, buy houses. You can even drive out to the mountains and take a vacation at your house. You can check out Area 51, you can go play Black Jack at the casinos in Las Venturas, or bet on horse racing in Los Santos. You can fly airplanes or jets and land them wherever you want to. I didn't even name a fourth of the things you can do. Playing this game is like playing a second life. You've got unlimited possibilities on what you want to do with you're character. The other thing is the cities in this game are basically street for street replicas of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Los Santos is like Los Angeles, half city life and half gang filled poverty. San Fierro is like San Francisco, very artsy and hilly. Las Venturas is like Las Vegas. That one you can easily tell as soon as you drive up there. The strip area where the casinos are is beauitiful. It's a very fun city. All other games take 20-40 hours or whatever to beat. This game takes much longer than that. But they're really is no beating this game. Don't think that if you don't fit the gangster lifestyle that this game portrays, then you won't like it, because you will. I know numerous amounts of people who live in two story suburbian houses and think that this is the best game ever. The story in this game is like a movie. It is very intelligent and very detailed. The missions are so much better than the other GTA games' missions. You do much more than just shoot people. I'm not saying that the other 2 games just had shoot em up missions, but they don't quite have the variety that this game has. So if your'e a fan of the other GTA games, you can't really call yourself a fan if you don't have this game. Don't get me wrong, Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City are probably the 2nd, 3rd best games of all time. This game is twice as good if you listen to any form of rap music while you're playing it. Some recommended albums are Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"", Snoop Dogg's ""Doggystyle"", 2pac's ""All Eyez On Me"", The Game's ""The Documentary"", and The Notorious BIG's ""Ready To Die"" and ""Life After Death"". But most of all NWA's Straight Outta Compton. But it's not required to have a blast playing this game. So, like I said, this game is on it's own level. There isn't one game that compares to it.

I got one preowned for $40 so at that price I think it was a good value, but at the regular retail of $100 or more I think it would be a let down.  When first booting up Kinect Adventures it is immediately impressive what you can do it is not until playing with two people for an extended period of time you experience its shortcomings.  I am playing at 6/7 fee away from the Kinect and per the calibration I have placed the sensor a little low but don't feel like reorganizing my entire entertainment center to accommodate a gaming accessory I use occasionally. I feel the space requirements are unrealistic and too specific.  The tracking two people at once while jumping ducking running and dancing is kind of buggy. Often while playing Kinect Adventures one person will get lost by kinect and than have to try an relocate them which is fine at first but gets annoying after a while. I also have Dance Central 3 which is the best dance game out when it works. It feels like the arm movements are very accurate but the leg movements seem to be hit or miss.

So knowing I could take this anywhere, the bathroom, my car, the kitchen, my bed and even in church (just kidding) I bought myself a PSP and picked up Hot Shots Golf Open Tee! I'm not a big expert on this system, but I was not expecting a little handheld to compare to the likes of Hot Shots Golf 3 or """"fore"""" on the PS2, but to my surprise, this game is like having the actual big games in the palm of your hand, and in some respects, it's better. The big plus with this game is the ease  and quickness of play. There are virtually no load times between holes and the gameplay is fast and responsive and looks pretty to boot. I can't believe how bright the game is.  The game plays terrific and I have to say ""If it's not broke, why fix it"" came into play with Hot Shots Golf Open Tee as the control scheme is identical to Hot Shots Golf 3 and Fore.  So if you have played 3 or Fore, you'll be right at home. The differences are in the courses and the new characters. You only have 6 courses to choose (in total) from this time, (which is pretty good for a handheld...) The characters are all new. I think there are at least 15 golfers and some secret ones too. The problem is that you only start out with 2 golfers and 1 course. Kind of the bare minimum especially if you don't want to take the time to earn the new ones, but you'll have to. That said, the game is substantially longer and grueling, but I like this aspect, because people with handhelds can kill some serious time. It takes about 5-7 matches to earn a new character. Most are only 9 holes in the beginning, but it still takes an eternity to earn new characters. Some might like this aspect, some may not. Along the way you earn new threads (wardrobes) hats, shirts, jewelery, shoes, etc. It took me about an hour to just earn the first secret character and a new course to play on!  The courses are all new and gives new freshness to the series. No more ""Sakura"" from past games which was one of my favorite courses, but these are very good too, and challenging to boot, Don't let the cheesy graphics fool you. Speaking of graphics...   The game is extremely fast pace and control for your swin is right on. You only press the X button in multiple sessions in Hot Shots Golf 3. It may still seem like old school control and maybe they should have given us more options, but even without the analog stick to control your swing, I still feel right at home with Hot Shots and you will too. For people that simply cannot line up your ""impact meter"" they offer an automatic swing too for people who can't do it so you could hand this over to your uncle John to play! Although this easier, they do punish people who use it by taking away power from your swing.  Wow, I never knew the PSP could look this good. Hot Shots Golf Open Tee looks amazing. Sure the zany characters are still annoying at times, but the overall look of Open Tee is a lot sharper and the backgrounds are very picturesque to boot! There are some magnificent use of photo backdrops that mesh with the golfing environments perfectly. After you play a game, ""while not important to the gameplay, you get doused with some full motion video of moving clouds and ocean tides running up along a beach,  wow! As you progress through a round of golf, you'll notice little added touches like day turning into dusk and dusk turning into day. Clouds move through the sky and rain starts to pour. The water holes, ponds, lakes etc...looks pretty darn real and it might want to make you want to take a swim.  So how is the sound? Well. They totally redid the music and it's all new stuff, and I have to say it meshes with the action perfectly and your headphones are a must! Cheesy comments from characters after crazy shots and good enviromental effects, but a bit skimpier than it's PS2 cousin. I need more birds ""a chirpin"".  Your caddies, while included, they never seem to make an appearance in the actual game, so I'm not sure why they are even a choice in the game? They don't even help you? Hmmm..  I don't know much about the technical aspects of the game, I have not tried to play it over a ""network"" as you are offered the option to play with 8 other golfers over a network ""LAN"" line.

The bad: it seems like this game is only 50 or 60% new material.  Basically the graphics, controls, sounds, and environments make this game super-fun and very replayable. However, the story isn't quite as cool as AC4. They replaced the great still art with cheesy looking CG. And answering my wingmen's questions during combat is not enjoyable either. You can't re-arm during missions anymore. This would be ok if they didn't give you seemingly near-impossible objectives in some of the missions.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a time where Lego games were made by various developers for mostly PC, mainly for young children as the audience.

Since then, it's become clear what the future of Lego games would be.  Lego Star Wars II carries what was set in stone in the original, and, well, utilized these elements in the setting of the original Star Wars trilogy. The movies have turned into galactic playgrounds and you guide your newly figurine-ized protagonists across famous locales and shoot, swing a Lightsaber, or smash stuff up and collect a million studs. The levels themselves are of a healthy length, and they often contain a lot of little puzzles for you to solve as you progress. They can involve things like finding a pile of bricks to build something, activating switches, switching characters for each one's abilities, and so on. The puzzles aren't often complicated, but they're satisfying to complete.  The game isn't perfect by any means, though. Since you have infinite lives, and spawn right beside where you died, players seeking challenge may be turned off. On another note, the cutscenes, while faithful to their source material, lack any dialogue, so it's hard to make sense of what some characters are trying to say, especially if you didn't watch the movies. Still, the game is charming action-platformer that suits the Lego and Star Wars franchises finely.

1572,366330,4,False,"10 4, 2014",A25QJBK33C4O0R,B00KWHOXGI,terpfan1980,"It's somewhat ironic that this showed up for me as an Amazon Vine offering *after* I had already ordered and received a 'Premium Value pack' version of this same product, along with a host of additional items including the Guardians of the Galaxy play set and a few extra figurines and power discs.  I was, obviously, all-in on Infinity 2.0, though I hadn't let myself get pulled into the Infinity world back in the 1.0 version other than to collect a couple of the figurines.  Disney Infinity, even in that earlier rendition, was somewhat ingenious (one of my friends and I were using the word devious) in how it appeals on so many levels.  Disney collectors can collect the figures just to display while others may be collecting the figures both for use in the game and for display and collecting.  Throw in the power discs and the play sets that offer new areas to play in and the appeal broadens further, and beyond that there's the Toy box mode for even more appeal and potential gaming satisfaction.  This starter pack offers gamers what they would need to get started in Disney Infinity 2.0's Marvel environment.  3 of the now infamous Marvel heroes are included: Thor, Ironman, and Black Widow.  Each nicely done though missing one key aspect that some collectors might look for as they are not movable (non-articulated) in their poses.  They are not exactly like their movie representations, but are close enough to both the movies and the comics to be instantly recognizable.  For those that aren't familiar with the Disney Infinity environment, the figures double as your playing piece for use in the video game environment.  Players pick one of the figures to use to select that character within the gaming environment and then place that figure on the Infinity base which is connected to the gaming console.  The Infinity base reads electronics that are in the base of the figure (or in the power discs) to determine which character should be used as which player in the game, or which additional options should be available to that player within the game.  The Infinity base has two separate player slots on it, and a third spot for where the play set activator goes.  The play set activator determines where the players will be playing, or which story the players will be working within.  With the 2.0 series, the Marvel Super Heroes move into the spotlight, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  More play sets will be available along the way as each play set offers yet more playability to gamers and also offers Disney the opportunity to sell more of the collectible figures.  With the 1.0 series Infinity seemed to be oriented much more towards younger children while the 2.0 series opens up lots of possibility for (Marvel) comics fanboys (and girls) of all ages.  Fans of the comic book characters get to explore the environment and smash, bash, blast and shoot bad guys as they work to save the universe from the evil that would otherwise rule.  The only real problem in that area, and one that helps lead to the less than 5 star rating here, is that the play set environments and stories are fairly short.  Serious gamers will fly through (no pun intended there) the play set within a 4 - 5 hour period in many cases and then be left feeling that they got ripped off a little on the game playability.  Having other play sets available helps to eliminate that problem, but those play sets typically come at a cost of approximately 1/2 of the price of the original starter pack.  (Of course the play sets also include additional figures which would normally sell separately for about 1/2 the cost of a play set)  Fans of the Disney Infinity 1.0 series, or people that had collected the figures and play sets will find that they can use the figures within the toy box mode when playing in the Infinity 2.0 environment.  The play sets from 1.0 are not compatible with 2.0, and the figures and play sets from 2.0 are not backwards compatible with the 1.0 environment.  In some instances the 2.0 figures may not be completely cross compatible with all of the play sets (as an example, the Hulk character can't be used in all of the 2.0 play sets, and the Rocket character from Guardians doesn't work in all environments either).  For those that aren't aware, there is a Collector's edition (PlayStation 3 or 4 only) that adds a display base.  That display base is NOT used within the game, rather it just offers a nice base to display your figures on.  That set also includes the otherwise as yet unavailable (outside of auctions and third party sales) Hulk figure.  That figure will be available for separate sale late October 2014.  One other consideration that comes into mind is that in order to use this item you'll need to have room for setting the Infinity base up and will also need a USB port available on your PS4 (also compatible with the PS3, though then you'd need the software for same) to plug your base into.  If you are space constrained in the area where your console is set up, you may find it frustrating having to plug the Infinity base in.  You can plug the base into a USB hub if you want/need to, but that would add the need to purchase same (separately).  Besides the somewhat disappointing play set average game times, the cost of buying the power discs and figures and/or the pre-arranged packages of figures that don't always include the combination of characters you might otherwise have preferred factors into the not quite perfect 5.0 rating here.  I do like being able to mix and match by getting separate figures and play sets, but those costs do keep adding up.

To me, the battle system relies too much on the the auto-battle button. Sure, you can can pick the abilities yourself, but this just isn't practical later on in the game. Most of the strategy lies in split second decisions in switching your roles and this does lead to some intense moments but i prefer a battle system more like the one used in 10.   The story to me was good but not great. It just didn't have the emotional impact of other games in the series. I thought the ending was great but it could have been amazing if some earlier things were done better in the story. Some people have complained about the game ""not being finished"" and yes it does say to be continued but the game does tell a pretty complete story for the two main characters and whats happening with other characters can been found out in the game, I think people that say this haven't gotten to 100% completion. The dlc thats going to come out sounds like it's going to be side story's and not come after the ending so it's not like you have to buy it to complete the story.

1598,493401,5,False,"12 1, 2017",A10W2QTBTVV6RQ,B00SMOAGPK,Jessie Scott,"Note: I bought the 3DS version on Nintendo's eShop as it was $20 cheaper.  Terraria is originally a game for PC that was ported to consoles.  The port, overall, is great, but there are some issues with controls.  The game itself is basically the same as the PC version; you start out by chopping down some wood, build a little home, and then explore your guts out while chopping down monsters with various weapons and tools.  It's a classic building/survival/action platformer ala Minecraft.  However, Terraria is more action/adventure than it is building/crafting.  As you progress, you get better tools, can explore further, defeat stronger monsters, and get cooler rewards, thus repeating the process.  The music remains the same.  The audio is still full of chirps, grunts, and chiptunes.  It's like playing an old NES or SNES game.  The smaller screen means the graphics a shrunk down a bit.  This actually works in Terraria's favor as it makes the pixels look less, well, pixel-y.  It produces a sharper, more defined image.  The top screen is where all the magic happens.  The bottom screen servers multiple functions.  Bottom Screen Function 1: Hotbar.  The default screen is your hotbar, quick deposit (stack things in chests that already have at least 1 in it), and the ability to switch between the other modes.  You can use L and R to swap between the items or you can tap on the item to use it.  This is actually harder than it sounds though, especially when enemies can pop up at anytime.  You might be mining and then suddenly there is a skeleton.  You have to look at the bottom screen, select the weapon you want to use, and then proceed to attack the enemy.  Bottom Screen Function 2: Item Management.  Luckily, on the 3DS version, the game can be paused (unlike PC).  By going into your backpack, the game pauses while you fiddle around with your stuff.  You can move items around and set your hotbar.  Whatever item you have highlighted when you exit will be what you're equipped with back on the top screen.  This is nice as you can go into your backpack, select a weapon, then head back out to attack whatever monster is trying to eat you.  Bottom Screen Function 3: Building!  This is really the top reason to enjoy Terraria on 3DS (other than it being an excellent game): you can build on the bottom screen.  While this screen is active, you see a grid overlaying a close up of your top screen area. You can place blocks or walls anywhere on the bottom screen.  While handy, this impairs your ability to fight and prepare for fights. The building (or mining) precision has some flaws that make it hard to quickly switch to fighting.  This is where there is some confusing controls for the bottom screen (and a few controls that make no sense).  There is no rebinding keys; what is set is what you get.  For the most part, the normal controls work great.  Y to use your equipped item, B to Jump, A to Use/Action, and X to lock target (super handy).  But there are some questionable choices in the item management screen.  For instance, when interacting with a chest and trying to get inventory sorted out, X sends an item to the trashcan.  Wait, what?  Why?  I have no idea.  Instead, the devs thought it would make more sense to set a face button to trash and you have to physically tap the bottom screen to send an item to the chest.  Yet when you're in the chest, X takes the item out and Y takes everything out.  That's right: X in backpack = trash, X in chest = trash.  I've thrown away good items before because of this.  Maybe it's just me, but I use the trash less than I use my chests to store items.  Besides that, an item has one chance to be removed from the trash before it's gone forever.  There is no confirmation, no indication that your item is in the trash nor that it will be overwritten by another item.  The only way to tell is noticing the item's small icon before it's too late.  Why is this such a big deal?  Because our normal gaming logic would have the controls reversed.  Throwing away dirt you dug up?  No big deal.  But throwing away precious ore or an important item you needed for later is infuriating.  With no way to change the default controls, you're stuck with trying to go against instinct to avoid throwing away important and valuable items during the numerous and mandatory inventory sorting that must be done.  Despite my frustration with a few of the controls, this is a fantastic game with infinite replayability.  Once you're bored -- or know all the nooks and crannies -- from one world, you can simply create another.  Hunt down all the bosses and unlock the higher difficulty.  Craft powerful weapons and armor to face Terraria's most fearsome enemies.  And if you have friends who: a) own a 3DS and b) own their own copy of Terraria, you can kill, build, and survive together.  I would give this a 9/10 overall, but since it's a 5 star scale, I think it deserves the full merit.

Haunting Ground is a bit different than the other games in the genre by two things: you don't stand and fight the antagonists, and the addition of a great sidekick-- a dog named Hewie.  You play the game as a teenaged girl named Fiona. You roam around this creepy mansion trying to find your way out, while getting chased by subnormals and mentally deranged ""people"". I use the term people loosely and you'll see why when you play.  Instead of fighting, you run and hide from your pursuers. Through the game you pick up items to use against your enemies that will stun them to buy you some time, but for the most part you just try to avoid the creepy people.  This part of the gameplay was novel, but did get annoying at times. There were points in the game where I was sick of running and really just wanted to beat the crazy out of the thing chasing me.  There are fun puzzles to solve and I liked roaming around the creepy mansion. I also enjoyed having Hewie as my sidekick.

After all, it was originally going to be a new Rayman platforming adventure for the Wii, but then as development progressed, the people at Ubisoft realized that they could do all sorts of twisted things with the Wii Remotes' functionality. Worse, certain elements that were promised to be in the game were left out, making the game feel like as if it rushed onto store shelves to be a launch title.  Still, playing the game can make a big difference about my expectations, and fortunately enough, the handheld versions of the game are in fact platforming games. I reviewed the GBA version already, and now I'll be looking at the main course (And of course I'll also review the DS version).  Anyway, the story is that the Rabbids have invaded, and they imprisoned Rayman for him to be a gladiator slave. During his slavery, Rayman must go through a bunch of ""trials""  (aka minigames) to satisfy the Rabbids. In fact, they do genuinely buy into Rayman's shtick, and make his prison cell fancier and more homely as the game progresses. However, Rayman being captured and trying to escape is literally all there is to the plot. For a pre-Origins game, this sure has the thinnest story.  But we're not quite here for the story, are we? Nah, we're here for kooky Rabbids antics! Before minigame collections flooded the Wii's library, Rayman was there to open the door for them, and believe it or not, this game does manage to be a pretty fun minigame collection, even after all these years since its release. The variety was all over the place, ranging from Rayman throwing pigs, jumping a chain rope, kicking a Rabbid like a soccer ball, shutting restroom doors, and my favorite, shooting off Rabbids in on-rails FPS-style levels.  As fun as a lot of these are, the game does have its duds. I was totally not a fan of that one minigame where you had to cross a mine-filled area and can only detect it through the Wii Remote speaker when I'm just about to go that way. There were also minigames like the Rabbid Dentist one that felt more disturbing rather than funny.  Nevertheless, if you want a polished Wii minigame collection, Raving Rabbids is worth your time. Those that want an actual Rayman game out of this should either go play the GBA/DS versions of the game.",Bunnies Don't Review Games,1413763200,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},,launch gladiator shut i'll door minigames shtick onto quite remote wii way plot like imprisoned wii's ball behind-the-scenes however ds rabbids rayman's dentist development could ubisoft rope twist open jump shoot area title realize fancy antic favorite on-rails soccer bad enough restroom big sure make element already we're kooky remote speaker totally know feel must fortunately rave leave trial aka review fun thing polish course one fact manage play cross lot new progress rayman place funny functionality mine-filled try slave go believe rather adventure satisfy pre-origins worth gba collection disturb first rush version game want certain variety version cell kick time minigame prison shelf backstory actual progress buy level duds game also fan felt sort promise still anyway literally even flood concerned year release nah escape game's make captured gba/ds main nevertheless either store genuinely play door i'm since fps-style range story homely rabbid thin detect invade bunch handheld platforming people originally slavery go throw pig library difference collection look expectation chain pretty review

The PSP kind of faltered and even though it did okay in the long run I lost interest in it early on.  If you came to the PSP later in its life that's a good thing.  For me the PSP was a let down in its infancy because it didn't quite deliver on its promise (implied or not) that it was a PS2 in your hands.  I spent the next many years with my DS->DS Lite->DSi as my handheld of choice.  Enter the Vita.  I spent quite a bit of time with it yesterday upon receiving it and this time Sony got it right.  They promised again that this would be like having a home console in your hands and for a console that hasn't yet hit it stride and doesn't have developers fully optimizing for it... the end result is pretty amazing.  Maybe I shouldn't be amazed as more and more smartphones have been doing great things graphically.  The issue with smartphone gaming though is touch control alone is maddening.  I can't play adventure or platform games without either a D-pad or an Analog control stick.  It's way too imprecise and ends up just not being fun as you can't make the game do what you really intend.  The Vita solves that while giving you even more innovative control schemes by recreating home console style controls on a handheld but adding in a front and back touch interface that adds a little more depth to tired old touch controls.  This isn't the end all device and it has its flaws for sure, but I was prepared to be let down by the Vita and I was definitely impressed by what they were able to deliver.  The First Edition Bundle comes with a case that is pretty nice... my only real complaint about it is there is no place to put other memory cards.  The bundle comes with a 4GB card and I bought a 16GB card.  So I fashioned a card holder out of the two plastic holders that held the cards in place in their original packaging.  Then trimmed it down so it would fit in one of the game card slots in the case.  Pros: It really feels like 360/PS3 style gaming in a handheld The OS is optimized for touch and mimics a smartphone Even though the price is higher than a 3DS I don't feel like I didn't get my money's worth especially with the bundles Sony offered The launch lineup had quite a bit to offer most people and it looks like they are trying to spread big titles out in the coming year It really lends itself to growing and changing to provide new features and services as they upgrade the OS along the way  Cons: It's a little pricier than some might want to pay for a handheld (but worth it I promise!) The OS while optimized for touch doesn't let you use the D-pad or buttons for input at all... that kind of sucks Setting up 3G on the system is a nightmare... just do it on AT&T's website Oh and that brings up AT&T... the pricing for 3G makes no sense and Sony will have to give me a better reason to pony up money each month for it as right now they haven't made it a must have feature. Some might think the battery life is a Con but at around 5 hours of actual use it's worth having such a powerful system. The screen is plastic and not glass... I have to wonder if Sony just wants to sell their own screen protectors Which brings us to Sony wants to sell their own memory... it's a typical Sony move but it could have been worse (I guess)  One more thing to note... on the memory card front.  I actually got the 16GB card and I cringed to pay so much for what I know should really be costing me $20 tops if it was microSD memory.  I installed a PSP game, a Vita PSN game, and 3 Vita full size demos and I still have 10GB left.  I think 8 to 16GB will be fine for most people.  The 4GB seems too small for most use cases and the 32GB seems a little too large unless you really just want to go all digital download.  All in all I'd say most people would be happy with the Vita.  It has a definite place between smartphone and home console that gives an excellent balance of some freedom without sacrificing what you're used to playing at home on your big screen tv.

My goal was to purchase the official PS3 headset[...]. Unfortunately, it was sold out everywhere UNLESS I went with the bundled Socom:Confrontation package. I'd read very mixed, mostly negative reviews, but I figured the bugs had been fixed by way of patch and it was really popular Sony exclusive, so there would be a community that would be able to help me figure it out. [...]  The headset works great - in fact, it's awesome. First party peripherals rarely dissappoint and I reccomend it if you are using brand x.  Socom:Confrontation is garbage. It has a lengthy patch after the lengthy download. It promptly froze the first time I booted up. And the second. Once in the main menu, you will find absolutely NOTHING in way of tutorial or explination. There are no training missions and no option to play against bots. The ONLY option is to go straight online. Not only does this suck for people new to the game, but for those who are already online, it's no fun having people jump in that are totally clueless.  Once online, using my nifty new headset I said ""what's up guys, I'm new to the game, any pointers?"" I was promtly booted. Next game I wondered about, picked up five kills (lead the room in kills) and was promptly booted as soon as the next match started. These were 8 (of a possible 32) people matches. The quality of players was sketchy and I checked [...] and there were only 9500 people globally playing. Compare this to 350,000 people playing Killzone 2 at any given time or 900,000 playing 2 year old COD:MW in any week. I gave it a few hours and found the game boring and maps nearly empty. Furthermore, even an experienced gamer will get wrecked by experienced players in any given game (I pwn on Killzone, but get pwned in COD). There aren't a lot of players and on a weekend over the course of several hours, no skilled players that made me think I was outclassed.  The actual nuts and bolts play isn't bad. Playing 3rd person is differnt after 1000's of hours playing in the first person, but it's okay. The graphics are last generation. I understand that this is a PSP game ported to PS3, but this is really terrible. The load out is simple enough, but in most of the matches I joined, I had equipment that was restricted and I almost always played with whatever the host wanted me to play with. The pacing is MUCh slower than COD and Killzone 2, in my opinion, too slow. After having played games that require thought AND move very fast, whipping up on the SOCOM players felt almost unfair. Again, the quality players seemed to be playing something else.  When you play Killzone or see videos of COD:MW2 running, it really makes you wonder who Sony and Slant 6 thought would play this game. Graphics aren't everything, but Socom is not user friendly, it is not something you can pick up and play and offers nothing to entice new players to comeback and get better (hence the few number of people playing). I thought there was no way Socom could possibly be as bad as some of the reviews and it's my favirote genre of games. Turns out the negative reviews were right on. This is a bad game.

You had plenty of weapons and gadgets to help you along the way.  The Artificial intelligent characters was easier to get around and defeat.  You can knock out an enemy or kill them most of the time.  Your score determines how you play the game.  If you play silently your score goes up.  If you play killing the enemy or getting caught your score goes down.  Its your choice.  The sounds are awesome.  You can hear the enemy talk to each other and the environments is amazing.  Gameplay is easier than the previous two games.  If your caught the game doesn't end.  It just makes the enemies alot more difficult to get past as they will be more alerted to your presence.  The controls are tight.  Its pretty easy to control your character.  There is an in game manual with video's on how to use your guns, gadgets, and controls.  You don't really need to look at the instruction manual.  But the graphics take a hit.  This game was released at the same time for the Xbox, PC, and Gamecube.  The Xbox and PC are superior.  Its difficult to see in the shadows, darkness and dealing with security camera's.  The developers could have modified the graphic engine like they did in the previous two games made for the PS2 but they didn't.  The Story is great and the voice acting is fantastic.  You can save at any time but save often.  They do offer a co-op campaign and its split screen.  A few stages that takes place during the single player campaign.

I was amazed by the graphics and the plot of the game. The monsters are very creepy and how some times they would just show up write there after you come out of a room.  The game has 4 or 5 levels. Because the last one. I'm not sure if it is considered a level. were you have to leave somewhere and walk/run to a house and fight the last boss. But the game starts with having to save a girl(I forget her name) from a burning house and after that you wake in the deserted town of Silent Hill. you then find a map of the town and you have to then go to the hospital. after you get a sample of what the game is you then have to go to a Sanitarium, but on the way there you get to meet the main villain for most of the game. then after having to go through the whole building you have to fight and kill your own mom. Next you have to get to the theater. There you will meet a creature that will make you shake every time you see it in a hall. You then deal with the last boss who later becomes a common creature you have to deal with.

Graphics (Excellent): The graphics are vibrant and beautiful. Some sections are so cool to look at I simply explored and took it all in. Most sections are too scary for me to do this in without wetting myself. This game is definitely rated M for mature. You will see blood, mutilation and futuristic weapons plus tech. All of which looks as smooth as a high class horror movie.  Game Play (Excellent): I would describe the game play as a mixture of frantic and tense. The controls respond well and do exactly what you want. Most of the time this involves dismembering mutated scary creatures in to smaller pieces. Don't worry though you'll constantly be tripped up with new interesting ways to be scared and challenged for this every changing and growing game. Leveling up and purchasing items is also available and necessary in this game. There are stores throughout the game where you can purchase or trade guns, ammo, health packs and more. There is also the ability to level up guns (increase clip size, power of weapon ect...) or armor. On top of all that there is also a telekinesis powers. All this equates to giving the player a cool RPG feel without losing the nail biting pace of a shooter. Side note the game is played from a 3rd person perspective.  Story (Excellent): The game is basically a sci-fi horror movie except it's one of the rare good ones. You're an engineer on a space ship on a routine repair mission for a massive mining ship that has mysteriously lost all communications (which is never good). This is except for a brief tele-communication from your ex girlfriend. You'll soon find yourself engulfed in a struggle for life and a quest to find you ex. The problem is you have to rely on the other survivors of your repair crew and some don't seem trustworthy. Needless to say things get hectic fast and the pace keeps moving thru this multi-layered game.

1725,328008,1,False,"01 28, 2014",APFCXOFX0KUPN,B00F8ZQPWO,--,"This was a long awaited title and one of the most hyped launches of its kind ever, and for that reason I found it brutally disappointing. Its just 2-bit gangsters in LA California all over again. Somewhere new would have been nice for starters. The location and the plot is just too repetitious for a title this big! So why not change the theatre to Space, Underwater, History? I don't care, just something new! Why not be brave and even set the next game in.......China: ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Don't like those? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Still don't like any of those? Then how about Japan or Dubai? Either way folks, treat yourselves to some travel, you definitely have the resources!  The same 2-bit characterless gangster portrayals bring few surprises either. In fact this game does no one any favours. Hello? The world has moved on! My lady has a suggestion for a change of plot. Why not use the film Taken (2008) as a base? ...Justifiable on-screen violence against bad guys trafficking women. There's an emotional angle too for anyone interested in emotioneering in video-gaming! It would be better than dumb gangsters bring cynical corporate profits! Some people might think this is unduly harsh, but the video gaming talent pool is unbelievably high. However, GTA V is more like Hollywood and its endless cycle of reboots, reshoots and sequels.  Sure, the GTA V map terrain is a little more detailed, the mountains have higher peaks, and the cars look and handle a bit better. But Driver-SF still pips it with a higher frame-rate, and Saints Row III is just more fun. The rest is just bland, bland, bland. They've long run out of ideas, much like the twin-studios that kick out Call-Of-Duty titles every year on a corporate schedule! Yes, there are 3 GTA characters to follow this time, each with their own special skill, but its so gimmicky its not even half-hearted RPG. Overall, 3 messes just make more of a mess! No thanks!  ======================================== Update April 2014 ========================================  To those who argue the graphics are great and that negative reviewers have never played the game...  First off the graphics aren't first rate. They were back in 2008 with GTA4 maybe, but not now! At best GTA5's graphics are an incremental improvement over GTA4, but not enough considering the long development time. There are now vastly superior open-world driving titles with better graphics such as Driver-San Francisco, and even that isn't anything new. (And no, I'm no fan of Ubisoft and their DRM from hell before you ask).  The graphics are poor in GTA5 and its because they've failed to develop their Rage engine. You can see it in the frame Rate and Rendering. During a chase scene especially, the graphics of GTA lack clarity and are more blurry than Driver-SF, and this is primarily because the frame rate is much lower in GTA, and because the rendering system lacks clarity!  Its possible there are more meshes and varying terrains and landscapes with more animations in GTA. But Driver-SF is just more clever in how it renders the scene, and ultimately this is a high-paced driving game and so clarity really matters. The game could have been improved upon before release. But I think the development team have become decadent and lazy because of past success. Also, a lot of their better developers have left, especially in Rockstar North!  I played the game for 60+ hours, so I think that counts as having played it. Yes, there's a lot to do as there was in the GTA3 series and which GTA4 lacked. But its all very repetitive and not well thought out. In short there's nothing new here, and it lacks the charm of earlier titles. For example aircraft in the game still handle poorly. And while you can steal a jet from the military base and take it for a ride, you only get seconds of fuel to go joyriding! The tanks are too slow and boring too and there's only incremental improvement in the bikes and cars. I prefer driving real cars in open-world driving games, and there's too few exotic and interesting cars in this franchise to keep my attention. Who wants to drive a Truck? This is a video game, so I want to drive a Ferrari!  Don't get me started about the AI either. Rockstar just haven't done anything new in this area. Player actions on the city are non-existent also, and this is a wasted opportunity if ever there was one.  There's a lot of swearing because the game is shallow with its never ending 2-bit gangster portrayals. The earlier series had lots of swearing too but they had more charm. When swearing exists just to hide a dearth of new ideas, that's when the series becomes stale and should be dropped.",Italy?... China?... Underwater?.... Space? ...

The game's graphics don't look very good for a game released in 2010, it looks more like a PS2 game. The entire game is just trying to catch up to the prince's brother which is kind of silly. The entire game takes place inside of a palace until the end, when it goes outside of the palace. The game looks like one big level, so that was kind of disappointing. You encounter creatures that you have to kill which they are easy to kill. I only died a few times during the game and only one was because of the final boss, the rest were from falling. The camera is sometimes annoying, like most games and the controls are a little weird. One of the good things about this game is the powers that you earn. Freezing water, turning back time, and making things appear that aren't there anymore. It gets a little old after a while and sometimes confusing when you have to use all of your powers in a certain order to get somewhere. You also unlock upgrades that you can buy. Most of them don't seem like they do anything, except for the health upgrades. There really isn't any replay value to it, unless you want to get all of the trophies which are pretty easy to get.  Once you are done with the game, you can play two challenge modes which seem easier than the game. One is killing 8 waves of enemies and the other is killing a certain amount of enemies in a certain amount of time. The only reasons to play these are for the trophy or to get more upgrade points. This game also connects to U Play so you can unlock things by completing things in the game.

In the beginning they were great challenging games, but after a while they got very difficult with impossible times runs and races that were frustrating and unbeatable. I've been complaining for years about this problem. Well, TT must have been listening because all of those issues are gone in Jurassic World.  As with all Lego games the object is to collect studs like crazy. Jurassic World is loaded with opportunities to get studs. More objects to break and big rewards for completing a task. Second, you'll need to find characters, vehicles, solve puzzles, find or create dino's, find red bricks, find mini-kits, find a lot of gold bricks, and win timed events. There is a ton of action and things to do packed into Jurassic World. You will need to explore and play on 4 different islands, each representing one of the major action films.  Moving around is very easy. Within an island world there are open hub areas and levels. You can run around, drive a vehicle, or warp to different areas once you have unlocked a location. You can also use the chopper, a boat, or a tramway if you wish. Art work is amazing and the world of the Jurassic period is beautifully rendered. The creatures are also very well rendered, and they did an excellent job of reproducing the locations familiar from the films. As usual, as you play through you will learn the capabilities of each creature and use their skill to complete tasks and levels. As you find Red Bricks you can activate the bonus extra, A nice and welcome touch is that once you activate a Red Brick extra, it stays ON. Unlike in past games where you had to remember before starting to play to go in and turn them back on. You will need studs to buy the Red Brick extra once it is found, and you will need studs to buy characters and vehicles.  I found that the game play was challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. There are many things you need to do in order as you gain more abilities, and unlock different powers or creatures. Finding some of the red bricks is a real challenge. Once you get the Bonus Extras for the Red Bricks and Gold Bricks and Mini-Kits it makes it a bit easier to know they are there. Then you can figure out how to get to them. The best part of all was that TT games made the timed runs or races winnable. Some were a bit of a challenge, but most were winnable with some basic skills. The hardest one was the boat race near the heliport. Its long and the boat wants to over react to your steering commands, and controls flip from side to side as you go up and down which throws you off and makes you fail. A few of the vehicle ones are full of crazy obstacles which you keep crashing on or getting stuck on, but keep trying and recalling where they are and you'll get through without too much difficulty. Character control was excellent.  I had a ton of fun playing this game. I am very pleased that TT games listened to our concerns and made the required changes to the timed runs and races. I did not experience any Xbox One issues at all. No hanging, no corrupted files. All I can say is that the operators are probably doing something wrong like exiting before a game is saved or pressing multiple buttons at once. The only thing of note at all was the load times are a little lengthy. But if you want all of that gorgeous art work, then you have to be patient. If I had to have them change one thing it would be to put the name of the movie next to the island or on the badge in the map. I was not familiar with the symbols used for each film and had to enter into a world to see which one I was in.

It was perfect for me. It was a strongly tinted clear blue hard case that had two sections and a single tab in the front which released those flaps. The top portion held a few DS cartridges and an extra stylus, while the bottom held the handheld itself. The entire interior was insulated with a soft rubber-like material. It was perfect, except for one flaw. That mentioned tab in the middle was pretty thin so after a couple of years it would break right down the middle, preventing the case from remaining shut, thus rendering the case's primary function (to keep the handheld safe inside) relatively dysfunctional.  I bought another of the same case right away, fearing they wouldn't make it anymore and convincing myself it was a fluke. Thankfully I found one of the last ones at my local Kmart but, again, a couple of years later the same issue happened.  So I finally caved in and looked on Amazon. The top-rated DS Lite case was the same one I found when I initially looked for cases. The main reason it didn't attract me was the big brand name on top and no middle flap to separate the top from the bottom. But I caved and ordered one, hoping this would be the last DS Lite case I ever order.  It's mostly the same as the previous cases I had. The outer shell seems to be made of the same material, as well as the interior insulation. I did notice that the inside produced a distinct smell when first I opened it, and the smell still lingers even after a few years. The top holds DS cartridges, though I don't really carry around my games anymore since I restrict myself to one game when I'm on the go. Still, for those that carry games please note that only four of the six slots are used for DS cartridges. The other two, the ones in the middle, are used for SD cards. Why they did that is beyond me. Does the DSi carry SD cards? If so, I can't imagine people will be carrying more than one with them.  The bottom of the top holds a spare stylus in case you need it, which is where I put one of the two styli my DS came with.  The closing and opening button is a lot better than the previous cases', and I can tell I probably won't have to fear with it breaking.

I am a gamer and I love most types of games, but the genre I love most (RPG) is an area that PSP sorely lacks. There are a few good titles, sure, but nothing compared to the plethora of RPG's available on the DS. Plus, the DS has tons of ""just for fun"" games like Nintendogs, Cooking Mama, Clubhouse Games, etc. PSP, not so much.  PSP also proclaims itself as an all-in-one device. You can play games, watch movies, browse photos, surf the web, all in this one little device! Let me tell you, the one and only thing that the PSP really does well, is play games. The web browser on PSP is a complete joke. It's miserably slow, even when connected to cable, the controls are really awkward and not intuitive at all, and there is no flash support. It has plenty of other issues, but those are the main ones. I was SO excited to be able to browse on my PSP from the couch, and within a few days I was tired of torturing myself and stopped using it altogether.  As a means to storing and display photos, I suppose it does a decent job. But let's be honest, if you have a digital camera with a view screen, browsing photos on your PSP isn't really any different than viewing them straight from your camera. It's fine if you want to have a custom wallpaper for your PSP or just store some photos of family and friends to keep with you all the time, but don't expect more than that.  As a video player, it does a fine job except that you have to re-purchase all your movies on UMD. What a colossal waste of money! If you have even the slightest knowledge about these things, you can quickly figure out how to rip the DVD's you own into a file that you can then play on your PSP. Then you don't have to buy all those silly UMD's that will be obsolete in a few years anyway! And you don't have to carry them around with you either. Win win, right? The only downside to that is the lack of storage on the PSP. It simply wasn't meant to store much of anything on it's limited memory. If you want to bring movies with you, you're going to have to invest in some memory cards, which run about $50 for 16gigs, which will hold MAYBE 4 movies. After buying your PSP and two 16gb memory cards, you've spent $300. For that, you could have picked up an Archos 5 (or possibly COWON Q5) with 60gb of storage, larger screen, better sound quality, better picture quality, and great web browser WITH e-mail support!  All in all, the point I'm trying to make is, if you want a multi-media device for pictures, videos and web surfing, PSP is NOT the answer. By the time you've bought all those memory cards to store all your photos/videos/music, you could have purchased a device that is dedicated to those purposes and does them all much better than the PSP ever could. The PSP is a gaming device, nothing more. It can dabble in these other areas, but don't buy a PSP thinking it's going to meet all your multimedia needs. It will not.  When considering the choice between the PSP and the DS, I would just suggest that you look at the game libraries for each system and pick the one that has the most titles that appeal to you. They are both great gaming systems. If you can afford to have both, go for it! As gaming devices, you won't be let down by either one.","PSP is a gaming device, not a multi-media warehouse!",1228262400,2.0,,,player fall knowledge nice away all-in-one rip think female afford awkward card much couch view title storage maybe bright umd rpg's consider genre type cook meet lack excite like proclaims ever ds graphic straight slow custom simply could figure fine nintendogs connect one multimedia job stereotypical hold area clubhouse can't least video nothing spend photos many thing within expect system seem pick ton big sure tired great buying device different cable mean downside possibly movie money suppose obviously archos well intuitive e-mail altogether store fun friend little thing umd's really silly suggest picture one play cowon joke love psp tell stop file control waste memory quality appeal answer right gamers perspective point compare beautiful let far try large picture likely plethora gamer good able colossal limit wallpaper go win geared quickly sorely videos dabble day comfortable male let's lack digital flash game want watch display screen time obsolete multi-media purchase game slight dvd's would pleased buy issue etc browse also game decent torture complete anyway area honest even surf photos/videos/music dedicate mainly shell plenty mama re-purchase purpose except year sound surf make buy rpg main either plus view bring short pick needs choice i'm around two meant look system run device browse expect compete web miserably go well use available invest library library carry anything family keep store browser camera support

1796,152895,5,False,"11 21, 2008",A22CN41VJRVDOP,B0012N746W,Nemesis296,"I've been a fan of Tomb Raider ever since I was young with the classics, and the mechanics of gameplay, puzzle-solving and combat seem to always work pretty damn well for the folks at Eidos. The same is true with the latest installment of the series, Tomb Raider: Underworld.  The game starts out by informing you of a video that ties the story together, which right away gives you the impression that this game is going to actually have a point, instead of just ""Let's go to this random place for this artifact that existed thousands of years ago."" Lara actually has a plan, and she is attempting to fulfill that plan. While you start off with the basic tutorial inside Lara's mansion, it's surprisingly on fire, and I won't spoil anything here, but there's a plot twist on why.  You dive right into the classic Tomb Raider puzzles almost immediately, but this time there have been a few twists and extras added. As was said in the preview, the environment feels more realistic. The PS3 does a tremendous job of providing seamless gameplay and Lara's movements are just absolutely amazing. Lifelike almost, as not only does her hair flutter across her back when she runs, jumps, flips, etc, but there also is a sense of how she interacts with the environment. She gets dirty from climbing all those walls, and a simple jump into a pool of water, and she's all clean again.  In addition to the tremendous visual effects seen which will really give you a ""WOW"" factor each time you enter the next big room with architecture and another mind-boggling puzzle to solve, you sometimes can really get lost in the world of Tomb Raider, which is exactly what the developers intended. Underworld also has this sense of freedom to it, as you no longer have to go ""ONE WAY"" to get to your destination. You'll find multiple paths to get where you need to go, and each one has multiple secrets to find, which some are very cleverly hidden.  Another addition here, is multi-room challenges. You enter a room and hit a switch which opens a gate somewhere else, then you spend 45 minutes working on the next puzzle which ends up eventually sending you back out to solve the first puzzle. Like I said, you can solve them in any order you like, but the game has this sense of doing it yourself instead of ""Oh man, not this again.""  The combat and movement systems have all been refined too. Lara can now jump off walls and chimney up to the top of platforms, she can hang off a wall and shoot a gun with one hand, holding the ledge with the other. She has all new melee moves and plenty of other tricks that are sure to impress any puzzle junkie like myself. Her motorcycle is also a tool that can be used, and the grappling hook is actually *quite* useful, compared to previous games where it might have been used 5 times the entire game. The only gripe I have with the combat system is a lack of a cover system. You will run guns blaring into a bunch of enemies and just hope they don't shoot and kill you, because your weapons are like always (weak pistols) and you can't dodge bullets really. The adrenaline system to slow time down will surely save you time and time again.  Remember those button-pressing cutscenes from Legend and Anniversary? Those are now gone, and the game expects you to figure out what the logical move is when the camera slows down for some sort of cutscene like that of predecessors. It works very well, and is quite rewarding when you're unsure of what to do exactly and you get saved at the last second from a jump, grapple, etc.  The sound quality is astounding, as you feel submerged in the game and environment. Granted that I was playing it on a 50"" plasma 1080p HD TV, but nonetheless, the sound and graphics were more than enough to keep me glued to the game for several hours at a time.  The game also gives you the ability to use Lara's PDA to not only assist you with finding where to go, but you can get hints for what to look for, or if you're really stumped, exactly what to do. I encourage you not to use these hints, as they really spoil the beautiful puzzles that have been so carefully crafted by the developers to create a montage of epic proportions.  I'm not really understanding why the game reviewers have lately been so hard on video games. Is it because 'next-gen' is supposed to mean like controlling everything with so much ease and perfection, that all games are getting 7's and 8's.

1813,206803,4,False,"08 17, 2010",A3RTN9YPWMHZ4W,B002S0O76I,HollyGolightly,"The third installment of the Dark Fall games reprises the Dowerton train station and hotel featured in Dark Fall: The Journal.  This time, you are playing as a nameless Inspector who has come to investigate the 2005 disappearance of an 11 year old girl, in the hopes of resolving the mystery that ruined your career.  Compared to the earlier Dark Fall games and especially the mammoth undertaking that is Lost Crown, Lost Souls is streamlined and plays quickly.  Many of the puzzles are logic/common sense rather than inventory-based, so it takes some mental bandwidth.  Several puzzles repeat themselves throughout the game (e.g., picking locks or talking to ghosts) so once you solve the first one, you have something to work from.  The game also requires manipulating objects by zooming in and dragging up/down/left/right, which I found awkward.  A few puzzles are timed--if you happen to die, the game automatically restores you.  Pros: The graphics are excellent--almost as good as Syberia--so if you like (or at least tolerate) the macabre, then there is PLENTY to look at.  I'm not a big fan of the ghost-hunting equipment that Jonathan Boakes likes to use, so I was happy that I didn't have to mess with goggles and ghost-sensors and whatnot.  Best of all, the game flow isn't overly burdened with complexity or a zillion characters to keep track of, so things move along quickly.  Often, solving a puzzle and walking out of the screen is enough to prompt guidance on where to go next from a mysterious character who sends timely SMS messages.  Cons: So if the design is superbly atmospheric, what's the problem? The story--both by itself and in context with the other Darkling games--is pretty illogical.

My kids are younger and had a difficult time with the Wii fit because they weigh so little.  This is much easier for them to use and the games are fun, but the mat is frustrating. It may be easier with older kids (mine are preschool age). The main problem is that you can select items in the navigation with the wii remote, or the mat. Well when a young child finished an exciting game where they are doing a lot of jumping, they continue jumping. So the selection on the menu would change, or the kids would accidentally jump on the '+' on the mat, accepting the choice on the screen.  This also happened during the course of the games. The kids got so excited they couldn't run in place, and would step forward on the controller buttons and pause the game.  Being able to stay on the correct spots is a big issue. The kids look at the screen, not at the floor, so it is very easy for them to move from the correct space, especially in games that require jumping.  There are a few advantages over the Wii Fit (although I still wouldn't trade mine for the world!). This mat works well with smaller children because it registers their weight better. It also allows you to specify if the player is an adult or child. And, it is much easier to go back to the beginning to switch players. And there are many two player games, both competitive and teamwork games. Most Wii Fit games are one player.","Good game, lots of fun, but some drawbacks",1221004800,43.0,,,player age move menu navigation much advantage use remote wii excite specify adult space player world young jumping teamwork child many happen button change big problem pause mine accept good although accidentally fun floor little course one lot issue back child-friendly place answer frustrate able easy child fit item step game register weight time screen switch especially excite would get game also still small work jump young controller easy trade difficult forward kid select buy main preschool require choice spot begin continue two correct finish mat look run allow stay go well weigh may older competitive selection

Titular half vampire, half human heroine Rayne returns in the modern day this time, taking on descendants of her evil father Kagan who are planning to resurrect their master and bring chaos to the world.  With Bloodrayne 2, the story is only secondary as you hack, slash, and splatter tons of foes who all look like they robbed the local Hot Topic.  How you dispatch these enemies is where the real fun of the game is to be had; as different button combinations allow you to perform different, and bloody, kill combos.  Also, there are slight puzzle elements where you must dispatch an enemy using the environment to advance, which is a nice touch as well.  However, the game does get quite repetitive after a while, which isn't much of a surprise, but it really hurts the game's overall rating.  The game looks decent for the most part and the over the top gore is nicely done, while the atrocious dialogue and terrible voice acting grates on the nerves, but has a goofy charm to it nonetheless.  All in all, Bloodrayne 2 is worth checking out for a quick and bloody action fix, and hey, it least it's better than the movie that was adapted from it.","Fun at first, but gets repetitive after a while",1158105600,2.0,,,puzzle local titular slight look perform nice master much person quite goofy return fix button repetitive chaos heroine nicely like topic splatter adapt slash however movie evil rob half take world action hot foe charm least environment get modern allow ton kagan element third different advance real must surprise good combination naturally surprisingly fun really rayne enemy touch part dispatch enemy act bloody subsequently resurrect quick dialogue worth terrible kill first time top hey descendant game also grate decent sequel voice hurt day human check game's release rating gore combo father bring atrocious overall nerve story bloodrayne hack look actioner secondary nonetheless use well do vampire planning busty

Probably the biggest surprise for me is that on the same old system Fallout runs at near maximum quality settings at 1440x900 while Oblivion ran at mid-low settings at 1024x768. I don't know what Bethesda did but it worked!  There are moments where the old Fallout games shine through, enough to make me feel that I am still in that world. Bethesda still has something to learn about black humor but there are glimmers of it in this game. One thing they have nailed is grimness. There are plenty of reminders of the human toll of the apocalypse but it would be nice if they were better balanced with more of the lighter moments.  The graphics are lovely, the sounds are adequate. I enjoy the VATS system and after hours of play find myself spending about 50% of each battle in real time.  Some of the voice acting is really well done, quite a change from the lumpy and wooden work in Oblivion. Fallout suffers from a shortage of dialogue and like Oblivion there are too few actors but the overall quality is superior. I have laughed out loud at some of the flavor dialogue, like being griped at by Jericho when I have left him waiting on his own for a while.  If you like RPGs you will probably like Fallout 3. If you liked Fallout 1 and 2 with some mod-work you will probably like Fallout 3.

This game could be better named: ""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".  Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).  *Wave Hand* ""This is not the game you are looking for... Move along!""  PLEASE, READ ON...  In the beginning... This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.  They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""  We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figured out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...  Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...  They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could ""streamline"" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!  The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?  The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.  As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.  This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.  Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying.

Each area of the ""house"" (there is a kitchen, bedroom and such as they call it) has 5 galaxies some are ""bonus"" type where you get to do just one challenge.

Not that I was against it or anything, I remember playing the first one when it was brand new and it was ok, but I never really got involved in it, and over the years I got into the GTA games and figured whats the point of just racing when GTA offers more and having played breifly the previous Undercover and not being impressed, Well, I was given this game and low and behold... I was hooked in minutes!  Its a simple transition from GTA 5/Online racing to this game. The controls are very much the same and both games seems identical enough to be something where if you enjoy one, you can enjoy the other too. It features a city map that compared to GTA is rather small, but it works for this game and everything is easy to get used to and give you an understanding of how the game works and what you're meant to do.  It features a vast amount of cars, ranging from average everyday ones to super cars to really blow the doors off racers. Bonus points for featuring my favorite, the Lamborghini Countach. Mods and upgrades are easy enough to obtain, but not too easy, they will take practice, and the races do give you a good feel of speed involved. You can take it to the street and work your way through becoming the #1 racer in a top 10 list offline, or join online and compete in various other races against other people. Which surprisingly online still works and has not been shut down so far like many other games that over a year old.  My only gripes with the game is the annoying cops. Sometimes they just come out of nowhere going faster than they should, but it only bothered me in new cars that had not had their ram chasis upgraded yet, so anything that touched me would cause me to crash out, until you make the car stronger.  There are things you can do in the game, but it's mostly just adding up race points to unlock the next pro driver on the top 10 list, or being victorious in races for upgrades. But the thing I like best is that most cars are unlockable from the start. You just need to find them on the map and then they are yours to use whenever you like... none of the grinding races for money to try and afford the good cars.  There is plenty of extra DLC too, but none of it is free, and tho I enjoyed this game a lot, I really don't feel the need to spend the price they ask to unlock an airport area, or another amount of $ to unlock movie cars etc... and the overall price to unlock everything does not seem worth it to me. Maybe if it was 99cents per car you want, I'd consider it, but I guess to each their own when it comes to that stuff.

1854,438971,5,False,"01 5, 2017",A1DX1L3G94DZZ2,B01F9HMO2K,Spi3000,"For the longest time during the millennium, a lot of shooters were heavily focused on one time period, Modern. At first it wasn't a bad thing, in fact it was rather fresh to be playing a War game with weapons that actual armed forces would use today. Unfortunately the Modern Age passes, and eventually Future steps in the ring. EA and Dice did not step into this ring, and stayed with Modern. And fortunately they didn't step into the ring because Futuristic got old fast. And while one company believes that Futuristic is the only way for modern FPS, EA and Dice decide to go smart and go back to the roots by going before its roots. Ladies and Gentlemen, Battelfield 1 is most certainly a game worth buying.  With all the games involving guns going Future, Battlefield steps doesn't even jump on the wagon and instead makes a new one by going Pre-War, World War I to be exact. And thank God they did. While Titanfall 2 is fine as it's an IP that was designed to be futuristic, EA's rival Activision with their Call of Duty Franchise seems to think that because Advanced Warfare was so great, that every single game after should be based on that. And I won't lie that I had fun moments with Black Ops III, but when you have 2 games that essentially copies over from the original game that did features that were introduced in the franchise, it gets sick and tiring. Activision knew this which is why the got Raven Software to bundle Modern Warfare Remastered just to trick and swindle people to get a game they don't want. But that's a whole rant I won't go fully into. Battlefield did the absolute opposite of what Activision did, and by God it was a very good choice. Even though World War games have been done, it's been years since either Call of Duty or Battlefield has even stepped in those waters, as well as many gamers. I'm certain there's World War themed games that were released in the Millennium, but not many with a big name or publisher. Which is why Battlefield 1 being set in World War I is a big deal, it's a name we all know with a new take that hasn't been seen in a long time.  If you played Battlefield before, you'll probably get the hang of Battlefield 1 in a near instant. The gameplay isn't all different from the last two games, which is honestly fine as I've stated multiple times that this game takes place in a different era. But that doesn't mean that everything you learned from Battlefield 4 and Hardline automatically passes down. With different vehicles this time around as well as weapons, you'll have to figure out how some things work best with you. But the best way to get a grip for Battlefield is obviously Campaign. Campaign is kind of different this time around. I say ""Kind Of"" because technically Battlefield has done Story Mode like this in the past, but in terms of the past 10 years, no game comes to my mind at least. So instead of starting from ""Page 1"" you pretty much get a selection of stories. All of which are fairly short, but each story introduces it's own mechanics that you'll essentially need to know when playing online. From Tanks. Planes, Horses, Sentry Kits (Which essentially means you get put in a Knight Armor while wielding a Heavy Machine Gun), and Behemoths (Battle Trains, Airships, Battleships). While essentially training you for Online Play, you also experience stories that actually took place during World War 1, with a little fantasy as the stories are around a hundred years old so they're more likely not going to be completely accurate. But during some of these moments, like the story with the Tank, you sometimes forget you're playing a game. Even though the cutscenes are fairly short, it's almost like seeing an actual scene to a movie. The Plane story has the same feeling as its conclusion makes you second guess if what you did actually happened? The only story I thought felt weak compared to the 5 given in the game has to be the the Sentry Kit. The story starts off kind of revealing its ending. It's also the shortest of the 5 stories with only two levels. But I'm not gonna lie, being in armor with a machine gun is fun so it has moments. Even if you get this game for the Multiplayer, I would recommend trying campaign to see these stories.  Speaking of Multiplayer, let's talk Multiplayer. It's pretty fun. Conquest and Rush are back, as well as Team Death Match. Battlefield 1 also brings in two new game modes, Operations and Pigeon Wars. I've honestly have yet to do Pigeon Wars but am interested on how it's like, but Operations is quite fun. What is Operations? Did you play Battlefront's first free DLC where you played on Jaku? No? Well here's essentially the gameplay. You have one side trying to defend objectives while the opposing side take objectives. If the opposing side takes all objectives, they advance a sector of the map while the defenders retreat. There's two objectives per sector meaning two possibilities the enemy will attack. If a objective is taken, it can be retaken as long as one objective still belongs to the defenders. But if both objectives are taken by the opposing team then that sector is lost. If the Defenders win by eliminating all necessary Attackers, the Attackers will get a Behemoth which depending on the location can be a Battle Train, an Airship, or a Battleship. If the Attackers win all sectors, the map is changed to a different location that the Attackers would / did advance in World War I. That's right, Operations is essentially a Reenactment of battles, and when the game ends, you get a History Lesson of what did happen, and what could of happen depending on who won the game. The game mode has one problem unfortunately. When the game ends, it doesn't cycle maps like other game modes. Yes yes I know what I said regarding when Attackers Win all the sectors, but when the map changes there, technically speaking that's still part of the game the defenders lost from. That lost continues on. So when the game finally ends, it doesn't start a brand new game of Operations. To do a new game, you have to Quit and find a new game, to which could mean you could start at the very end of a game. It happens all the time and it's kind of sad. I like the game mode, but just the fact there's no Cycle with Operations, I'm more than likely to play on Conquest. To which Conquest has slightly changed. It's still the same, grab objectives, shoot opposite team to score points based on objectives your team has. But this time, if a team is ahead on the scoreboard, the opposing team will get a Behemoth. Behemoths won't appear super early, more like when someone hits the 700 point range. This is a good thing as it gives the opposing team a chance to make a desperate needed comeback. And Behemoths don't just take a few hits to destroy, oh no, they take a lot. But like standard vehicles that can have engines and weapons disabled if hit enough times, Behemoths can get disabled to if hit enough times. And if your on the team with the Behemoth, you want ALL those weapons in working order. But because of how large these vehicles are, they're also big target markers. Meaning once it appears, everyone is going to be shooting at it. Which on one hand it's fine as those things have plenty of defense, but Weapons can be disabled in a matter of seconds. There's also times I believe the Behemoth should appear earlier than it should, as there is times when it'll appear but the score just shouts ""No chance for comeback."" That being said, it is a nice balance and a potentially needed comeback that a team may need.  Ending on a final note, I have but one request I hope gets fixed later during Battlefield 1's life, the loading. I don't know if it's me, but I feel Battlefield 1's loading is much longer than Battlefield 4's loading time. And 4 was pretty long at times to a point I sometimes say ""OH C'MON!"" And then it loads to Spawn Menu. With Battlefield 1, it just feels like ""C'mon"" all the time. And I think it's also this loading issue that deters me away from Operations just because of how long the loading is. I'd still wish that the maps cycle, but I'd probably wouldn't care much to have to quit in order to find a new game either. Who knows, it could be just my imagination and the loading is maybe just as long as 4. But I still hope they speed it up later on. Other than this one request, I do recommend Battlefield 4.

1881,204710,5,True,"05 6, 2014",AC80XT00V5JIH,B002I0J8KS,TrueBlue1982,"Since its release, early adopters of the PlayStation Move have been looking for new experiences tailored to mature and core audiences. The Fight: Lights Out is Sony's first real attempt to cater the PS Move towards these markets by providing violent and gritty bare-knuckle boxing action. Is this game a contender? Or is it destined to take a beating?  Starting with a fairly robust character-creation mode, the game immediately follows into a series of unintentionally-hilarious video tutorials hosted by none other than 'Machete himself', actor Danny Trejo. These videos manage to perfectly set the tone for everything else to come -- but not in a good way. From the gritty urban setting to an angry Trejo speaking as if he is passing a kidney stone, the game fails to muster any kind of edginess. It tries to be so tough, but watching Trejo teach you how to fight in an aggressively over-the-top way while waving hot pink and baby blue-lit PS Move controllers, makes it completely impossible to take seriously. The tutorial ends up being much more of a gut-buster than the fighting could ever hope to be. You'll be down for the count, but probably because you're rolling with laughter.  After undertaking a laborious calibration process (which happens before every single fight), Trejo will take you step-by-step through all of the basics you will need to learn in order to handle yourself in a fight. These include moving your fighter, ducking and weaving, blocking and throwing punches. These are all fairly self-explanatory, aside from the need to press buttons for certain actions that really shouldn't need buttons. You'd think that blocking would be as simple as holding your dukes up towards your face, but many times we would lose calibration and would have to hold the O button on the PS Move to calibrate the fighter in the right direction again. This can feel extremely unnatural and it'll take some time to get used to pressing it before you think about throwing your hands up.  Throwing punches seems like something that'd work quite naturally with the PS Move controller. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. No matter how hard and fast you throw your punches, your on-screen counterpart moves with the speed and precision of a blindfolded senior citizen trying to whack a piata. I kept finding that while some of the time my punches would hit their target, I'd also have a frustrating amount of my punches go way off the mark. It also doesn't help that even when your punches do connect, they are weak and ineffectual.  Moving your fighter involves holding down the Move button and tilting one of your Move controllers either to the sides or forward (Trejo's deadly serious demonstration of how this works is sensational). As the game requires you to stand in the same spot for the entirety of the fight, moving around at all will cause the camera to misplace you, making your punches even more inaccurate than they already are. Add to this the fact that most of opponents keep just walking backwards, or other classic fighting tactics, such as constantly walking around you in a circle and you will be spending much of the fight not punching with one hand because you're holding your controller forward in an effort to catch up.",the fight  : light  out is  very awesome,1399334400,,,,count machete punch aggressively dukes over-the-top spot hard move baby much effort connect amount hand action quite none work destine unintentionally-hilarious teach way button extremely counterpart basic violent immediately like order ever fight step-by-step spending blindfold require blue-lit gut-buster could muster add come need fail completely think core action hot fighter time adopter hold box audience press tutorial weave get video controller opponent circle mode character-creation many towards calibrate citizen i'd self-explanatory pink press button market take unnatural seem something make already simple hand serious feel real bare-knuckle direction laughter that'd tailor tilt handle unfortunately naturally fairly actor urban demonstration hope entirety catch host really involve cater one fact manage contender piata face mark series new aside right walk try pass try frustrate hold kidney kind seriously good set single speed experience punch danny perfectly probably video use roll side misplace first target angry beat robust light undertake certain calibration learn early help time find attempt block would deadly senior tactic everything game mature also speak on-screen end weak work duck even sony's hit include controller matter fast else stone keep release it'll sensational forward playstation trejo's move laborious case precision either watch process constantly around since wave set move gritty classic inaccurate follow tutorial fight make impossible happens tough tone go throw edginess ineffectual cause provide throw backwards every start look lose whack keep trejo camera stand

However, once getting underneath the exterior it becomes an absolute grind on the same content over and over. loot tables defective, the fact that PvP is pushed far more than a open world we were promised is disheartening. Don't get me wrong, I been gaming for over 35 years and I can still compete in PvP rather well, however, we were promised a more open-world to forge our Destiny.  None of the content pushed or shown through E3 is in the game. Due to severe sickness I have been confined in the house so I had more hours than most to grind and play this game. Around lvl 25 it all went downhill and by lvl 27 it came to a screeching halt. The promise of open-world exploring, large amounts of solo content, etc. are not there unless you grind the same content over and over in patrols, etc. The end game is the raid and trying to gear up for it is a a chore.  Destiny also toted itself as a revolutionary social experience that is non existent. It lacks communication options for a game focused on co-op play. Heck, I would take WOW's Barrens chat over nothing at all with a mute and ignore option. The Tower and NPC's are static and Destiny toted a living, breathing world. So many fundamentally things wrong with such a beautifully promising game.  I don't think Destiny knows what it wants to be. In terms of an MMO its at the bottom of the free to play pool in terms of quality. As far as an FPS its rock solid. However, trying to implement the two along with melding some other genre's doesn't work well in Destiny.

This game is simply stupendous, in so many ways. Not only is it filled with nostalgia for the DK of my childhood, but it also adds a ton of new ideas that are not only cool for DK, but for 2-D platformers in general. This game is a real treat. Once again, Retro Studios has nailed it, and this game actually soothes some of the sting I felt at learning they were not developing a new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metroid-game/dp/B002ATY7JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metroid game</a>&nbsp;(Not gonna lie, it still hurts a little). If you don't like somewhat longer, detailed reviews, then give this one a pass. You've been warned.  The story in DKCTF is very unique for the series. Once again, Retro has created an all-new villainous force for DK and co. to face called the ""Snowmads,"" a ragtag army of arctic animals with a major Norse/viking theme. They rudely crash DK's birthday party with an invasion, driving all our favorite Kongs away from their home island while also redecorating it to suit their snowy tastes. Needless to say, they brought a polar vortex of their own, transforming DK's island paradise to a frigid arctic playground. Thus, DK and three of his closest companions begin a trek across several unique and totally different islands to take back his home. The premise is cool and all (Like that pun? No...? I'll see myself out...), but like all platformers, the story is there to introduce the platforming action and then take a step back to let the gameplay shine, and it does so well here.  The graphics in DKCTF are, putting it bluntly, drop-dead gorgeous. There's so much vibrant color and imagination in this game, it's fantastic! Because you'll be traveling across several different islands, you'll be treated to a huge variety in locales, all of which look awesome. From DK's frozen island, to an island filled with flaming boars, massive mountain crags, and Viking Owl villages, all in a beautiful autumn, to an island strewn with the wreckage of countless boats, planes, and ships (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samus-starship-cleverly-hidden-in-the-canopy-in-one-level-which-is-awesome/dp/B00006IJJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samus' starship cleverly hidden in the canopy in one level, which is awesome!</a>), to a jungle during harvest time filled with jelly, rivers of juice, and other food items (Yummy), there's no shortage of interesting level themes. Remember the beautiful silhouette levels from DKCR? They return in full-force here, making some levels look like they'd belong in a sweet art house indie game. Lots of creativity in this game visually, you'll never be bored. Seriously people, this game is gorgeous, and it runs at a smooth 60 fps which is awesome. The new enemies are also really neat and full of character. While it's easy to miss the Kremlings, Retro has made up some equally charismatic and iconic villains to replace them, if you ask me. I love the Snowmads. Really, the charm in this game is everywhere. I love how Donkey will sit down and start playing a 3DSXL if left idle. I love the different personalities of the main characters. This game is full of charisma.  The sound design in the game is also fantastic. Lots of nostalgic sound effects return. I also really enjoy the voice actor's work on DK and the rest of the characters, even if it's all relegated to shouts, grunts, howls, etc. Best of all, this game sees the return of David Wise, the brilliant composer behind the original Donkey Kong Country trilogy's incredible music. Remember the unspeakably awesome atmosphere of songs like ""Aquatic Ambiance"" and ""Stickerbrush Symphony?"" This game has songs of that caliber (Both of those in addition to other fan favorites actually show up gloriously remixed, and the latter is evoked in the incredible ""Alpine Incline"").  Remember the bop-your-head-to-the-beat awesomeness of the original ""DK Island Swing"" or the dramatic epicness of ""Flight of the Zinger?"" Yep, that kind of greatness is here too. I would start listing off awesome tracks from the game, but pretty much *every* single song is stellar. No joke. I love David Wise's music so much. He hit it out of the park with this one. Recruiting him was very smart on Retro's part. Thank goodness he agreed to come back to the series. As a matter of fact, I'd go as far as to say the soundtrack is a major, major selling point for this game. If they ever release this game's soundtrack, I WILL buy it immediately. I don't care if I have to import it from Japan, I *need* this game's soundtrack.  The gameplay in Tropical Freeze is, at its core, the same great formula introduced almost two decades ago, with even more of the refinement and freshness that DKCR introduced to the mix. You'll be enjoying a 2-D platformer with a tangible rhythmic quality to it that is very satisfying, with controls so tight you can bounce a quarter off the game and make change. Alongside Rayman's recent outings, you will not find a platformer with such great controls and unique, challenging level designs. You'll be collecting red balloons, banana coins, and literally hundreds upon hundreds of bananas. KONG levels and puzzle pieces are hidden cleverly in the levels. Mine carts return to turn you into a sweat-drenched, adrenaline-drained husk. Make no mistake, this game is ridiculously challenging, perhaps infuriatingly so for some gamers, which is something to keep in mind. DKCTF is a game that hearkens back to a time when dying in the same spot a couple dozen times in a row was due to a lack of player skill, not the game being ""cheap"" (so many games these days coddle gamers, it's nice to see old-school challenge in my opinion). Boss fights are a highlight as well. Most of them have multiple parts, each of which requires you to take a new and different approach. This makes boss fights super hard, but also very engaging and challenging, which I appreciate.  DKCTF also introduces quite a few new ideas to the DKC mix. For the first time since DKC3, DK and friends can swim. In my opinion, the controls in these segments are much better than they were in the old DKC games. Underwater levels in this game are actually awesome thanks to more than just the music this time. There's a lot more emphasis on 2.5-D in this game. During many barrel segments, the camera will change to a full-on 3-D view, which makes for some mind-bending challenge and exciting set-pieces. Even mine cart segments have some 3-Dish moments, which is awesome. The biggest change to the game is the introduction of two new characters. DK and Diddy return and play exactly as they did in DKCR. New to the game are *drumroll* DIXIE KONG, who plays similarly to Diddy but has a double jump of sorts that gives you some extra distance and height. Totally new to the series is CRANKY KONG (He hasn't been the star of a game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/canonically/dp/B00002SVES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">canonically</a>&nbsp;in a loooong while), who essentially uses his cane in true&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DuckTales/dp/B00F9N08WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DuckTales</a>&nbsp;pogo fashion. Cranky's style is particularly unique, and so fun to use. While player-one can only ever play as DK, each of the three supporting characters add really fun and unique benefits to your move-set. All the characters are fun to play, whether DK for player one or the other three for player two, and the increased variety is really nice for people who love co-op gaming like my wife and I do. Overall, there's a lot of new ideas in this game, too many to count here. Suffice it to say, this is a major step forward for the DKC series, and most definitely not a rehash.  Let's face facts, this game rules for the most part, but there are some subjective aspects that some may not like. These should be pointed out for the sake of objectivity. Like I said earlier, this game is ridiculously hard, especially after you get past the first couple islands (and even those can be challenging!). This game will not coddle you. No, this game will kick your @$$ six ways to Sunday, and that will undoubtedly turn some gamers off. As much as I love co-op, you have to be so in tune with your partner to succeed, and the slightest mistake will ruin everything. My wife loves playing DKC with me. For us as a couple, DKCR and now this game have been majorly bonding at the best of times, and end-of-the-world fight inducing at the worst of times (I'm only partially kidding, lol). All I'm saying is the punishing difficulty and co-op don't always mix too well. Also, when playing co-op, they did not make a way for player-2 to quickly switch characters or drop in/out. You have to pause the menu, select the drop out option, then reconnect to pick a new character. That's a major pain. Perhaps worst of all, or least worst of all depending on your opinion, they did nothing to utilize the Wii-U's features in any meaningful way.  Don't expect any interesting implementation of the touch screen, gyroscope, etc. The gamepad's screen isn't even on if you select to play off of the T.V, in fact. Rather than a Wii-U showpiece, this is just an awesome traditional hardcore DK experience that happens to be exclusive to the Wii-U, which I'm perfectly happy with. Focusing on the core experience in development is always better, I say  I don't know how Retro does it, but every game they make is just pure gold. They must employ Midas or something. I've played for many hours by now, solo and with my wife, have reached several islands, conquered several bosses, and I'm really thinking that this is the best Donkey Kong game I've ever played. I'm not just blowing smoke or using hyperbole. This game is just pure, refined 2-D platforming gold, and I absolutely love it. DKCTF makes DKCR look like an extended demo in comparison, and I LOVE DKCR, so that really is a testament to the greatness of Retro's work on Tropical Freeze.

1893,107732,5,False,"02 24, 2009",A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000QY9C90,Gradient Vector Field,"Let me preface this review by saying this game is amazing!  Before playing this I was already reasonably sure I would like this game.  It uses the same engine Half Life 2 does and I really like the mechanics in that game.  This game is a first person shooter co-op capable game.  It's sort of like having a dream come true.  I really wish there was a Half Life 2 split screen co-op capability, but Left 4 Dead is a great supplement for that.  On some levels I find this game a curious liking for me.  I'm usually a very story oriented player, meaning that if there is no story line I tend to not be as interested.  Even if the story line sucks, at least its there and I usually wind up wanting to find out what happens at least a little bit.  Left 4 Dead isn't setup that way.  It really is one of the ultimate zombie survival games.  (Okay, I admit, I haven't really played that many in my day...)  It essentially has no real background story; you are merely thrust into a situation where you need to run to survive.  No explanation on who you're with or who they are, you just want to get out.  This sounds pretty on point to me.  Despite these seemingly obvious downsides, I barely noticed them.  I still thought this was a great game.  My friend and I sat down to play this game a few weeks ago.  I was disappointed to see that there were only four missions we could play through.  I thought I would find this game mediocre at that point.  This completely blew away those expectations!  Basically you play one of the four survivor characters.  There are four different scenarios with the same basic theme.  You are in one location and the extraction point is someplace else.  The only way for you to get rescued is to travel through the area until you get to the extraction point.  This is usually pretty far away and can take over an hour of game play to reach.  There are safe houses in between to break up the level and so you can resupply with ammo and health packs.  On your way you have to battle through literally hordes of zombies!  Despite the four scenarios having essential the same theme, the environments are pretty different, so I never felt like I was being fed the same thing over and over, even though I technically was.  I was far more concerned with accomplishing the goal!  Seriously, this game is so much fun that we've played it several times already.  Usually I don't care much about the achievements on the games, but this game has us trying to actually unlock these achievements!  I'm honestly surprised at how much replay value this game has with only four missions of a similar design theme.  The minor complaints I have are really tiny.  I wish it had more weapon options.  Don't get me wrong, the weapons that are available are incredibly useful and fun to use... but part of me wants more.  In most FPS games I have a whole slew of weapons at my disposal.  I think this game would be really cool with more varied weapons.  The only other thing that I didn't like is that you can't run through the campaign as a zombie in offline co-op.  If you really like zombie survival scenarios then this is absolutely a must have game.  If you just like FPS co-op games then this is still a must have game.  The game is an intense run to rescue and you will feel on the edge of your seat most of the time while playing this.  Maybe with the success of this game it will prompt the developer to actually write a more story oriented type of game.  I know this was predominantly made for the Online crowd, but there is a huge interest (as far as I can tell) for adding in a full on campaign to play through.  That would only sweeten the deal.  My one concern would be that this developer would get too focused on online play and remove the basic campaign mode... hopefully they'll never do that (*cough* like Quake Arena... *cough*).

I also followed a guide from the game forums on how to remove the detents and make it a nice, smooth motion from 0 to 100% throttle, which will void your warranty but is totally worth it for Elite: Dangerous. It's also reversible, so it's not a huge deal.  Controlling the game has been much easier since I purchased this stick, and I honestly have no complaints except for driver issues. I got the drivers from the website and they work fine as long as my PC doesn't go to sleep. When my PC goes to sleep and I wake it up, the lights don't come back on until I adjust the LED brightness in the control panel.

Also, while not an Amazon verified purchase, I can assure you, I bought this from Amazon. I ended up buying it on a family member's account while they still had their prime trial,  so I could get the discount and fast shipping.  Return to PopoloCrois  A Story of Seasons Fairytale is a gorgeous little casual fairytale RPG game. Mainly its a PoploCrois game, which weve only seen, at least here in North America, one time prior to the new 3DS entry. Now that game, simply titled PoploCrois was a PSP game which I unfortunately haven't had the opportunity to play. Thankfully, there is no knowledge needed to jump in at Return to PoploCrois.  In Japan, PoploCrois has been going since the late 70s when it originated as a manga created by Yohsuke Tamori. XSEED has translated a portion of this manga into English, and released it on the official Return to PoploCrois site. Never before has it been available to read in English. Japan also got many other PoploCrois games on Sony game systems which weve never seen in North America.   Now the Story of Seasons side of the game, mainly refers to the optional farming aspect. Its not a huge part of the game. Mostly its just a fun little optional sidequest thing which is great for profit making. I definitely think its worth enjoying and making use of. The farming works in real time, so you stop by your farm to plant and raise animals, then go back to enjoying the story. When there is produce ready for you, or animal products I assume too(have yet to get any animals myself), you get a notification at the top of your screen letting you know. In addition to the farming, there are a handful of girls throughout the game who you can grow your relationship with. Visiting them once in a while and giving them gifts, such as crops youve grown, will eventually raise their friendship level over time just like in a Story of Seasons game. You don't marry in this game or have any kids though. Pietro, the main character, is only 13 years old and is already interested in Narcia the witch princess who hes known from before in past PoploCrois stories, originally having met her in the manga. Shes not the only past character to return to this game either, many of Pietros friends and family from the manga show up in Return to PoploCrois. Although again, no knowledge of past PoploCrois media is necessary to enjoy the game.  Gameplay wise Return to PoploCrois plays like a traditional turn based RPG. It has a slight tactics like feel in battle with how you move towards the enemies in a specific range of area you have. If you move within range of reaching an enemy for an attack, then you can choose to do a regular attack. Also is the option before moving to instead, use a magic skill. Each of the various magic skills have their own attack ranges. Lastly are the item and run from battle options which are pretty straightforward.  Outside of battle you can use either the circle pad or the dpad to run around wherever you're going.  Actually, the running around controls are my one gripe with this game. They feel really stiff and directional, not as free moving as say, a game like Fantasy Life or Rune Factory.  It feels like you're always sorta running stiffly and easily slipping back into a walk if you're using the circle pad, but not pushing it all the way over. I definitely wouldnt say its a reason to not get the game though, just the only gripe Ive got so far.  Finally, my thoughts on the graphics and music in Return to PoploCrois. This game is absolutely wonderful in those aspects. The graphics are great, you even get the option of having border outlines around your characters or not. I personally really like the border lines, all the characters stand out better. Its your choice what you want to use. And the cut scenes in this game are gorgeous. They remind me a lot of the cut scenes in Fantasy Life. Theyre really beautiful, and amazing to watch in 3D. I play most of the game without the 3D feature, until I get to a cut scene that is, I always like to switch it on for those. On the music and sound side of things, its equally wonderful and actually really charming. Personally, Im not a big fan of the English voices, I kinda feel like they're sorta cheesier and aren't a very charming aspect in this otherwise really charming game. Thankfully, you have the option of two different Japanese voice styles in addition to the English option. I believe only Narcia and Pietro have different voices for each Japanese option, the rest are supposed to be the same. I myself am currently using the Japanese 1 option.  The Japanese voices make Return to PoploCrois really loveable. I feel like they were meant to be. Not only are the Japanese voices wonderful, but the music in this game is amazing. Never did I expect to hear such wonderful music in a Marvelous game. Not that other Marvelous games have bad music,  I just don't feel like they have nearly as great and varied music as this game. The opening cut scene before the games title screen is wonderful, and every other tune within the game give it a lovely atmosphere, so you can get sucked right into the world of PoploCrois and Galariland.  All in all, I find Return to PoploCrois A Story of Seasons Fairytale, to be a fun, enjoyable and extremely charming game. I feel like anyone who enjoys RPGs, Fantasy Life, or even Rune Factory, will have a great time with PoploCrois and its definitely worth buying. This is only my first impressions review, if I feel theres anything else to add Ill most likely edit in an update section. But as of now, this is one underrated game you should for sure go buy and have fun with.  Pros: -Amazing music -Beautiful art and graphics -Interesting characters -Charming voices with the option of either Japanese or English -A so far very fun story  Cons: -The running around controls with both the circle pad and dpad, felt kinda wonky and somewhat stiff.","An Extremly Charming & Beautiful Game, My First Impressions Review",1456876800,10.0,,,product japanese narcia notification popolocrois traditional actually directional walk marvelous get too(have many thing expect open buying sure make different kinda gripe weve stop ive discount factory range read fun im really enemy part turn control right attack cut far charm believe end ready screen rune japan sidequest hear wise bad official casual work finally jump easily sound relationship release main either fantasy prior run two meant gameplay without entry slip return go site push animal note they're border every trial portion review know knowledge give move yohsuke enjoy character enjoy pad sorta like thought pietros farm graphic level section could character princess america handful visit title enjoyable reach within definitely wherever well unfortunately friends see underrated one grow personally new title girl account option likely english translate worth gorgeous profit first amazon line time range tactic various top give originated buy game also felt dpad still poplocrois supposed voice remind year verify story side scene galariland choose choice create since yet story old stiffly though run xseed originally use loveable always style manga ship slight cheesier tune play magic use friendship farm extremely hour simply know optional opportunity think sony youve straightforward area crop least plant aspect circle pro anyone system eventually voice big equally although music interest huge scene play nearly little thing meet lot psp back regular beautiful enemy pietro free animal let varied marry game watch purchase get suck mostly hes produce impression mainly outline fast art kid buy make assure move ill member's life specific throughout wonderful stiff tamori assume gift say wouldnt theyre stand fairytale option lovely find somewhat raise way refers feature add rpgs world towards con addition great feel already amaze feel real interested shes lastly enjoy grow play medium need atmosphere currently reason go outside otherwise prime update want skill switch there item fan season even necessary battle wonky rest else witch aspect edit north skill rpg never get around instead available past base thankfully show late anything family absolutely pretty

1937,23234,1,False,"08 5, 2006",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005CDR8,Bryan,"The Saturn was a briefly popular 32-bit video game system created by Sega in the 90's.  It was designed to compete with the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64.  Unfortunately for Sega, the Saturn ranks a distant third in terms of enjoyment value.  Looking back, I'd say the Sega Saturn really isn't that bad a system.  I used to play it with my friend and I'd say I had a *little* fun.  It's just that Sony was pumping out an *unbelievable* amount of excellent games during the EXACT time Sega was trying to market the Saturn and, as you know, Sony came out of nowhere and grabbed the attention of millions and millions of video game fans.  This made it VERY hard for Sega to keep up with the surprising success of the Playstation.  Sony wasn't fooling around back then- they were on a mission to dominate the video game market and BOY did they ever succeed.  It permanently changed the video game scene; destroying the console wars between Nintendo and Sega.  Sony coming out of nowhere and almost *immediately* ruling the market pretty much spelled the end of Nintendo and Sega being the only two video game companies competing with each other.  Now a THIRD company entered the mix.  To put it another way- Sony temporarily brought Nintendo to its knees and, in the process, knocked out Sega forever.  Sega was never able to recover from the damage Sony had done.  Everyone thought Nintendo would be the company to destroy Sega.  Nope!  Nintendo came close a few times, though.  With Sega's well-known history of bad marketing techniques, this might have been for the best.  I bet Sega would have continued to struggle if they had made the decision to keep themselves in the console-releasing market after the Dreamcast was finished.  I bet Sega would be looking pretty ugly right now, in terms of sales.  Good thing they pulled away.  Because the Sega Saturn didn't have a long life, the few people out there who actually own one HAVE to notice its main weak point- not very many games to choose from.  The good Saturn games you CAN choose from are either really rare and expensive, or import games never released in America. That's the biggest problem with the Saturn.  Just not enough.  To give Sega credit, the Saturn DOES have some quality games such as Virtua Fighter 2, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Shining Force III, Sonic Jam, Nights and Dracula X.  BUT- and here's the important thing I want you to remember- it would be IMPOSSIBLE to ignore the many crappy games released for the Saturn.  Worthless games such as Corpse Killer, Bug Too!, Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga, Hi-Octane, G-Vector and The House of the Dead don't exactly show off the Saturn's amazing capabilities.  Also keep in mind that the Sega Saturn was an *extremely* awful system when it came to sports games.  Just about every basketball and hockey game released for the system isn't worth a darn.  To me that's surprising when you consider the Sega Genesis was known at one point as the best video game system for sports games.  You'd think Sega would have continued the trend of releasing quality sports games for the Saturn, but they didn't.  Another disappointment.  Everyone likes to point out that the Playstation is the video game system with the highest amount of crappy games.  That's only because Sega gave up halfway through the competition with the Playstation.  Argue with me if you must, but the Saturn was basically dead by the end of 1997.  The Playstation was just getting warmed up by that point.  If the Saturn had continued to compete with the Playstation until say, the year 2000, the Saturn probably would've ended up with JUST as many horrible games.  Sega gave up in 1997 when it finally dawned on them that Sony was putting them out of business.  Mostly jealous Sega fanboys like to point out the high amount of terrible Playstation games, while Playstation fans correctly understand that you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the GOOD games- and believe me, the Playstation had a LOT of good games.  In fact, the best Playstation games are better than the best Saturn games, in my opinion.  Give me Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2 over Nights and Shining Force III ANY day.  It's a shame Sega fans will never stop defending the Saturn with the same old argument.  Time to give it a rest.  In case you haven't noticed already, it bothers me that Sega fans don't seem to mind all the junk that was released for the Saturn and instead point out all the crappy games available for the Playstation.  That's like saying the mosquitos in Miami aren't NEARLY as bad as the ones in Tampa Bay.  Doesn't make much sense does it?  So why am I defending the Playstation's crappy games?  Because I find it a little bit inaccurate (and rude, to be honest) that Sega fans completely ignore the crappy games available for the Saturn and instead focus on the crappy games for the Playstation 1.  I just want to point out that yes, the Saturn DOES have its share of horrible games as well, despite what Sega fans would like you to believe.  I think Sega fans are confused when they say overall, Saturn games feature less loading times than the Playstation.  For a supposedly powerful video game system, you sure had to wait a LONG time to play a game on the Saturn.  For example, you have to sit there for an eternity to play games like WWF: Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game and Mortal Kombat Trilogy.  Compare those loading times to the same games on the Playstation, and the wait isn't NEARLY as inconvenient.  What makes the lengthy loading times on the Sega Saturn even MORE frustrating is how, right after the ""now loading"" screen goes away, the screen turns black for a few seconds making you wait even LONGER.  There's no 3-seconds of blackness on the Playstation.  The *very* second the loading screen goes away on ANY Playstation game, the actual game comes in.  Sega fans like to pretend those few additional seconds of loading aren't happening.  Trust me Sega fans, I DO notice them.  I DO realize that I'm waiting 3 extra unnecessary seconds to play the darn game.  The Saturn is MUCH worse when it comes to loading times.  It's SO slow.  None of this matters anyway, because by the end of 1997 loading times were almost completely gone anyway!  If only the Saturn had survived long enough to see that.  Besides the loading problem, most of the time the Playstation had the superior version when the same game was released for both systems.  This was because the graphics were always clean and sparkly on the Playstation.  On the Saturn, after they finished creating a game it was like they rubbed the graphic engine in the dirt.  Either that, or the person who put the colors in all the Saturn games could only see in black and white.  All the bland, colorless backgrounds on most Saturn games make me feel like I'm digging a hole to China.  Poor, severely-dated graphics.  For a good example, compare the two versions of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  Once again, the Playstation version smears it.  The Saturn version features ugly, grainy and ugly-colored graphics.  If a game appears on both the Saturn and Playstation, compare the graphics and I guarantee the Playstation version will look better.  I can think of only one thing the Saturn did better than Sony- the CD Player built into the system is actually more interesting on the Saturn.  On the Playstation it's just a boring, predictable layout of hitting ""Play"" ""Pause"" ""Forward"" etc.  On the Saturn you have a LOT more options, and the neat-looking background showing a countless amount of shooting stars is pretty impressive to watch while you sit back and listen to the music from the CD you put on.  None of this means the actual quality of the CD player on the Saturn is better- just that the outer space background and addition of more options makes it LOOK better.  They both play CD's very well.  It's a shame the Saturn couldn't hang with the big boys.  It couldn't hang around long enough to see sequels to many popular games such as Resident Evil, Mega Man and Tomb Raider.  All those sequels went to the Playstation and turned out to be VERY successful.  If a game like Resident Evil 2 had appeared on the Saturn, who knows how successful it would have been.  Sony seriously put a hurtin' on Sega.  Funny how the Playstation's gray-colored ordinary-looking system design is actually more attractive than the Saturn's silky-black ""cool"" color.  What's that expression?  Never judge a book by its cover.  Right!

Mario is kidnapped and his friends and its up to peach to save mario so in this game as you can see you play as peach. Let me tell you a lil bit of this game. First off peach has interesting powers unlike mario has. Her powers rely on her emotions so the 4 emotions u can choose are: angry, sad, joy, and calm. Angry is when peach bursts up in fire with rage and u can use to burn down bridges or icy stuff like snowmen. Crying is when peach is sad and can make things grow with her tears. Joy is when peach flys up in the hair and can make a tornato. Calm is when peach can heal herself up slowely use this when peach is low on hp. Also when u use her emotions u use your stylus on the touch screen and click on one of her emotions. When u run out of the points u can recharge by either using peachs umbrella to pick up a creature and crouching down to absorbe it to get the points or by finding one of those blue chrystal type of things which will recharge it as well. There are things you can find in the game like puzzle peices and minigames that you can unlock. There is a shop that you can buy stuff like a better umbrella which is quite helpful to buy in the game and can be stronger in battle for peach. Each chapter in the game at the end u fight the boss. each time u go to the next lvl u hav to find 3 toads so don't forget to find them as well.

Shenmue II not only out does the first one in every way but surprasses it even more, this game is unbelievable.  It is handsdown, my favorite Xbox game ever...EVER.  The story continues with Ryu Hazuki on the journey to find his fathers murderer and to meet a man who may know alot of things about his father then he'd imagine.  Now the game takes place in Hong Kong, and Ryu is still on the hunt....get ready because not only are playing one of the best sequals to a game ever..but you'll be having one of the greatest video game experiences....ever..  Shenmues Graphics are just amazing, As you've already notice I'm not going to give it a negative on visuals since it's not fair because this is a DIRECT PORT from Dreamcast....Those idiots like IGN and gamemagazines should of known this is a direct port and that the visuals were going to be bumped up, hell it would take poor suzukie EVEN MORE YEARS to make the visuals amazing....but who cares cause this game is still AMAZING.  The sound/music is just as beautiful as the original Shenmue, sometimes I'd just stand at one area and listen to the music..it's just so brilliant..  The level desighn for Hong Kong/Kowloo is just incredible, especially one the final chapter of the game, which I won't spoil.  Something I like Shenmue II more then Shenmue I is that Shenmue II is just one of those flat out ""Sequals that didn't fail one bit"" as I can see alot of people love this game but are dissapointed compared to the original...I'm not one bit, Something that Shenmue I had that made me fall in love with the game was the FREE BATTLES and QTE'S....Theres even WAY MORE of those in Shenmue II, and they've never looked so good on the Xbox.  Other then the sequal having more action then it's predecessor, something that I loved about Shenmue is that it got you all pumped up all the way to the grand finale...THIS DOESN'T FAIL AT ALL.  Especially the Yellow Head Building part, which is by far one of the greatest moments in Video game history..  Everything about Shenmue II on Xbox is amazing....It's just so Brilliant!!!!!  Now for anyone who hated Shenmues Slow paced gameplay DO NOT GET THIS GAME, Shenmue II is just the same(but a lil better) as it's predecessor.  It will take awhile to get to the action....More like when you're at the end of the first chapter which by the far longest in this game..  Did I mention this has a very good Length..If you skip all the sidequests and just beat the story for the first thenmue, it would take about maybe...10 to 14 hours...It took me about 13 hours and 45 minutes.. Shenmue II takes about 20 to 30 hours of just playing the story mode of it and skipping some side quests....It's just bigger, better and longer...  The Good  -Superb Visuals and got a bit bumped up on the Xbox  -longer then the original  -the voice acting got a tad bit better but not by much  -Theres more character development and we finally know what SHENMUE means!!  -An amazing scenarion that has to do with the Yellow Head Building and LAN DI!!  -More FREE BATTLES and QTE'S  -More clues to find and people to ask, for me it was fun  -The Music is beautiful  -IT'S Just better then the original...that's all I can say about that....  The Bad  -The controls are TERRIBLE, I had to adjust em' before playing the game  -It got a lot of bad review on lots of sites about it's visuals...they should have known it's a straight port from the Dreamcast  -Just like the Dreamcast...Poor Sales for Shenmue II means NO Shenmue III in the future  -Some like myself were left wanting more after Shenmue II's Ending...amazing though..  Shenmue II on the Xbox is one of the best games ever made, and one of the most overlooked xbox title ever..period..  Just like every other Sega Game on Xbox...  Please if you liked the original you will LOVE Shenmue II, it's just better, longer, better looking, more action, MORE EVERYTHING!!  Why the perfect score?..Because on like most of the idiots who gave it abad score cause of Visuals, I'm being mature about it, so what if it's a direct port from DC, The visuals are still amazing even if it's no Doom 3 or Ninja Gaiden....Other then that, Shenmue II is just a beautiful game and that is why I give it a.......  5 out of 5 stars...

The main feature of this is dogfight mode which basically turns the game into a rail style shooter. When in dogfight mode the game flys for you while you try to get a lock on the aircraft you're trying to shoot down. Most enemy aces are hard if not impossible to kill without using dogfight mode meaning if you don't care for the feature or don't wish to use it this is probably not for you. The game also has added in Call of Duty Style AC-130 missions where the game pilots you around and you give fire support to ground teams and helicopter missions that vary between rail shooters to more traditional free roams. Missions and story are a bit bland compared to the story and characters of previous Ace Combat games but its still a solid game. If you're looking for a traditional Ace Combat game this is one to skip in my opinion.

Nevertheless, the guilty pleasures from the arcades always find a unique way of creeping into some great games, especially from pinball. That has been the case with Nintendo during the past year. For Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, they really hit it big with the success of Mario Pinball Land. It just really brought to life the adventure pinball franchises again. That has also been the case recently with Nintendo's DS system. They had to find a great way to conjure that pinball action again, and it is right here from the brinks of Samus.  Metroid Prime Pinball for the Nintendo DS brings out all the action of the Metroid series, and the uniqueness of pinball. The game offers all sorts of great action with unique different tables that range from traditional, to battle-style matches. The graphics in the game are truly remarkable, and absolutely bring out some of the most remakrable gameplay for a video pinball game ever. The controls for the game also are very simple and easy to operate. While there happens to be little to nothing with the stylus attachment that can be of use here, it doesn't change the fun. The game also makes full use of the Nintendo DS rumble pak, which is also featured as a attachment with the game, by bringing all the action with each motion of the bumpers.  While you sometimes lose some motions when you lose sight of the Samus ball, especially for when it turns back into Samus, especially for the boss battle tables. Although it is on some, but not all the tables, it can be a bit of a hinderence.  Nevertheless, many times when it comes to video pinball games, Metroid Prime Pinball for the Nintendo DS is a great buy, and a must have for anyone who is into the need for a classic case of pinball mania.

(Unless you are an angry gamer)  Like From Software's Dark Souls and Demon's Souls games... Bloodborne will test your mettle by killing you over and over and over. That is until you learn the monsters, areas and bosses in order to triumph. The action is similar to the Souls games. And if you're unfamiliar with those... A. SHAME ON YOU. B. Prepare to dungeon crawl, fight incredibly difficult bosses, and die... A LOT! You'll get a main weapon and a gun in which to perform a type of parry with and have a ranged attack at your disposal. The limited weapon selection is a nice change of pace from Software's other games and allows you to play with the weapon you are most comfortable with. (Kind of like Monster Hunter games) You'll be able to do some customization to your weapon of choice through the use of socketed gems, which in turn can change stats or add elemental attributes to your weapon. The only downside and Achielles heel was the lack of shield. Since I played the Souls Games in a very tanky, slow and steady, nothing should break my defenses manner... it was a slap in the face trying to adjust to the more acrobatic, split second dodge maneuvers that Bloodborne requires. YMMV. The visuals and details in this game is astounding. It was my first game for the PS4 and I am deeply impressed with the capabilities that the PS4 has based on play Bloodborne. Nothing more satisfying that running around, smoting townsfolk of Yarhnam with my kirkhammer and getting completely blood soaked until I myself die. The sound is stellar and the sound track is even better. (It is available for purchase from the PS store too!) The story will leave you scratching your head. But it's more about the action and exploration than really uncovering any meaningful story. And of course there is the NewGame+ feature which will bring some replay value to your $60 purchase.

Rock Band is my first foray into the world of virtual rock stardom.  The Good: This is one of the most fiendishly addictive games I've ever played. My ""band"" had a case of just-one-more-song syndrome that kept us up till 4 am the day we unpacked this. The song list is impressive, with classics like ""Paranoid"" to appeal to dinosaurs like me through brand new hits like ""Here it Goes Again"" for the younger set. New songs are already available to download at the Playstation Store and more content is promised. The tutorials walk you through all the game mechanics, so even though I'd never played any prior guitar games I was able to jump right in. The drum kit is amazing, great fun to play and sturdy enough to withstand use by an adult. I've read in several places that if you can run the drums on expert difficulty you can essentially play the drums for real, and I have no problem believing that. Avatar customization adds another little fun element to it.  The Bad: With the wide range of songs it's almost guaranteed that there's going to be something in there you don't like, and as far as I can tell there's no way to skip songs in career mode. In solo mode I'd like to be able to customize the look of my whole band, instead of just my own avatar, and keep a consistent lineup.  The Ugly: You've read it before and I'm telling you it's true... the guitar controller sucks. It's not very solid, the buttons are kind of mushy, the strummer misses notes now and then and the lower-fret controls are useless for any but the smallest hands. (UPDATE: after four days of use the strummer gave out completely and I had to request a replacement from EA) Also, since the game only ships with one guitar the only way to put a full band together (vocals, drums, lead and bass) is to have a friend who's also bought the game come over and bring his axe along. Fortunately, with all the frustrated internet chatter about this issue I'm sure that some 3rd party controllers will be available before too long, or perhaps an improved Sony model. As it is now the guitar is the only thing standing between this game and a five star rating from me.  Overall: for anyone who loves to air-guitar but lacks the time (or talent) to learn the real thing this game is awesome. The price is steep but worth it.

2008,115959,5,False,"05 22, 2009",A1ILEVGCZXRTC7,B000UU3SVI,M. DiSpirito,"Fallout 3 is absolutely, undeniably, the best first-person RPG I've played to date.  I'll try and break down some reasons why in the following review.  For starters, I'm a game freak: tabletop miniatures, pen-and-paper RPGs, computer games, and console games... I try to give every type of game a chance, but some just don't cut it...  GRAPHICS, SOUND, ETC: There's really nothing to say about it... It's breathtaking, scary at times, and full of ""Wow"" moments.  The graphics on the 360 version are mouth-watering, eye-popping amazing.  The sound is engrossing.  I should mention that I run the game at 1080i via HDMI and hooked up to 5.1 surround.  I've tried it at 720p with just my TV stereo sound and I was no less impressed.  STORY/THEME: post world war 3; actually, 200 years post world war 3.  You can learn all about the history of this alternate timeline in the game; it is fascinating and creepy.  The story is compelling enough to want to play and play (more than you should), but it is not lead-you-by-the-nose.  Like all true Bethesda RPGs, Fallout lets you make the story.  You can choose which missions to do, or you can choose to just wander around like a freaked out, radiation-infected lunatic.  GAMEPLAY: Bethesda improved the game management and interface of Fallout.  I loved Morrowind and Oblivion (Bethesda's previous, fantasy-themed RPGs), but the interface was a bit clunky in those games.  Fallout fixes all the problems, in my opinion, and makes dealing with inventory and stats a breeze.  You'll spend more time sucked into the game world and story then managing your extensive list of weapons, items, etc...  VALUE: the game is pricey--as all newer games are--but I would pay $50 for this game because of two thing: (1) this game could be played many, many times through the original story alone; it is unlikely anyone will find every single hidden place, character, or side mission in one pass.  (2) Bethesda has already released relatively inexpensive add-ons that greatly improve the game; a couple of the expansions are almost entirely new games in and of themselves!  CONTENT: This game is not--NOT--for kids.  Take the Mature rating very seriously.  There is plenty of foul language, drug use, and sexually suggestive material.  The game is rated for and intended for adults.  Please do not let kids play this game.  I only turn this bad boy on when my kids are in bed for the night--period.  EDIT (UPDATED 11/5/10): I can't say enough about this game; 5 stars isn't high enough, let's put it that way.  I've finished all five DLC packs and would gladly pay for 5 more.  160+ hours later and I still love playing this game.  Whether I'm just exploring the wasteland or re-playing the main story with a new character, Fallout never seems to get old.  This is the first game ever that I kept--didn't trade in or give to a buddy.  I've been gaming for 20 years, so that should say something about how awesome this game is!  After trying Fallout: New Vegas, this game is still the best; there's no comparison.  Grab the Game of the Year edition and you'll be occupied for a LONG time.",Whoa...

2010,194398,4,True,"03 20, 2010",A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B002BRWUA8,Tempting Reviews,"For summary judgment, skip to the very bottom.  I'll never understand Sega's game release date logic.  They often release some simply outstanding games (Skies of Arcadia, Valkyria Chronicles, Sonic Adventure, NiGHTS on Sega Saturn, Shining Force, and now this), but when they release them, it's amidst larger, more notable games, and as a result the Sega games get kicked to the curb.  In particular they did that with Valkyria Chronicles - it was released, surrounded by two of the largest games at the time, Call of Duty: World at War and Gears of War 2.  It never stood a chance.  Nevermind the fact that Sega never even bothered to advertise Valkyria Chronicles in GameStop or Amazon or any other game store.  I only knew about it because I specifically target RPGs.  We've got people who are just now playing the game, realizing that they skipped over a classic.  Resonance of Fate is/will be such a game too.  Overshadowed by the hype that is Final Fantasy XIII and God of War 3, I fear that this one will go under the radar and not get played for two years like its brother.  If you're reading this review, hopefully you're at least curious, or maybe you just weren't impressed by Final Fantasy XIII.  I suppose it's possible you already beat that game and moved on.  In either case, this review is going to be a bit difficult to follow, because I have to exert extra effort into how to express what I think about this game.  Not bad, just...different.  RoF takes place in the distant future, where humanity has so destroyed the world that the majority of the population is gone and dead.  Before their end they created a large machine, called Basel, that is designed to purify and replenish the earth.  It was not able to do this, as the remaining population decided just to live on some of the levels of Basel and ended up ruining it.  It's livable, but not able to do what it's designed to do.  The story unravels slowly as you are introduced to the various characters of the game.  Unlike other RPGs, there is no ""meeting"" your party.  You start with all three of the characters you'll be using, and though one or two may leave or be otherwise not available at times, generally you're working with the three.  There's a reason for this - the battle engine, which I'll get to later, works best when you have a full staff.  IT's not for nothing though: there's something to be said about a game that actually shows its male characters watching porn while the female character is taking a shower...then cracks jokes about the size of said female character's breasts (no, there is no nudity displayed!)  The graphics in RoF remind me a lot of Infinite Undiscovery, Star Ocean: The Last Hope or Magna Carta 2 - where everything looks like the screen is at maximum contrast and sharpness and things just ""pop"" at you.  This can be good or bad - it's an acquired taste and certainly not nearly as visually stunning as Final Fantasy XIII, but it's not a horrible looking game, either.  In fact some of the towns and buildings you'll visit are quite detailed, down to things moving in the background and the changing from day to night (something very few RPGs do anymore, by the by) as you adventure.  There are a given number of game engine cutscenes, and a select few CGI full motion ones.  What is there, is fairly short and not designed to be the focal point of the game by any means.  The cutscenes last barely a minute each, and are snippets of the overall story.  The majority of it is told through the quests and the dialogue between the characters, so if you're not a fan of reading, you might want to skip this game.  Don't expect to see the usual swords and spears of other games.  RoF uses guns and other artillery to get the job done.  These guns can be customized with different parts to make your characters as powerful as you want them to be.  Your weapons also have levels of their own besides the characters' levels.  As you level up, you gain various skills and enhancements that make your characters more potent in battle...and trust me, you'll need them.  Some battles are extremely simple, but you get to bosses that use certain strategies that will push your skills to the limit.  In regular battles there are times you seem invincible; some bosses can bring you to your knees with a few shots.  It's that random.  You can run and shoot in given directions, jump and shoot your enemy into the ground, or juggle your enemy into the air from below.  There are a variety of other techniques that you can leverage to assist you, all of which require a lot of multitasking to do.  It's not the type of game you can button mash your way through - maybe a few of the regular enemies, definitely not the bosses.  For example, you might run, but be stopped by a boss who levels you with a major attack.  Depending on how much damage you'd taken up to that point, you might be sent into critical mode, which makes you so weak that all you can do is shoot and run away; no fancy tricks.  One more hit, you're dead, and have to try all over again.  Without going into too much detail about the battle engine, know that it feels like a mish-mash of a number of games from the past: Max Payne, for the acrobatic gunslinging; Wild ARMs, just because; and a pinch of Dark Cloud, in that the enemies you defeat hold the key to ""rebuilding"" the world around you.  As you slay each enemy, you'll gain energy hexes that are used to navigate the world.  This naturally forces you to do battle in order to advance in the game, and discourages you from running from every enemy.  You really shouldn't be about running anyway...because you'll come up against a boss that will mop the floor with you in short order if you don't keep your party sufficiently powered up. If you're feeling adventurous, RoF features a number of difficulty levels that you can unlock as you beat the game, each one incrementally more challenging than the ones before it, with the base level being difficult enough as to frustrate most reviewers.  If you're a glutton for punishment, the game will give you what you came for.  However, I want to warn you: The battle controls are a bit difficult to learn.  There are so many controls that make use of basically every single button that they can be overwhelming.  There is a full on training section; use it.  DO NOT try to just jump into the game and start playing without going to the training, because you will get killed and you will get confused, I promise you!!!  Resonance of Fate is a throwback to older games such as Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man and the NES versions of Metal Gear, where you'll encounter bosses that are so cheap that you feel compelled to defeat them no matter the cost.  To the game's credit, it never feels like you're underpowered or underleveled, because you were forced to grind to unlock the energy hexes.  But it's the tactics used by the bosses that will frustrate you - attacks that take nearly 10x the damage you're accustomed to taking up to that point, attacks that go the full range of the map, and attacking you from behind cover.  But it gets better: the game rubs this dynamic in further when you die, because you're given essentially three options.  Load your game, which means you're strolling back however far from wherever you last saved; Retry, which lets you try again to beat the boss without walking back to him at a cost of 200 Rupees, or Retry in Hero Mode, which lets you try again to beat the boss without walking back to him AND gives you enough power to do some major damage, at a cost of a staggering 20,000 Rupees.  It's entirely possible these amounts go up as you progress each chapter; I didn't die enough times to verify.  But you can't help but be absolutely livid at the notion that a boss used a cheesy tactic to take you out, costing you precious money to get a second shot at him.  It actually encourages and energizes you to beat the snot out of him when you regenerate.  What's worse though, is that if any one of the three characters dies, it's Game Over.  There is no reviving in this game, which just adds to the challenge.  IF I had to note the most impressive thing about the game, it's the music.  Clearly, Star Ocean was inspirational when deciding what tracks to compose for this game, because it's just as well orchestrated and intricate as SO.  Every theme you encounter has an epic feel without being too overpowering or loud; and the battle music changes depending on what you're doing at any given time.  I can assure you that I'll be getting the soundtrack...that is, if one is ever released, which it probably won't be.  In summary: do I recommend it?  Absolutely.  This is a sleeper hit for sure.  It's a shame that it is being overlooked in favor of other more notable games, and it's even more a shame that Sega has not pushed this one harder.  It almost seems like Sega has just stopped emphasizing the US market since the failure of the Dreamcast which is unfortunate: if not for them, we wouldn't have the types of games we have now.  Resonance of Fate is a must try.  Even if you don't feel comfortable buying it just yet, rent it at least.","If this is wrong, I don't wanna be right.",1269043200,80.0,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},,grind power underleveled horrible reviewer save force radar maybe taste attack star enhancement punishment come theme understand advertise fear ever say spear knee earth powerful market actually exert try one nudity times focal amidst last compose get follow many thing certainly barely expect sure buying force different later date range gamestop really anymore quest enemy regenerate entirely beat glutton control mash possible attack point far notable large curb type end energy surround target bit version rof cheap variety almost screen besides let brother outstanding difficulty metal everything track stand bad visit work arm jump leverage leave hit fancy release difficult purify release show either mega design fantasy large run overall two without power call character's force credit go joke retry tell do example note every may amount review feeling know give trick duty away female clearly much base effort gunslinging character type button sonic like humanity staff extra rub graphic shoot level section come character take might confuse usual cost magna breast hold sword can't encourages nothing unlock dark shame limit definitely assist payne stagger money acquire size well wherever overshadow hope floor rent kick favor one revive invincible change future unravels stop snippet impressive cost sky sega's give shin town random crack amazon certain verify incrementally help time add arcadia call tactic just...different battle...and various chapter damage artillery game also weak see remind multitasking bottom year building game's case ninja create play throwback gear since sega failure die map classic story yet though battle take run behind there's kill use three livable give second undiscovery resonance intricate play i'll use gain extremely basel order cloud however recommend skip boss generally frustrate simply need maximum sufficiently hero think shower...then acrobatic ruin job night war least we've hype bad enough seem take saturn harder contrast mean must fate suppose strategy music unfortunate naturally xiii fairly dynamic nearly soundtrack...that thing god dead attack push sharpness lot go challenge back place visually regular cutscenes train enemy able curious adventure good single use stunning judgment rebuild major trust game result get particular what's overpower background part level introduce bos sleeper porn gaiden start energize man send majority select make underpowered overlook anyway...because watch best distant move assure often chronicle work is/will critical decide destroyed defeat direction overwhelm motion know snot displayed well get final look change bother wild look express air read pop option chance detail quite gear shot die way tactic move depend load valkyria rpgs world juggle cheesy specifically impressed notion mode mish-mash ne something weapon cgi already simple take feel inspirational advance feel livid navigate potent logic hex remain unlike compel shot fact infinite max summary slowly slay technique walk epic precious live reason go loud detail engine large dialogue probably adventurous gun comfortable otherwise male machine night number replenish minute want full skill learn accustomed meeting decide hopefully warn nevermind realize fan promise key challenge mop customize even battle ground skip matter day basically never require bring short push encounter dreamcast orchestrate around ocean emphasize population stroll progress cover seem end party make people discourages essentially available past get old us carta keep absolutely rupees store feature pinch

However, after starting it I was not really blown away (the graphics were amazing but the story was not). However, after you advance and begin to learn to powers the story started to grow on me too and by the time I was finished I immediately started a new game to play through on a harder difficulty and as an evil version of Delsin.  The villain in this game is awesome, I really wish they had more screen time since they make you love to hate them. The graphics in this game are quite possibly the best this gen, so far. The effects and the facial expressions are top notch, though some characters work better than others and a few (the females mainly) came off a bit awkward.  The powers are awesome, and though some are basically clones of the others (blasts, flight) they all have enough little differences to make switching them out not only fun but often necessary to advance. Sadly, all of the enemies have pretty much exactly the same powers and just use them slightly differently. I kept waiting for something big to happen like in the first two games where there were such a large variety of abilities on display (ice, oil/fire, electricity, shape shifting, mind control) but it never happens.  The story has several missed opportunities in my opinion. I would have liked to seen more of Delsin and Reggie's back story and a bit more of an explanation of him being ""the second son"". The relationship between these two is fun to watch, but I'd have liked them to have expanded on that, I never really felt like I got to know them.  Another interesting thing is that the game play often feels much more like a shooter ala Uncharted/Gears of war than an Infamous game. It's not a bad thing really, but kind of odd at times.  I know I had several complaints and if I'd made this review back when I was bored I'd have given it three stars...four at most.

The combination of masochistic children and a deeper chilling backstory makes for an engaging if sometimes puzzling time.  Actually I found there were quite a few humorous moments as well.  The one major drawback, I felt, was that as the game progresses, so do combat sequences, in which the game does not excel.  The controls are for combat are clunky and imprecise.  This tended to get frustrating more than challenging.

Set-up was fairly easy, although the manual does not really cover how to use the remote to control devices; rather it covers how to program the remote to control your devices.  Use of the remote itself is somewhat intuitive, but it can be a little confusing figuring out the in's and outs.  As for setting up this remote to control my devices, it was fairly easy. I was able to use the ""auto search"" method to program my tv, but was unable to do the same for my soundbar.  The problem was that while entering auto search for my sound bar, the television would turn off while the remote was searching for codes. The device turning off is a sign that the remote has found an acceptable code to control the device, so by the television turning off first, the remote never found the sound bar. No problem. I manually entered the four digit code for my sound bar and was all set.  Now here's the great part about this remote. My television is a smart-tv and it's hard to find a 3rd party universal remote that allows me to access the smart-tv functionality.  Just take a look. Most universal remotes under 50 dollars don't have a button that allows you to bring up your apps, main menu, etc.  Well, this remote has a ""learning"" option, which allows you to program one of the four colored buttons on the remote to ""learn"" a function the remote otherwise didn't do.  So I followed the directions and was able to ""teach"" this remote to bring up my smart apps, main menu and input selection for my soundbar.  Note: the green colored button is set by default to control input functionality.  So far so good. Again, setup wasn't as easy as it could have been, and as many others are stating in their reviews, there are some apps that do not as of yet allow use of the remote, but hey, I went from using two remotes and a controller to just one. Oh, and not having to use the controller to pause and rewind movies is worth the price of admission on its own. Great product.

Resident Evil 2 (1998) was my favorite game in the series until this one came along.  Although some aspects of the original story, (if not all) have been lost in translation, and the now defunct zombies that have been replaced by psychotic cultists sometimes make you ask, and why is this called Resident Evil 4?  Still, if your not a die hard zombie fan who is easily disappointed, then this is the game for you.  Some older fans such as myself, may miss the old spookiness, and impending doom you always felt from being surrounded by zombies, however this game has its own little perks, the bad guys for instance are far more intelligent NPCs then the original games, they can follow you almost anywhere once they have you in their sights, and they are not afraid to open doors, I had a lot of fun waiting for a bad guy to walk through a door, and blow him away with the shotgun. The bosses are almost all unique and original, except for the first boss, I can't help be reminded of the boss from Resident Evil 2 in the sewer.  The bad guys are plentiful and can at times be a challenge, but never to the point of frustration,  the sequences are strait out of a Hollywood horror, from being surrounded by freaks in a house, to death defying maneuvers that must be preformed almost precisely to win.

2043,181769,4,False,"03 9, 2009",A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B001O1QLDO,Michael Kerner,"There is no question about the success of the Nintendo Wii, and how much it has reintroduced video games to the next generation. But with Nintendo's last home system, the Gamecube, it was sadly overshadowed with hard core video game fanatics in favor of the Playstation 2, Xbox 360 and the original Xbox. Still, Nintendo went forward and created a lot of great titles for the system. But, for those gamers who own the Wii, also forget that those Gamecube games that were traded away for credit for other games, that they can still be played on the Wii. So, when I found out that Nintendo was going to re-issue some of their biggest Nintendo Gamecube titles onto the Wii, I was a bit skeptical to see how they would work. That does come with a simple plumber service to an ace.  Mario Power Tennis, the classic Nintendo Gamecube game which is now available for the Nintendo Wii, brings in a lot of the action and thrill on the tennis court of Mario's world, to the Wii audience for a new generation of gamers. The game features all your favorite characters as was before including Wario, Peach, Bowser, Mario, and hidden gems like Wiggler the caterpillar, Boo, and Birdo. The graphics have been remastered beautfully, in a redesigned widescreen presentation for the HD look, and the sound is just as good as before. There are so many great courts here from Bowser's castle, to the Warioware factory, the quaint Delfino Island from Super Mario Sunshine, and even a trip back in time with the classic Mario Brothers court, which is a nostalgic glimpse into the original 1983 Mario Brothers game before Super Mario Brothers, with bees, crabs and coins to collect on the court in a beatiful vintage 80's design.  Sadly though, there are a few disadvantages to Mario Power Tennis for the Wii. The first is the control. It takes awhile for Wii owners to get used to from the beginning, if you've mastered the original one for the Gamecube it would be a little frustrating at first, but would be easier down the road serving with the Wii-mote as a tennis racket. The second problem is that you can't use the data from the Gamecube version on the Wii version. If you have a Wii and have the Gamecube memory card with data from the original Mario Power Tennis, you'd have to start over with the gameplay and unlock everything again from the characters to the gimmick courts. It is untrasferrable from the Gamecube card.  All in all, I was a bit surprised that Nintendo chose not to make a new version of Mario Tennis for the Wii, and instead re-release the Gamecube version for the Wii. Still, Mario Power Tennis is a fun treat for hardcore tennis fans young and old, and a delight for nostalgic fans of aces and deuces alike. If you've already beaten the original for the Gamecube and still own it, there is no need to buy the new one. Nevertheless, Mario Power Tennis is sure to serve up a really fun time for new tennis buffs and hard core Mario Sports games fans alike.

2050,300468,4,False,"01 19, 2015",ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00CFR7UC2,David Swan,"Itd been a decade since Nintendo released a Mario Golf game and I confess Ive never been a huge fan of the series. I played Toadstool Tour but the fun wore off fairly quickly. Ive been playing a lot of World Tour and what tends to keep me coming back are the unlockables but even those tend to disappoint. The mechanics of the game are very simple. The game shows the player where your ball will land discounting any factors such wind and terrain and then the player chooses a club, adjusts for all factors and swings away. The swinging of the club involves two moments where you need to press the A button at the right moment. If you mistime your ball won't fly as far or as accurately.  Getting the ball into the hole at Par doesnt tend to be that difficult. Getting a Birdie is more difficult and Ive gotten less than a handful of Eagles one Albatross and just one Hole in One. A yellow arrow will show you where your ball will end up after landing and rolling but this estimate factors in none of the variables and can be very deceptive. If, for instance, you are hitting from a lower grade onto a cliff the yellow arrow may be way off and not only do you have to overcompensate but you have to put a lot of top spin on. Likewise, when you compensate for wind you also have to think about distance from the hole. A light breeze may blow the ball further off line when aiming at a distant hole that a heavy gust that is a short distance away. In order to play a round of golf well under par you're going to have to do some heavy mental arithmetic. Even then I think that World Tour can be a bit inconsistent. When you try to time your swing its hard to get perfection and I would expect that the worse you mistime the more off your shot will be but Ive had times where Ive been close to on and my shot veered off wildly. This can ruin a hole and in an 18 hole round, which takes not an insignificant amount of time to complete, this can be quite frustrating as the whole round can be ruined.  There are three 18 round golf course and six 9 round courses that all need to be unlocked. There is an additional 18 round course that is one on one in as in you have to get on the green in one shot and in the hole in the second. There are an additional six 18 hole courses that are available for download for $14.99. To say Im not thrilled with DLC would be an understatement. Basically youll be playing the same course A LOT. The other unlockables are clothing but that can be disappointing. There is a TON of clothing including shoes, pants, hat etc and they affect your stats but the variety of modifiers is very low. There are dozens and dozens of shirts but only four possibly modifiers including the initial short which has no modifier. Other apparel like shoes, gloves and hats only come in two varieties of modifiers. Unless you're REALLY into fashion or a completions you can get all the modifier combinations very quickly and fully tailor your character. You can also get suits like Mario suit or Princess Peach suit but those are generally inferior to what you can do on your own with choosing clothing piecemeal. As far as Ive seen there are no superior items. Just items with different colors and patterns. For instance the Gold Mario Clubs have the exact same modifiers as the Koopa Clown Car Clubs.  Possibly the coolest part is being able to compete against players all over the world in tournaments. So far the only tournaments Ive seen are either courses that come with the game or courses that come as DLC which I cant play because I didn't purchase the DLC. I always end up far from the top of the leaderboard since you're always going to be competing against fanatics. If you're a fanatic yourself then maybe youll do great. If I get 4 to 8 under par Im happy (my best is 13 under par) but some people are getting in the high 20s which on an 18 hole course means they're getting nearly an Eagle per hole.

2063,397530,4,False,"11 17, 2015",A2LLVLJ84Q8JUH,B00WL9PSYG,DICE,"Overall, Star Wars Battlefront for me has just been an OK experience.  The PROs: - Beautiful graphics and sound. - Vehicles can be fun and add another facet to master - Massive maps with a large multiplayer feel - Slit screen! - Seamless with very few apparent glitch or laggy areas even with the massive maps - Similar to original from the consoles - Cards and card upgrades are a decent idea  CONS: - Repetitive: So far this game can be a bit repetitive with limited replay-ability you do play either rebels, alliance, and sometimes a hero as well as have maps with multiple types of vehicles. The deluxe ed comes with a few extra items but overall there is a slightly limited amount of weapons and gear at this time. Not much itemized progression or awards at this time either but Im sure there will be more additions soon. - Mechanics: Some of the mechanics are simple. In this game there are some maps with lots of AIs. There is no bullet drop (because they are lasers) or leading targets (some say you do... I have not experienced the need yet), or spread differences when moving. It is still comparable to most shooters. At least headshots do way more damage. - Add-Ons: They plan to release around double the amount of maps than what they currently have, but it will cost a pretty penny (around $50). - Gameplay: Mostly online gameplay which is why I bought it but I can see why some people will not like this. - 40 Player maps: Not a large con, the idea is amazing, but the execution in this game is pretty Chaotic.  POTENTIAL FLAWS: - Damage Alerts: There is no damage alert, your screen does not go red when low health, and there is no vibration or registration when you are being shot in game. If you are not watching your health or listening closely to your speakers you won't know you are being hit unless you are facing your target.  OVERALL: Star Wars Battlefront is definitely a decent game. At this point of time though, pre-patch and updates, there seems to be some work needed with gameplay mechanics. I don't think most would really regret buying it but with the many decent games on the horizon, I feel it would be worth-while to hold out on it at this time.

2066,3269,5,False,"01 4, 2007",A1ZX4B566H5BCN,B00000JRSB,fallowstarz,"Although this game is frequently criticized for featuring ""angsty characters"" and a large number of anime and video game cliches, critics of this game's plot should consider that fan perception of the originality of this game has been lessened considerably by the future inclusion of similar character and plot dynamics in the final fantasy series, particularly in FFVIII and FFX. This video game features truly incredible storytelling, and this game should be called cinematic not just because of the inclusion of FMV, but because of the large number of visual metaphors expressed in the game's visual direction. Consider the parallel between the stars in the game's opening and the sparks Aerith watches shooting out of the open electrical panel, or the fact that Midgar's poor literally live underneath its rich. The low-polygon-count 3-D presentation of this game gives it a visual style which emphasizes the geometric nature of objects, and the producers of the game have changed a technical limitation into a stylistic enhancement. The game's usage of light and dark, squalor and cleanliness, gloom and beauty, give it a literary theme of naturalism, by representing the products of human technology as ugly. The sweeping ""theme of Final Fantasy VII"", which compliments the wide-open world map prior to the summoning of Meteor, is first hinted at in ""Holding my Thoughts in My Heart,"" which plays at the precipice of the dystopian technopolis of Midgar. The game's various themes communicate the producers' vision of which environments represent hell, and which represent heaven. Even the ironic real-life double-meaning of ""finding the promised land"" is parallelled in the game by Shinra's misinterpretation of the religion of Aerith's race. The game spends a lot of time exploring the identities of the characters of Cloud, Aerith, Tifa and Sephiroth through dreams, memories, and hallucinations, and rather than including definitive, conclusive scenes in which the whole truth of the characters are revealed, the game challenges you, much like a David Lynch film, to discover the reality of various events by logically reconciling the various perspectives from which they are viewed. This is ""angsty storytelling"" at its most beautiful, as it challenges the players to make an effort to understand the characters, much in the same ways that the game designers would probably like to see more interpersonal understanding within humanity.  This game improved upon the limit breaks of FF6, which could only be used by deliberately keeping the characters at dangerously low HP levels, by adding the limit bar, and the barrier and mbarrier bars also made combat more interesting, leading many players to wonder why they were subsequently removed from the series. Some minor design flaws in this game include the three-character limit in battle, which reduces the player's ability to diversify the roles of the heroes, and leads the player, on a logical level, to wonder why the other heroes are unable to participate. Also, the overavailability of gil makes purchasing weapons and items too easy, and minimalizes the usefulness of alternate methods for party growth, such as stealing weapons and items.  If the battles as a whole seem too easy in this game, it is because the game was designed with the intention of challenging the player to experience it, rather than challenging the player to get through it. The game is filled with a variety of fun methods for winning battles, from high-powered summons to enemy skills, and some otherwise difficult boss battles become unloseable after equipping a specific accessory. Part of the coolness of this game is the fact that it was the first major RPG to allow the players to develop extremely poweful heroes, by combining abilities such as auto-resurrection, auto-haste, multiple counter attacks, mp absorbtion, and much more. In other words, the lack of challenge is largely deliberate, and designed to give the players freedom to choose which resources to throw at a particular battle, rather than forcing the players to throw everything they have at most battles in order to have a chance for victory. The inessential-but-fun nature of the sidegames, such as snowboarding and chocobo-breeding, mirrors the inessential-but-fun nature of the majority of the special abilities in this game which may be used during battle.  FF VII must also be commended for the distinctively unique visual design of every dungeon and section of the map. Walking on the snowy north continent of the overworld, leaving footprints in the snow, feels completely different than walking in the shadow of Midgar, and getting lost in previously-unexplored environments, such as the chaotically-mapped Great Glacier, is more of a pleasure than an annoyance. Experimenting with different characters and weapons is fun in this game, and this is complimented by visual touches which were unique to this game at the time of its release, such as showing a different weapon in the battle character model's hand, depending on what is equipped.  I played FFI, FFIV, and FFVI before this game, and on my first playthrough of FFVII, I mourned the absence of some elements included in FFVI, such as multi-party battles, and FFVI's non-linear second act, but in time, I came to realize that in terms of characterization and presentation, FFVII is the quintessential Final Fantasy game.","Ahead of its own time in graphics; ahead of our current time in fun, immersive storytelling",1167868800,2.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,visual player product gloom combat hell bar realize diversify come theme poweful understand identity player ffvi presentation mourn get electrical weapon many allow spends open view different direction non-linear ability roles footprint star fun keep playthrough enemy heaven part high-powered ability panel multi-party conclusive method wide-open ironic emphasize david parallel inessential-but-fun ffiv mbarrier variety find flaws theme would ffvii heart particularly everything explore quintessential logically include lead release difficult experience producer design fantasy prior improve special steal combine race mp call criticize ugly precipice watch remove every may hint give mirror minimalizes much originality effort unloseable coolness character hero hp plot lynch like thought humanity angsty way level shadow sephiroth section annoyance parallel could freedom double-meaning character spark chocobo-breeding open dark sidegames within limit alternate dungeon element unique accessory vision interpersonal technology aerith's minor technical dystopian upon deliberate compliment metaphor term future make equipped whole definitive hold give subsequently become first item pleasure tifa time various ffx limitation game also dynamic see ff stylistic previously-unexplored human incredible rich game's overavailability choose object absorbtion represent style map enhancement growth include battle perception fill summons snowy reconcile rather film fmv second force three-character express gil feature played hand religion extremely order cloud event cliche commend lead reduces reality counter usefulness distinctively vii poor critic wonder leave act largely considerably must overworld although purchase interesting scene sweep play attack frequently characterization series lot challenge experiment low-polygon-count continent represent snow similar beautiful low consider use add designer literary design major hallucination barrier misinterpretation particular cinematic truth level win bos usage discover challenge majority make word beauty break equip specific communicate final land lessen cleanliness ffvi's chance midgar's reveal real-life touch perspectives memory depend player's environment ffviii world completely model's auto-haste shoot squalor video absence nature naturalism weapon great multiple feel bar deliberately anime aerith meteor storytelling include fact shinra's geometric change show underneath walk glacier live develop lose large probably summon truly otherwise inclusion lack participate number light skill resource dream auto-resurrection fan challenge promise literally dangerously even chaotically-mapped midgar battle easy north logical rpg unable compliment seem intention snowboarding make party get victory ffi throw understand technopolis feature

The game will make your pulse pound, and your fingers ache. The next villain, Corroder, is almost as intense as Sledgehammer, chasing you through an abandonded water-works, with hiding places more sparing, again leads to great, exciting game play. But then you get to level 3 and Chopper...a very annoying, feminine slasher that just gets on the nerves and doesn't do much to keep you jumping. The same goes for the bizarro ballerina's turned slashers on level 4, Scissorman and Scissorwoman. Neither character produced chills, and the high pitched taunts issued by both would-be killers get more annoying than frightening as the game progresses. The final boss, Lord Borroughs, is also a disappointment. After making your way through four pretty tough levels, your left facing off against...an English Gentleman??? The gameplay is quite fun, and I enjoyed the concept of running and hiding from killer spirits, armed only with holy water, but the fright factor drops considerably after the first two levels.

2090,126148,5,False,"04 14, 2011",A3JWUUSLIGTBHM,B000ZK9QCS,ChrisInCali,"It has come to this, the final act of the God of War trilogy featuring Kratos. A culmination of rage, vengeance, and hope all come together in the limelight to reveal the breathtaking epic that Kratos has come to Olympus for. You are Kratos, a man without a future who fights for the past - a man who is brutal (oh, and brutally honest too) to the core. Will Kratos finally get revenge, or will it end in a triumphant failure? That's for you to find out; either way - in the end, there will be only chaos.  God of War III picks up right where God of War II left off - climbing to the top of Olympus to wreak havoc upon the Gods and Zeus himself. For those who aren't familiar with the series - Santa Monica does a decent job at recapping some of the recent events for newcomers. Some will be picking this up on a whim, so they may be lost between translation during certain scenes, since the God of War games are bridged with one another completely and it is best to have played the previous iterations for the best possible experience. Still, God of War III will leave you floored - it's just that the story could have been presented a bit better to newcomers.  If you've played previous God of War games and are looking for more, look no further. GoW3 features the same core gameplay mechanics from its predecessors with added depth and speed. You can real-time weapon switch in-between combos, adding more combo variations, cancellations, and air juggles. Everything runs fairly smooth in the game, thanks to the variable 40-60 frames-per-seconds. This is what makes combat much more fluid and responsive. The combat is just as visceral as ever, with grotesque context-sensitive finishers from Kratos, and lots of blood spillage all over the place - a neat technology employed by Santa Monica is a dynamic blood stain effect that not only affects enemies and your surroundings, but can smear all over Kratos as well.  When you first start the game, you can choose from three difficulties: Spartan (easy), God (normal), Titan (hard), and you can unlock Chaos (very hard) mode after you beat the game. Starting on normal and you'd breeze through the game. For a challenging and heart-pounding experience, it is recommended that you start on Titan mode. The difficulty is balanced just about right, with some really tough and frustrating parts, but nothing you can not overcome and endure.  To break up the intense action sequences, there are some light platforming sequences with puzzles here and there. The puzzles aren't too hard or too easy, some even require a train of thought. Level design is expertly catered to around these puzzles, but there might be one in particular that can leave a player frustrated. Some of the later areas can be a bit frustrating and almost unfair at times, and it's what bogs down the experience just a bit on the final stretches of the game.  The visuals and artistic direction in GoW3 is simply stunning. You will be floored at times, especially during key boss battles. Parts of this game are things never before seen in video games this generation - it's just a marvelous feat from Santa Monica with the scale so HUGE, it's almost unbelievable at times. All textures are loaded, so you will experience no texture pop-in whatsoever. No load times, no install, 40-60 FPS and you've got to wonder how they did it.  The stunning conclusion to the trilogy should leave fans humbled, but obviously wanting more from the series. With such epic presentation and over-the-top battles, it can't just end here for God of War. Whether you're a fan of God of War, a newcomer to the series, or someone that takes an interest in action games - you owe it to yourself to play this game and witness its magnificence.

2093,81234,4,False,"03 2, 2007",A39PDV8ISJIJ55,B000FDOTIQ,SkunkDave,"Though you can argue (and have done so) that the game is overly punctuated by too many loading screens and cutscenes, I have to say that the cutscenes did a lot for the plot. Actually, it was refreshing to play a Playstation 2 shooter with a passable (and then some) plot. And though the level designs and gameplay were a little simplistic, the game engine itself seemed to be very well executed. For some reason, (production value? coding expertise?) the hit detection, graphical finesse/performance, collision fields, and flexibility of the game mechanic was far above the previous shooters of the system. For instance, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood was fantastic, but looked worse, had extreme graphical slowdown during action, and technically could hardly decipher a headshot from a mere graze. The main flaw of this game is the substandard analog sticks and now dated performance of the Playstation 2 system. But if I had to choose, I'd rather continue to play well-executed, well-animated, well-musically-scored, and well-styled Playstation 2 games than spend 400-600 dollars to play next-gen games which still have the training wheels still on.  Like Vincent, who brawls and shoots but doesn't particular dominate in either regard, this game delivers in RPG and shooter respects but doesn't really impress. In it's own way, again, this was refreshing. Having beaten most shooters and RPGs for the last... oh, seven consoles or so, it was a nice change to get to enjoy both without chugging through 4 discs worth of random encounters. The gameplay isn't really stressful... there is no real feeling of missed something or messing something up, and you can always die on purpose if you want more money or experience. It's nice to come home and sit down to something enjoyable between the demands of adult life.  Though there is certainly room for improvement, I think Dirge is a solid contribution to the almost non-existent genre of RPG-shooter. I'd like to see where these ideas can be taken to, especially in the online gaming environment. I hope Square doesn't become scared by the apparent lack of consumer support for this one. It's walking a fine line: if you're a big FFVII fan, you'll probably hate it. If you're luke-warm, you'll probably like it. And if you just like shooters, or maybe even Parasite Eve, you'll probably be somewhere in between. Still, every time this developer steps out of line from their cash-cow franchises (though making a spin-off FF game can only in all fairness be said to be a ""baby step""), I firmly believe they still have the capacity to deliver unusual and worthwhile game experiences, just like with Einhander, Bushido Blade, and maybe even the Brave Fencer Musashi ""series"".","Jack of all trades, master of none.",1172793600,6.0,,,feel simplistic well-executed seven game nice date capacity baby maybe dominate performance rpg-shooter mechanic genre dollar dirge enjoy wheel plot way screen like adult say value console level beaten load could come fine actually rpgs firmly think room cash-cow passable action chug mere next-gen execute last enjoyable environment get scar delivers slowdown non-existent mess brother many bad i'd certainly contribution developer analog fencer punctuate change regard big instance respect something solid expertise making take blade real oh blood headshot money spin-off musashi refreshing seem looked well-styled line shoot hope little somewhere idea really consumer one detection play square franchise series lot fairness technically walk argue improvement cutscenes far train reason demand believe graze home experience decipher engine online probably worth random shooter become lack step hardly game want almost well-musically-scored time hate flexibility design impress especially stressful spend particular disc fantastic ffvii luke-warm stick vincent unusual substandard game fan production still encounter missed cod earned arm see even eve ff hit field brave step shooter deliver collision einhander sit playstation purpose well-animated choose experience rpg main either bushido graphical continue die gameplay previous without though system life finesse/performance apparent flaw worthwhile brawl well overly say extreme do always parasite every rather support

2097,175206,4,False,"07 20, 2009",AMN8IO2QVW5AY,B001EM1DK4,Patrick Mcnelis,"A lot of the complaints people are posting here revolve around 2 issues: The content of the game compared to Sims 2; and to the computing power required to run it.  Regarding the first complaint category, this is indeed not The Sims 2.  Unfortunately, people seem that have expected that EA would have rolled everything that was available to the Sims 2 world (all of its expansions and their favorite fan mods) and launched them as a part of The Sims 3.  They forget that Sims 2 was not all that it is now when it was launched.  It was, compared to all it is today, a hollow shell.  Of course you weren't going to get all of those expansions rolled into this game.  EA knows the drill and how to make money off of this franchise.  Expansions that you can purchase...which will likely be an awful lot like the Sims 2 expansions...will be rolling onto the shelves before long.  I bet by Christmas there are at least 2 in time for the holiday rush.  Regarding the second issue: this game requires a great deal more computing power because it is running higher rez graphics over the area of the entire town.  Sims 2 only loaded one lot at a time.  Sims 3 is having to render the entire town, and run calculation on the activities of the non-player characters.  It is obviously going to take a great deal more computing resources to make this game run at top resolutions.  I have a AMD Phenom II 940 Black Edition on the latest Gigabyte board with a GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 with 1782MB of DDR3 on board, and 8GB of Corsair PC8500 RAM and I can run the game at max settings at 1920-1200.  I've read here people having difficulty running it on a laptop running a Celeron processor.  Of course you will...Celeron is a budget CPU meant for laptops and low-end office computers.  It is not a gaming CPU...and this game does require a bit more robust CPU.  You CAN play it, however...you just have to scale back the graphics.  If you don't have a high-end gaming PC, you will need to come to grips with the fact that you cannot run anti-aliasing at x4 and anisotropic filtering at x16...you just can't.  I have played this on my laptop at reasonably acceptable frame rates.  My laptop is a budget Toshiba Satellite 9400 series with a dual core AMD and 4GB of RAM running graphics though the onboard mobile Geforce 9600 GTS.  In all, the game delivers on all of its promises.  There were issues at launch, but it is difficult to point a finger at any one game that experiences launch glitches when darn near every game out there does the same thing.  Those issues have been or are being resolved.  There is a price to pay for wanting to be the first kid on your block to play a particular game, and wading into the unknown is one of them. If you aren't sure...give it till Christmas...guaranteed that EA has all of the glitches ironed out and they've figured out a way to make the game run faster on lower-end computers and will have a patch out for it (or even integrated into the latest versions).  The game is as fun as any of the other Sims games, and maybe even more so.  I like that you can move about the town and interact with anyone.  No more having to wait for them to come to you.  If you see them in town, you can go to them.  And watching your Sim drive around town instead of watching a load screen is much more enjoyable.  Yes, there are only 2 towns right now...one in the box and one you can download...but you know more are coming.  Yes you can add and delete houses from the existing towns.  Don't believe people who say you cannot...you can.  You can even choose to evict the entire town and remove all of the buildings...re-purpose the lots...add your own custom buildings or download them from any of the fan mod sites...change your active household...etc.  Go and have fun with this game.

I have played a few hours into it, but I doubt that my opinion will change much from now until I complete it.

Enemies can take you out in just a couple hits if you don't watch yourself, so the dodge function is an ABSOLUTE must.

Surely, most of you have noticed or heard about the Sims 4 having a split neighborhood system rather than the full open world the Sims 3 had to offer. In my honest opinion, I really wish they had kept the open world aspect rather than worry about performance issues, but on the brightside, lower end PCs can handle the Sims 4.  I have played the game since its launch to its most recent patch, and I honestly got used to the gameplay and style. I personally enjoy the fact that emotions play a larger part in the Sims 4, and what really tops my list would have to be the multitask feature that I have been waiting for since the Sims 2! You wouldn't believe how much I wanted to eat chips and watch TV at the same time or even read a book in the restroom! Sure, it may not sound like much to most people, but it just adds that touch of realism.  It should be noted that this game may disappoint the hardcore Sims 3 lover. I was also let down in the beginning of The Sims 4's launch, but eventually they slowly fixed their minor wrongs which made me enjoy the game a little bit more. (Thank goodness for bringing back the pools!) All in all, the Sims 4 plays similar to Sims 2 in the fact that you can pretty much only fool around on your own lot and have to go through loading screens just to go to community lots and such. That was thing I didn't really miss, but as a major Sims 2 fan, I don't really mind the ""single lot"" system. At least the Sims 4 included somewhat of a neighborhood which needs to be occupied, rather than go fully back to its roots.  Now for the premium goodies. You get access to 3  DLC 1.

There are a few points that need some attention and one of them really detracts from the game.  Graphics are solid but not as good as I'd hoped.  Multiplayer campaign is much appreciated, but I hate the fact that you have to stick SO close to your partner. I got stuck and killed a number of times because of this. In future installments, they really should get rid of this.  The one thing that REALLY bothered me about this game was the ""realism."" It would be great if it really was realistic, and I'm surprised I haven't seen others comment on this. Lets talk about bullet drop folks....  Bullet drop is something that any sniper has to deal with. But most of the sniper rounds in WWII fired a .308 or larger round. So what you say? Sit tight... About the longest shot you will make in this game is 200 yards, MAYBE 240. I can tell you after many years of shooting in real life that at 200 yards bullet drop will be negligible with those types of rounds. But in the game you have to target so high above their heads to account for the drop that its just comical. 200 yards would BARELY change your point of aim. 500-1000 yards, then you are talking some more drastic adjustment, but 200 yards or less--no way. As I said, if it really were more realistic this would be a cool feature. But they made the bullet drop 10 times worse than it is in real life and that really annoyed me.",Good but needs some refinement,1148083200,4.0,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},,surprised yard comical realistic stuck much maybe shot type rid way round like feature say graphic round need others shoot time tight multiplayer get folk high point negligible length many bad thing i'd barely installment change something solid great real wwii see really one fact blast tell future deal make account point large mention good sniper annoy less--no talk appreciated target number long cool hate let get would comment everything game close talk attention fire aim drastic adjustment drop year sit make head review i'm bullet stick campaign life kill go partner say detracts realism hop bother

I love The Sims but lately I have refused to dish out any more money to them until EA started to make some quality content.  To-date, I still don't own ""Generations.""  I mean, come on, a mid-life crisis ep?!  Their entire creative team banged their heads on their desks and that's what came out?! I play The Sims to escape real life not recreate it!  After much trepidation, I'm pleased to inform you that ""Pets"" definitely did not disappoint.  I've been playing it for about six hours straight and this expansion has managed to rekindle my passion for Sims.  It's refreshing and puts a completely new spin on how you can play the game.  What really makes this particular version of pets stand out from the others is your ability to control the animals.  Finally!  I know in Sims 2 there was a cheat but you could never cancel actions, only queue them up.  This led to annoying little situations where your sim couldn't possible step OVER the sleeping cat to get into the shower.  But this is no longer an issue.  You are in complete control of your pets and, even better, the pets are almost completely self-sustaining if you turn on free will.  So you get all of the pros and very few of the cons found in previous pets expansions.  The dogs and cats are very similar to that found in Sims 2.  They're cute, they're fun.  Aside from the fact that you can tell the dog to NOT destroy the furniture, there's not much to report.  Which brings us to the horses.  At long last, EA has heard our pleas!  The horses are fantastic and really make the game feel ""different.""  I really appreciated the fact that you can see the sim mounting and dismounting.  A nice touch compared to the way they just suddenly appear in cars. The horses are a form of transportation so you can pretty much toodle around the entire town on one and never get a car.  There is a new town in this ep.  I found Appaloosa Plains to be rather charming.  It very much feels like a laid back country town.  It has a dive bar to hang out along with all of the buildings from ""Ambitions.""  Many of the houses are sprawling ranches instead of suburbia feeling.  I highly recommend Pets.  It's definitely one of the best expansions so far for the Sims 3.  It actually feels like EA put effort into making it.  Like it's really something new rather than just a glorified stuff pack.

The campaign can be played with up to four people, however only two can play on a single system. You can play through the story with or without scoring allowing for playing for fun or more competitive play. The skulls that have been in the previous game have been improved to allow options making the campaign more difficult but also creating the possibility for a higher score.  The multiplayer aspect to the game is great too and also has been improved. Up to 4 people can play together on a single system, online or local/system link. If you have more people playing they do not need an xbox live gold account, but without one the can not play in ranked matches. Matchmaking is a new improvement to Halo 3. Instead of waiting in lobbies the game will match you up with people who want to play similar game types. You can always party up with people you find that you want to continue playing with. Also, if you have a party of friends you can play on custom games which allows you to play your choice of game types and completely change the options.  There is also two new modes, forge and theater. Theater is the simplest mode that allows you to play back your previous matches. While playing them you can create snapshots or movies of your favorite moments, then upload them to you [...] profile. Forge is great as well, because you can edit the layout of the maps and create your own custom game types. These edits can also be uploaded to bungie's website.  The final integration is that [...] website. It tracks all of your statistics and your rank. It allows you to compare your performance to that of your friends. Also all of the uploaded pictures and films of your friends can be downloaded. However, since the films are in game data they can only be viewed in the game. You can also download game modes. So if your friend made the ""most awesome game type ever!"" you can download it and play against them in it in custom games. The website allows you to queue up to eight items to download the next time you turn on the game. Pictures you can download right away and use on your computer. Its nice.  So, at first glance this might appear like a small update it is a pretty full package, even if you just buy the regular version of the game. It won't be hard to find people to play against in this game, and the formula that made Halo and Halo 2 is still there, with some improvements. Even if you didn't like Halo or Halo 2 I would still recommend trying this as it really fills out what was missing in those games.

I've heard of style and I've heard to rockstaring a world, but this place was something else. It was like a nightmare had mixed with the show Oz and had spilled out on the screen, making a mixed bag of atmosphere and a world where squalor rules. In some parts I felt like I was walking into a world where the homless gathered around barrels and warmed themselves, hoping to keep the Boogeyman at bay. In other places I felt like a drug manufacturing facility owned the night, creating a horrific variation of the world where addiction and murder liked to vacation.  In all of this, you play a person tasked with the job of hunting down killers. It isn't an easy job and it isn't a nice thing. You get your hands dirty and you see things that are really out of most people's elements as you crime through the sreets in search of the things going bump in the night. Unlike many games these monsters wear human faces and have base needs, but they are warped records and play on savage music in the middle of this strange wasteland. At times it seems like this place would drive your character to madness. Other times it all makes sense, with this world making both the victims, the killers, and the dogs of war that hunt them in their own homes.  As far as the gameplay, it is also dirty. It is sometimes base and it is sometimes a bit unfriendly, but it is easy to learn and easy to keep going. Some people do not like the speed of it all, saying it is slow. That can be true sometimes, but this is something to slip into. We leave the FPS at the door and get to know things aobut the world that ar enot greeting card civilities.

It's mostly a series of timed target and critter shooting with increasing levels of difficulty (at least as much as I've explored so far).  If you like shooters that are more cartoonish, this one is pretty decent.  The drawback, however, is the game controller attachment - the thing you connect your controller and nunchuk to so you can more easily do the actual shooting and maneuvering.  In short, it's really awful.  In order to use it properly, one must put the left hand on the back to maneuver, the right hand on the front and aim pretty much like a dweeb who has never shot any kind of firearm.  Movement is awkward while firing and firing is extremely inaccurate while moving.  The best thing to do is to try to use the controller as a pistol (although it fails at that due to the two-handed design and the front-grip on it for shooting instead of the back grip).  To list the controller's drawbacks: 1. The length is too short for a rifle-style shooter. 2. Integrating the nunchuk into the weapon was a stroke of stupidity for any kind of shooter.  As a rifle, the hand placement is backwards.  Even when shooting a pistol, if one does it two handed, the left hand is cupping the right, not six inches behind the right hand. You'll do better in the game if you leave the nunchuk unattached and use it in your free hand. 3. Stand WAY BACK from your television to get any similarity between your aim point on the screen and the place the target gets hit.  (At least 10 feet) 4. If you have the rechargeable battery pack, the Wii controller it has a real hard time fitting into the module.  Try not to force it or it will break.

So when I heard that they were making a game, I couldn't wait and I think the wait was worth it.  Now before I continue you should know that this is not a game to revolutionize games, its just a really fun puzzle game. Let's start with the puzzles. The puzzles are of a good variety from manipulating rooms to find the combination, manipulating your perspective so you know which way to go, and pretty much all of the traps that you have come to love from the saw movies.  Some of these will challenge you, and actually make you think, because you will have to really change the way you look at some of these puzzles in order to finish them. Another part is the combat.  Now its not the best set up, but you get used to it.  The character does hit a little slow, but that did not stop me from finishing it.  You will use weapons from the nail bat, shovel, scalpel, and a revolver.  Also you will find schematics in order to create traps, you can also disarm and rearm the shotgun trip wire traps for anyone that might be following you. I will say that you will be picking locks, setting fuses, and shutting off gas pipes a good amount.  This is the repetitive part of the game, but its not that bad. I should mention that this is probably a game for saw fans only.  That is because unless you like the story, characters, and all around saw atmosphere, you might not be able to get past the less then perfect combat or some of the repetitive puzzles.  But I will tell you why you should give it a try anyway.  One is the length, this is one of the few games with a good length in the campaign so you will not be done in like three hours.  Another reason is the trophies,  if you are looking for trophies then this is your game.  I finished the game today and only needed one more trophy before a platinum.

Durham,"A few years ago, a little game called Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction was released, and was a surprisingly great take on the Marvel character with free-roaming and destructive environments, plus the overall feeling gameplay-wise that you really were the Hulk.  This new movie tie-in Incredible Hulk game from Sega seems to want to follow in the same footsteps, but alas, it is a disappointing, and quite frankly boring, next-gen smash-a-thon.  Smashing up a pretty looking New York City is as fun as one would hope, and is by far the best aspect of the game to be sure. After that though, things begin to go downhill in terms of gameplay and overall presentation.  Once you get bored with just causing destruction, the gameplay elements at their core just aren't that varied, and the boss fights are underwhelming as well.  Graphically, the game looks halfway decent for a PS2 game (bot not as good as Ultimate Destruction did), but there are noticeable graphical glitches and occasional bugs that hamper the experience.  Oddly enough as well, just like with the Iron Man game that was recently released, the game's cut-scenes are just plain bad.  The good points of the game once again involve laying waste to the environment, and the film's star's, including Edward Norton, lend their voices as well.  Considering how enjoyable Ultimate Destruction was and still is, it's disappointing how Incredible Hulk ends up faring.  It's worth a look for Hulk fans, but in the end, you're better off sticking with an old copy of Ultimate Destruction.",Disappointing,1213574400,6.0,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},,feel look cut-scenes cause involve downhill destructive quite bug hamper consider tie-in like ala halfway movie york smash character environment noticeable frankly core presentation lay next-gen destruction star's enjoyable lend aspect follow get environment point enough norton seem take voice stick sure great element begin fare iron fan well gameplay-wise edward surprisingly fun little hope thing really one fight film's free-roaming new term waste bot far good city worth vary boring copy want would boss underwhelming bad ago game decent still end footsteps year recently plain man incredible occasional graphically game's release experience plus marvel glitch hulk graphical disappointing best overall sega old gameplay look though include call end bore go well ultimate oddly look smash-a-thon pretty

There was a reason for it. :)  I do not want to be instantly harsh on it, because the reality, I had a good time with it. For those that do not know...Americans made this Final Fantasy. I could stop there. That is not to bash my country but back then, we were not known for our strong game development skills when it came to RPGs, especially with a strong pedogree like the Japanese studio Square was known for. (Namesake only for this one)  With JRPG's being all the rage back then, it was a shock that this game was even developed to begin with. It was simply not needed, but before I continue to bash it, lets talk about what it did good.  I really liked the idea of seeing where enemies were. For us Final Fantasy lovers, the random encounter system of getting into a fight is annoying and frustrating. You hope that you have just 3-4 squares left to get to the next story part and BOOM a fight. Usually just power mashing 1 button to spam the ""attack"" command and you were done. The reality, lets be real, that was a lot of our RPG experience on Super Nintendo, but we loved it. Anyway, that was a nice addition. The fights were the same old over and over, but showing us enemy encounter locations was nice. There was also no over map. There was but not one that you have full control over navigation. It basically brings you from 1 place to another and its not free running around like we were accustomed too in Final Fantasy 2.  It was crazy easy to get into because of its really simple design, which was nice, and the graphics were not TERRIBLE....though, surely not Final Fantasy 2 (US) level (which came out before this). The game also was not hard at all. I rarely recall ever dying unless I really was not paying attention.

2135,13826,5,False,"09 6, 2006",A1COAX8KHFQHE3,B00004SPW9,David Roth,"Vagrant Story is the kind of game that is either love it or hate it. There really isn't too much in between. It features great characters and one of the greatest stories in any game released to date, but the amount of attention that must be paid to weapons and stats (along with some redundancy in battles) can really turn a lot of people off.  Let me start with a bit of the story. In the game you play the role of Ashley Riot. A man who is entrusted with the duty of being a Riskbreaker (essentially a one man army) who is entrusted to enter the lost city of Lea Monde to try and figure out an assassination plot that he has been framed for. At the start of the game this is all you know. You know that Ashley went to Lea Monde and was never seen again. Three days after he left, they declared him the murderer. Now you have to find out what happened in the city of Lea Monde and uncover the truth. With a supporting cast of characters lead by the wonderfully evil Sidney Lostarrot, Vagrant Story weaves an amazing tale of lost pasts and hidden truths (with some black magic and whatnot thrown in). Be aware though, the story isn't all happy like you will be apt to find in the Final Fantasy series, it goes much deeper into human emotion and psyche.  As for the gameplay, well, this is where it is either won or lost. Essentially the game is a dungeon crawler that has you wandering the dungeons of Lea Monde until you find a neccesary item to continue traversing through. There is a lot of backtracking but luckily half way through you learn a teleport ability that cuts down on that. You can think of it as similar to the backtracking in Resident Evil games for those familiar (find a locked door, need such and such key/item, find item/key elsewhere, go back and proceed).  All the while you will be encountering various monsters of different classes. While it may not seem like much, monster class is critical to how effective you are at the game. You have the ability to craft your own weapons and armor, each one can have special affinities to different classes. Essentially this means you will want a weapon that is effective against each different enemy class. This is where all the in depth stat management comes in (as well as a lot of use of the EQUIP function....). Attacking enemies is done in real time and allows you to pretty much attack indefinately as long as your timing is good for chaining attacks together. On top of that you can target individual body parts on every monster to weaken different stats (legs = movement, head = intelligence, and so on and so forth). By doing this and inflicting enough damage to one body part you can effectively nullify your enemies strength. Although it can be apt to take quite a while.  Graphically, the game is fairly bland even for PS1 standards. It is made almost with a sketch visual, where there are multiple lines to every section of the characters (similar to what you would see in preproduction sketch books). Although it does work extremely well and seems perfectly natural in the twisted reality that is Lea Monde. All scenes are done in the same graphics engine (no CG) and there is no voice acting so all words are said in speech bubbles. Again, odd, but it works.  The game is definately quirky and is definately a bit of a niche game. It is pretty long and requires the player to really get in depth into what they are doing to truly appreciate all the work and the amazing world that has been imbedded into Vagrant Story. If you can do that, it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you can have. If not, then consider your self one of the masses, because that seems to be the general view of the game.",An amazing game that is certainly not for everyone,1157500800,5.0,,,visual player go attack indefinately key/item say cast figure try weapon get riot class happen crawler different armor monster ability happy date entrust really enemy teleport part turn traverse past attack odd let kind city experience proceed target bit almost bland would apt chain familiar work effective hidden release either fantasy special support gameplay sketch go do every may know duty black wonderfully much door view amount character luckily stats plot riskbreaker like emotion graphic section evil encounter dungeon long enter see one depth love role definately make mass perfectly day self line weaken time hate game various top damage sidney general game attention voice see forth human story monster appreciate lostarrot story murderer though battle allow craft pay three lock elsewhere wander uncover magic use head frame work natural extremely speech cg need half twisted think stat reality backtrack enough seem take preproduction mean must go although leave fairly scenes attack movement series lot imbed back redundancy feature truths similar enemy act good consider come game item/key part truth weave strength standard start aware quirky man niche psyche reward continue word lea along critical management body well individual timing effectively final affinity bubble deep find quite way require world function whatnot vagrant inflict thrown declared weapon great multiple amazing real great resident play ashley army intelligence lose engine together truly neccesary monde want equip learn assassination nullify item even book lead graphically never class cut tale seem people essentially dungeon legs pretty

I was extremely disappointed that ubisoft downgraded the graphics last minute, especially with so much hype behind it. I started playing this game expecting a gta clone and nothing more. In reality,  the only real similarities between the two are carjacking, shooting and avoiding cops. The missions play out entirely different,  there are plenty of side missions to keep you busy hours after completion, and the game while not the graphical jewel we were promised, still holds up nicely. The music selection is different than I'm used to but nice, the cars aren't licensed but I didn't even care since they look real enough anyway. The controls are similar to many sandbox games. Hacking different devices brings up random character information for npcs around the city, which can provide humor. The explosions are awesome and hacking into gas lines is fun as it can propel your car or those chasing you high into the air or blow you up entirely.

Weeks,"I have played it through twice at about 90% of the quests completed and it took me both times about 90 hours which seems pretty short for a major RPG game. I didn't have any major crashes but the game suffers from several other problems that still are not fixed by the past couple of fixes they have put in. There are still a couple of quests that are glitched and you cannot complete them. Also there are spots with the sound, people talk and their lips are not synched up or there is no sound at all most notably during Movie Night. There are a lot of side quests but they are mostly go here and get that and are not quality quests. Also some of these quests are to get information from multiple enemy locations which is fine except the locations are not marked and the locations respawn after you destroy them so you don't know which camps you have checked and which you havent. This respawn feature drives me crazy because it respawns so often at one point I got out of the rover cleared the camp walked back to the rover and in that time the camp respawned. Im pretty sure its done to lengthen the game; I finally gave up and just started driving through the camps to get from point A to point B instead of these unending battles. I didn't have any problems with my crew although one of my crew members looks like Mr. Peanut and always makes me laugh when I see him.

I hate 'reviewing' games because it all comes down to personal tastes. Something that I count as a 'con' might actually make the game for fun for some people. This review is only a reflection of how good the game is to ME, many others might have varying opinions.  Pros: -Minigames are great and vary a lot. -Can play local multiplayer even with individuals who don't have the game. -Worlds and characters look and sound great on the 3DS  Cons: -All of the new boards (7 in total) have varying rules and formats- NONE of which are classic mario party styled. Excpect to compete to do things like reach the end of the board first, as opposed to getting the most coins/stars. -No online multiplayer  Overall, the game is not terrible. The minigames are enjoyable and the boards are designed well (visually). However, the boards this time around are far from the classic gameboard in the earlier Mario Party games, which I greatly prefer. Some of the shorter ones can be done in as little as 5 turns, making it so that skill is a very miniscule factor in the outcome of the game. Games are fairly short and not particularily fun when playing against a team of computers.  Well-designed minigames are this game's 'saving grace.' Unfortunately, I expected more.

2173,54521,3,False,"01 27, 2005",A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0001UEHP8,Terry Mesnard,"Hype kills.  I could sum up this game as that two word sentence and be done.  For people who aren't used to RPGs or even action RPGs probably won't have TOO much to gripe about in the game.  If you aren't used to RPGs or action RPGs this might be a good game to start with, especially if you only have the Xbox.  It's easy to get into and it's very light on most RPG aspects.  My brother bought it after playing mine and (until Halo 2) had been playing it non-stop, beating it at least 2 times in the time it took me to get 1/2 way through it.  The reason it took me so long to beat the game was I lost interest.  It was at the 1/2 way point that I started to realize certain things.  My actions, while cool in the changes it had on me, didn't really do anything in the game world.  This is supposed to be a ""sandbox"" world that would react according to me.  And yes, people will run if you're evil or crowd you if you're good but there didn't feel like there was any oomph to their feelings.  They are all nameless, faceless, repeating drones who do and say the same things over and over again.  Peter Molyneux (the creator) had brainstormed publicly all that he hoped to accomplish.  He accomplished not even 1/2 of what he set out to do.  Another complaint I had about the game was how linear it was.  I was expecting an open world (maybe like Morrowind but not as large and overwhelming).  Instead I was given small zones (complete with LONG load times) that had preset paths.  Not once did I feel like I was ""exploring"" the world.  I was being led down predefined paths.  In Morrowind (a game that shares some of Fable's aspirations in design but has it's own set of problems) whenever I found something, I truly felt like I found something no one had seen in years.  In Fable, where everything is laid out for you, I didn't feel that way.  I also wondered where the random events come into play.  One of the things Mr. Molyneux had discussed was how surprised he'd been by some of the events that happened that he wasn't expecting.  Random encounters on the road, little things like that.  The only ""random"" encounter I really saw was escorting a merchant through the forest.  Of course, after completing the mission I come back only to see the same merchant requesting help to do the same thing, same difficulty, same reward.  The tag line for the game is ""For every choice, a consequence."" And that tag line, in my opinion, was never truly attained.  Early in the game, you are given the appearance of consequences, but as it wears on I started realizing that my choices for good or evil didn't matter in the grand scheme of things.  Sure if you're evil you might have a different ending than if you played the good guy; but how many games are out there right now that you can do the same thing?  From the Suffering to Knights of the Old Republic I&II, it's been done.  What I wanted to see is my decision to be evil (or good) truly weigh in on how people reacted to me.  That was the idea behind ""every choice a consequence.""  It never stopped me from doing what I wanted to do; in fact it never made me think twice.  For instance, you could kill out an entire town and the same lifeless bots will return.  It never offers you any real consequences, just port out of town, wait 10 minutes then go back in, everything pretty much forgotten.  Also, Mr. Molyneux had suggested that if you fought guards in town, they would alert guards from nearby towns to fight and you would be a wanted man...what that translates to is wave after wave of guards, nothing more.  It's also a very short, short, short game for an RPG.  Professional reviewers said it was about a 20 hour game if you do everything.  And I tried to make the game last as long as I could and it was only about 12 hours.  That also involved me not using my warp function to get to most places (unless it was a really long hike).  Like stated earlier, if you are looking for a game that gives you good and evil choices, you might as well stick with KOTOR since it will give you double or triple your gameplay.  Sadly, there's not TOO much difference between the good/evil mechanic in the two games.  They both, IMO, provide a shallow look at both sides.  As for what's good in the game.  It's very easy to pick up and play which will appeal to a very broad range of players.  It's quick, doesn't take much brain power and is pretty easy.  The graphics are really well done, the trees and the forests animated very well.  Surprisingly, (with the exception of hornets, I have never seen so many hornets so often) the forests don't have much wild life...though that's probably because of the hornets.  Also, there was some weird clipping issues and graphical defects that happened once in awhile where it would appear that you were running in a HUGE sand pit.  Particle effects are nice, spells are fun to use.  The best feature of the game is seeing what your character will look like.  This is what kept me going until I maxed everything out (which can happen really quickly if you know how to combo).  In fact, I really wish they would implement something like this in a MMORPG.  I haven't seen a character really turn out alike with all of my friends; that's an amazing feat.  I've been pretty harsh on this game in this review.  I guess my biggest problem was it could have been so much more.  I wanted this game to rock, I wanted it to be everything Peter Molyneux said it would be.  I wanted it to be ""the best RPG ever"" (Peter Molyneux).  That said, I do hope they create a second Fable.

Where the first game was light and almost musical in its fluid grace, this latest Persia game is dark, violent, and has throbbing heavy-guitar soundtrack.  The hallmark of the original Prince of Persia game was its amazing motion and graphics. The prince would jump up ledges, run along walls, somersault, and all the while the banners would be blowing in the breeze, a cloak would be fluttering, torches would be flickering. It was really beautiful.  In addition, Prince of Persia had a time system where you could go back or forward in time. This added a really interesting element to puzzles, where you had to figure out if ""backing up"" the time would help you solve the situation.  Skip forward to this current release, Warrior Within. The prince is definitely dark and angry now. The levels are all much darker visually and in emotion. Monsters spew blood. Body parts come ripping off. The prince's moves are angular, angry, full of power. He's still solving puzzles and skipping through time, but it is with a dark stare.  This game is rated M for MATURE and this is very apparent. It's not the whore-slaying modern issues of Grand Theft Auto, but it's definitely violent. It's a game about rage and violence. It's not something to get for the younger tykes.

That being said, if hammering guitar and hoarse yelling isn't your type of music, you might get tired VERY quickly with this.

This type of accuracy persists even at night. I also noticed that when you fire upon one enemy all of a sudden a horde appears from all directions.

Needless to say, I harriedly scooped it up and walked steadfastly to the counter to pay. Got it home, and I was pleasantly surprised with the new direction.  At first, I thought that the ""X"" was roman numeral for 10, thinking that 3 other titles had been released sinceMM6 without me knowing it and then I realized that X is simply the name given to this new MM model. Anyway, enough minutae...this title is solid. X introduces the ability to acquire different armors and varios vital upgrades such as rocket boosts for X's feet, an improved mega buster, and helmet. In fact, some ares in specific stages cannot be accessed unless you are in possession of one of these advanced upgrades. This series also introduces the ability for X to scale walls, a necessary new twist for some areas.  The other major departure from the original series is that your main antagonist is no longer Dr. Wily: this time, it is a sinister ""reploid"" named ""Sigma"", as in, the last letter of the greek alphabet. Also, the robot masters no longer have the ""man"" suffix (ex: Flame Mammoth, Chill Penguin), which is actually cool. The battles are also varied as opposed to the initially predictable battles of years passed: most of the bosses have two different types of attacks that they use (ex: Storm Egale dives from the sky and shoots a horizontal tornado-like wind gust when he is land bound. This game also marks the first appearance of the dynamic ally Zero as well as the new ""ride armor"", which allows X to pilot a headless robot with huge arms and hands allowing him the ability to break stuff and access areas that the normal X couldn't.  Another great addition is the incorporation of heart containers. These containers serve to increase your vitality ever so much (about 4 bars). There are 8 to find in all and locating them only adds to the fun factor and advanced gameplay. There is a secret power up familiar to those of you who are street fighter fans, but...I won't spoil it for you here. It's a secret!  Anyway, just go get this game if you don't already own it.

It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon (if you're old enough to remember them).  The life-sim (home-buying and furnishing) is also watered-down. I didn't feel like it made a big enough impact on the game to warrant its inclusion.  The Bottomline: Don't let the three stars deter you; that's my score for how I felt.

To argue which of the fallout series was best is irrelevant. Its been 10 years now and both are one and the same concept. Play both, enjoy both and marvel in a world that is astonishingly engrossing. A post-nuclear environment, dark, violent, and obscene. It oozes atmosphere. The desolate landscapes, paranoid androids, and the filth and scum in between. There is remarkable insight into the societies at large. Communities that build walls to protect visa approved 'Citizens', ravaged towns filled with junkies, bums, thugs, whores and gangsters, secret brotherhoods and tribal villages, a decaying military faction, slaves, mercenaries.... the list goes on. Riddled within the world, are traces of old and new technology. The Mad Max influences are all there. Salvaged ammunition, restored handguns, modified  equipment, armor, explosives, foods, drugs, alcohol,.... whatever you can find, steal, trade, buy, or kill to survive.  And that is just what lays before you as a distraction. You can just about do anything. The main objective is a deep and character driven story which requires a plethora of other side-quests. So you can quickly see how interactive and time consuming this game will become.  The character himself is riddled with quirks, skills, gifts, and character points. Its a subdivision of the game itself, to deliver and develop a character of  sufficient capabilites that best suit your gameplay. A master thief, quick shooter, charismatic merchant, an incredible hulk, kung fu fighter,  intelligent geek, a porn star (believe it), a tactical sniper, a outdoor scout, a cocaine addicted ""tony montana""... again the list goes on. How you play the game, shapes who you are, and the quirks that are made available to you.  You even have a reputation to keep, whether it is legendary, feared or downright ""wanted"".  The gameplay is unique to this series. It is vaguely similar to the Final Fantasy series, freestyle when you are walking around, but during fights, it changes to a turn based setup. All of a sudden an interface pops up and your character's traits and skills  give rise to a subdivision of options. There are many things to consider, like action points, luck, trademark blows, health, and zoning in (body\head\limb shots)... the list goes on and on. Within this there are quirks that can help even more (e.g. there is a quick draw quirk you may obtain that can allow you to draw first blood in most fights)... you can even close shop and try to run! Also take into account the many many many different weapons available to you from knives, guns, explosives. Boost your stats with some drugs but risk getting addicted (you will have to continue to find and use). There is so much here and the interface makes it so easy to access and utilise all of it.  The graphics are obviously outdated but suprisingly I prefer it to the 3D rendering of todays RPG's. It is based on photo-realism 2d art (think Mortal Kombat 1) that used to be utilised back in the mid 90's. There is an advantage to this... it feels so much more realistic. Just take a look at some of the death animations... gruesome... Even with all the shortcomings of this obsolete 2d technology, I think it brings more life to this post apocalyptic world.  In the thick of it all is the opportunity to meet an array of characters. Some you may allow to join you. Again you will need to manage and provide for these characters. Each with their own personality.... which brings me to my final point about this game. Something some of the RPG games even today  don't have... like Grand Theft Auto. Personality. Playing this game is like reading a book. YOu become heavily invested in the characters. There is so much tongue and cheek humour, so much history (by the time you play fallout 2). Im not talking about storyline, but the characters themselves. Current generation games seem not to go past stereotypical meet and greet characters who are more interested to give you your next objective (checkpoint). Its uncanny how right they got this game. Its unjust how wrong they were to abandon Fallout 3. Interplay went bankrupt and I believe the licence has been given to another software agency to pursue  Fallout 3. I have been waiting for the third one for 10 years now, every once in a while checking the computer games catelogues...

Dark Cloud combines a very Link-like character with dungeon crawl combat, quest solving, and mini games too. The main thrust of the game is that you're trying to rebuild a series of homes destroyed by the Evil Enemy. To do so, you go slogging through nearby dungeons, finding home-bits like beds, lamps and so on, on your adventures. When you bring them back to town, you have to figure out which items to where to please the people. In addition, the houses themselves have to be placed so that the people are happy. Some people want to live near a stream, some want to have morning sun in certain windows, and so on. Your weapons can be customized as you go, and need to be maintained. This gives you a bit of RPG-like control over your life, more in fact than most Zelda games provide to you. In addition, there are some fun mini-games which help break up the dungeon crawling, and give you a bit of variety. The game's provides much longer gameplay time (usually several weeks) than many other PS games on the market, meaning it's a good value for the price.

Yes it had problems but the core for a great game was there and the world was huge. Well pretty much all that remains of the original is the core and it is hardly recognizable. The world is absolutely gigantic. I spent the first twelve hours on the first three islands which are smaller than a few others and they keep you busy by sheer size. Each island has a different culture and architecture scheme from Middle Eastern/Persian to Asian/Japanese to forest island to Old European/typical D&D landscapes. I am amazed at the amount of detail to each city, village and individual building inside and out.  Having split the different worlds between islands was a smart move as it definitely gives a big world feel with a sea dividing the regions rather than having the different cultures packed together on the same land mass. There is music that culturally fits each region.  I cannot comment on the magic unfortunately because I am all warrior:) The main draw to this game is supposed to be its massive magic system and effects. I level up on armor and fighting styles but after I get settled and start to roam this massive world I think I will go hunting to level and try my hand at some magic.  The combat is loads of fun. Alot of weapons. All sorts of colorful and varying armor. Character animations are great. Slight rag doll physic to death blows. Enemy AI is about as good as Oblivion was..but Oblivion is in a class of its own.  Graphics. A new engine has done wonders. Trees, grass, sky, buildings all look incredible. Draw distance is superb. Character animations are good. Lighting and shadows are excellent. A few glitches here and there that I am sure will be complained about but hardly noticeable when taking into account the size of this world and how it can all look this nice.  Voice. Many will find fault here. There is incredible improvement over the last. The guy sounds like Bale in Batman. This is not a story driven RPG ala Dragon Age or Mass Effect. This is an open world RPG and the voice acting is more than sufficient.  I could go on for a while more about how much I really like this game. Easily my favorite RPG to date.

My hands weren't big enough to go around my sister's guitar, and she could play w/o any lessons.  Turn the clock forward just a few years and we have Rocksmith!

I wanted to give it enough time to see if I could really learn how to play using Rocksmith, and I have to say my experience was SO much better than the one on one sessions I had way back when!  Initially there was some frustration when I was getting to know Rocksmith because I was also getting to know the Xbox as well! When I was playing the wrong fret it wouldn't tell me what I was doing wrong, and I didn't know how to get the feedback I needed which led to frustration, so I handed the guitar over to my husband who knows about the Xbox, but now about the guitar. He was able to help me and guide me until I was up on my feet and doing better with both.  After a week I was handling the basics of the guitar well, and within 2 weeks I can say I was handling the guitar with ease. After 55 days I can say I can play the guitar! I'm by no means a genius, but if I keep at it I know I'll continue to improve.

The previous titles had such incredibly rendered versions of historical cities and even opportunities for a bit of education while you play. And while I did enjoy playing them for a time, they got a bit (dare I say it) boring over time. While initially interesting, the missions became too similar. And no matter how historically accurate and interesting the building, climbing up my 30th ancient edifice only to dive into yet another cart of hay from an improbable height and after assassinating my 99th bad guy from the safety of said concealment, I wanted to move on.  Black Flag adds a lot of interesting elements that eliminate the boredom factor. Sailing around the world engaging in naval battles is an entirely new and welcome addition. And if and when this ever becomes a bit dull, there are plenty of cities, towns and jungle settings to explore and, yep, people to assassinate. Combat is much improved as well. While I really enjoy the stealth aspect of the game, it's nice to occasionally attack adversaries head on. In previous games you'd quickly become overwhelmed with more than a few and combat was a bit difficult to master. This game stays true to its swashbuckling pirate nature by allowing you to run into a hoard of enemy sailors and hold your own while waiting for the rest of your crew to come to your aid. But you will become overwhelmed eventually (as you should) but you can choose stealth or a more direct assault as it fits the situation. In addition, there are other entirely new aspects to the game like crafting that actually means something, hunting, and underwater expeditions. And the ocean feels alive! The occasional storm pops up along with devastating water spouts (which incidentally scare the bejeesus out of me :) and tsunamis which are pretty frightening themselves. And the story itself is entertaining and actually seems to go somewhere.  There are a few minuses that don't detract significantly from the game - Examples include the inevitable stalk / listen in on a conversation missions (annoying as all heck) and those times when you get pulled out of the animus back into the real world for a tack-on story that you're absolutely not interested in. (Is it just me that would rather stay in the assassin world and never go back to the real world? Is the entire idea of the animus kind of a pointless complexity? Yeah, maybe it's just me.)

Xbox is bettter than playstation 2 in the controller department. Anyone using the playstation 2 controller is asking for arthritis. Having cheap buttons where triggers are supposed to be the xbox has supreme quality. Having 6 action buttons right at your disposal with your thumb. The analog sticks are much better also. Ps2 sticks feel like a piece a styrofoam carved at shoved in the slot. Talk about cheap. Sony is just in it for the money. Not to mention automatic game saves to the HD and the optional chance to buy a memory card kicks sony's ass in the convinience department. In the library department ps2 may be for you if you like  vast choice. But Xbox does have way more quality games than ps2. Quality>Quantity. You will have much more choices in quality games such as KOTOR, Halo 2, Halo, Ninja Gaiden, Mechassault 1&2, Crimson skies, and much much more. In the durability department xbox takes the lead again. It seems as though ps2 is going to fall apart especially when it makes that loud, rattling noise when it is under heavy loading sequences. and anyone says the ps2 is more portable than xbox than they need to get off their lazy ass and go to the gym. Ps2 is not that much smaller than xbox. Actually, Xbox is more portable since it can actually take a good beating, hazards that will probably happen if you drop your ps2. In summary, you probably can tell which is better Xbox>ps2. It's that simple. Really.  In comparison to the gamecube, gamecube blows ps2 away. Perhaps even more if depending on what kind of gamer you are.  Compared the gamecube it fails in almost every department. Gamecube has unique features that make it way better than the playstation. Ex. gamecube has a unique controller much better than ps2. But it is not great for complex game such as splinter cell(the L trigger has four functions)but can be perfect for games such as metroid prime.

2242,216709,3,False,"04 23, 2013",A2MVPY9XVYST9H,B003S2MXNE,D_Strasse,"The title of this review says it all.  This game really could have been great, but just like the Epic Mickey franchise it suffers from some of the same downfalls in mechanics and weird design decisions.  Here are the pros and the cons as I seem them:  Pros: * Unigue - the game is quirky and unique platformer and not really like much out there.  I appreciate that. * Humor - like the Lego games, this game has an irreverant and silly sense of humor. * Aesthetic - maybe part of the unique bit, I like the whole going from monotone black and white to painting the world full of color. * Fun - when the game works it is quite fun. * Content packed-  main challenges comprise a decent amount of game but the side challenges and wrapping up the levels to completion add at least 50% more game.  Cons: * Camera - not since Epic Mickey have I experienced such a broken and inhibiting camera.  In the later levels when you can actually fall to your death or need to complete a job before the timer runs out, the camera is an absolute killer. * Timer.  Please explain to me the idea of the timer in this game.  The way the timer works is that you start with a set amount of time which is not enough to finish the level and as you do thing you gain bits of time here and there.  Hopefully you finish the level before time runs out.  Thing is a LOT of the game is about exploration and coloring things which you can do AFTER you beat the main challenges in a level.  So in essence you have to skip the exploration focusing solely on immediate goals hoping to beat those in order to turn the timer off completely. All this just so you can lazily go back and color things and set free the little townspeople at your leisure.  Why include the timer at all? It just serves to frustrate and in the case you beat a challenge with just a little time left and it autosaves you're basically screwed and need to restart the entire level.  Terrible.  Summary: This game is a love-hate experience.  There is a lot to love here for those that like unique, colorful and humourous takes on the platforming genre.  It's just that the time mechanic and the camera really starts to aggravate as the game progresses and the challenge of the levels increases.  As a value buy, this might be a worthwhile investigation, especially if the pros are things you like in your games.

The game it reminds me of most is Delta Force: Land Warrior, only with a much better A.I. and the ability to drive vehicles in your missions. My favorite part of Operation Flashpoint though has to be the great A.I. I spent four hours trying to get past the first mission, and never got frustrated doing so. You can get killed easily by being shot only once or twice, which means you will not be running and gunning. You will have to sneak and snipe, lying prone and crawling a lot through bushes and against buildings. You will use all cover available, both man-made and natural. Your enemies are also easy to kill, when you can find them. They are pretty sneaky too and will drop for cover when they spot you. Every time I got killed, I started over and adjusted my plans and tried the mission from a different angle. This game will make you think and be very careful. The tension is unbelievable! And knowing how mortal you are will make you jump out of your skin every time you hear a gunshot. Especially if it's been quiet for a while.  I gave this game five stars, even though it's not perfect, because it has achieved a lot that other five-star games have not been able to. It's the overall sense of being there that got me. The developers used their own custom engine for this, which is both good and bad. On the good side, it renders vast distances and hills like other engines could not, and, being a 'different' engine means it's unpredictable. After playing tons of Quake and Unreal-based games, a person knows the limitations of those engines and what to expect from them. It's nice playing something that feels new, even though it doesn't really look new. The graphics, while good, look sort of dated and the control is just shy of being perfect, but you have to admire the developers for not going the easy road and just licensing someone else's engine. They had specific goals when they built this game, and you can tell they did their damndest to achieve these goals. And in my opinion, they were successful.  I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a long time. Oh, and for reference, I'm running it on a two-year-old Pentium II 450 with 256 megs ram, and an NVidia TNT 1 video card with 16 megs video memory, and it runs pretty smooth at 800 x 600 resolution.

When playing, most of the time I am scared and jumping out of my office chair.  This is a really creepy game!  But once in a while I go through a door and the dreaded ""Loading"" page pops up and I am wondering if I will have to go back to the ""saved games"" area to continue my adventure from there.  To reduce my anxiety I save the game each and every time after a ""Loading"" page brought me back to the game.  It is a pain, to be sure, but this game is worth it.  There was a review here that was griping about saving a game and then the game sending him back to the very beginning of said location(s).  There is a trick to saving the game at an exact moment and place.  Push ""Esc"" and go to the ""Load/Save"" section and delete the previous saved game(make sure the entire page is empty), then save the game you are playing.  Be sure to only have one saved game at a time because this is a seriously annoying glitch in the game frame.  There is one last annoying factor in the game.  It is that using any other spell besides ""Scrye"" is next to impossible because the locations are so incredibly dark that I had to use that spell almost constantly in most areas.  Now for all the positives!  There are great, eerie sound effects that gave me constant chills; and I had to remind myself that this is only a game.  I was backing into corners frequently, rapidly looking left and right for attackers.  You can save the game at any point, which is great, but be sure to remember to ""delete"" the previous saved game before saving the new one.  I laughed at one point because I actually jumped from my chair at a loud crash of lightning.  One area was so dark (be sure to have that ""Scrye"" spell handy), and I was so nervous about being attacked, that when the character's hand moved I thought I was being attacked.  There was one awesome point in the game when I was running down a hallway toward a large mirror when from behind me, rising out of the floor, a demon reached out to attack me from behind!  Ahhhh!  What a fantastic moment!  Oh...you're gonna love the shotgun!  Be sure to save your ""Health Packs,"" and be careful with that dynamite!  If not for the monotony of ""scrying"" everywhere, the rare ""Loading"" crash, and the small nuisance of saving the game so often, this is an extremely satisfying and genuinely scary game.  I kid you not.  If they ever make a sequel without the bugs that inhibit the original from attaining greatness I will seek it out with fervor.  This is an addicting, fun, chilling game.

The pros: -The game looks great for a 360 game. -The production and build quality including dialogue are great.  The Cons: -Terrible control (like all rockstar games) -Getting caught on random plants, trees, rocks. -The beginning of the game throws so many instructions at you that you cant read it and have to end up guessing what to do half the time. -This game is your typical drive ( in this case ride) and map game. -For some reason the developer put the map in the start menu THEN you need to select the map ( which is a huge waste of time and gets super repetitive and annoying.) Like, why didn't they just make SELECT the map button like 99 percent of other games for quick access? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? -Some quests are so easy but the instructions are not specific so you will fail even the basics of tasks, leaving you feel unproductive and unsuccessful at the game. -I am a huge fan of 100% games in acheivments and i can already tell its not ganna be possible. - The combat system is terrible, you will attempt to hide behind a odd shapped rock, and unless you approch it from the perfect angle, you will be exposed and still take damage. - Also like all other types of games like this, if you get to cover with multiple places to take cover, you will have a 10% chance of actually going to the correct location of cover you wanted to go to. For example, if there is a wall infront of you, but a rock to the right that is closer, you will auto take cover to the rock instead of the clear choice of taking cover by the wall, probably cause you were closer to the rock.  I don't know, maybe i just suck at this game, but i have so many video games that i understand more than this one. GTA 5 i didn't like either, nore assassins creed. And i realise all these reasons are small, but rockstar puts out alot of games that take weeks to beat, so these issue repeated for awhile get 1000x more fusterating over time. Maybe its the type of video game. I don't know.  Update 7/9/17 (still 3 stars) - The game is pretty addicting once you get good at it. - The Characters really unfold and expand like they should which i love.  The reason this review is still 3 stars is a reason everyone has bought it or is going to buy it will understand. Undead Nightmare is just unplayable.  It breaks my heart to say this but Undead Nightmare was a big selling point for me and the amount of bugs and constent issues makes it something i have to turn away from.  Issues like: Invisible heads and arms for all humans/zombies Unlimited zombie spawn while clearing graves (deeming it unbeatable) The detector for the amount of zombies killed to save towns freezes, making it impossible to mark new cities on your map. Everytime you save, it WILL freeze at a black screen, forcing you to quit the app and reload it.  If you have patience, go for it. The glitches will momentarily be fix when restarting the app but will 100% come back after 20+ minutes of gameplay.

Being a fan of the previous SOF games I already knew what to expect:  Moving from point A to point B and merrily blowing the crap out of anything that got in my way in an extremely gory fashion.  Games like this have a special place in the gaming library.  Sometimes between deep & cerebral games you may feel like you need a break from all the thinking and puzzle-solving and you just want to blow s#@t up...  and that is where games like this are perfect.  I wouldn't have paid full price for this, but now that the price has dropped to well below platinum hits price it's easy to recommend to anyone who has an appreciation for mindless FPS action.  The game isn't without it's faults.  There's no option to play in fullscreen mode - it's letterbox only - and the in-game messages seem to use a very small font and are almost impossible to read.  I'd have also liked to have the option to re-map some of the controls, but you only have 3 preset layouts to choose from.  The mounted weapons in the game seemed to be way less accurate than the ones you carry and I tended to avoid using them.  Another thing that I didn't care for was that although you get to choose which weapons you start the mission with there didn't seem to be any ammo available to reload them during the missions, so you'll most likely wind up picking up dropped enemy weapons and completing the mission with those.  A lot of people complain that the enemies are very hard to see.  Well, did you expect them to wear blaze orange hunting caps and vests or something? Although the AI isn't on the scale of Halo, I don't think they're quite that stupid.  Basically for the current price, this game is good, brainless fun.

I was hoping I'd be able to play like a classic game with the controller sideways, but instead you have to point the wii mote at the TV screen.  You have to have really steady control for that and it was just a stupid way to go for this game.  Second, I expected that I'd be able to do multiplayer split-screen with my kids or whoever, but on multiplayer you only get one screen and you play together.  Then, there are all the bubbles that are floating past while you're playing and if you hit them they do different things.  Didn't really care about that.  Not that it's a big deal to me because when I was playing I tuned it out and just focused on the bubbles, but there are really annoying graphics moving around in the background.  It's okay as Bust-a-Move, but there are so many annoying things about it.

The reviews I read before buying it failed to mention it.  You can plant crops, raise monsters that you befriend in dungeons, instead of animals. You have about 10 or so posible girlfriends that you can marry, and it overall seems to promise alot.  The problem is that in this game exists something called Runeys. They are spirits, that you must take care of every day. The things is there are 4 types of Runeys, and they eat each other if you leave them alone. If they don't have anything to eat they starve. There are 9 or 8 areas in the game. For every one of the areas that is left without runeys your crops delays one or two extra days per stage of growth to harvest. You could end up growing turnips in 18 days! Turnips usually grow in 4.  The worst part is that the game barely mentions them, but not the consequences or how they work. And if you manage to understand how the runey system works by reading on forums, it is still annoying because you can only manage them by using a harvester, which can catch from 0 to max 5 or 7 runeys at a time. And there are 60x4+240 runeys per area, and it use takes about 5 seconds before you gain control again. And to worsen it even more, when it rains, about 3/4 of the runeys don't appear, so the ones that do, are even more spread out, and you can only catch at most 2 or 3 if you're lucky with each use of the harvester.  You can't ignore them or you can't grow anything. And if you decide to keep tham alive, after hours of learning how they work, you must spend about 12-20 in game hours to manage them...

I find that happening once over 2 or 3 gaming sessions so it's not a major issue. I've only had the whole game shut down during multi player over the past 2 weeks of playing, so again not a major issue. I suppose we expect absolute perfection all of the time in today's media age but considering what this game delivers is pretty amazing in my book.

I play on high settings during 64 player battles very smoothly. For 29 bucks this is definitely worth buying.  UPDATE:  So after updating the game which was required to launch it I am experiencing very poor ping rates on most servers. Many times on clicking a server the ping will randomly change from like 50 to 200. Then when the game finally does launch I am constantly experiencing server lag and hang ups when trying to move around. I used to experience this in battlefield 3 and it drove me nuts and makes the level useless to play when that happens. So much for the 5 stars.

Also vehicles can be abused and the map design itself especially blood gulch can be just a lame game.  A team can just squat on portals and above hills and spawn kill you and portal ambush you. Players will also portal block you which will force you into one of their other ambushes. The map is also not symmetrical and gives advantage to red or top side.

The story ranks up there with the best science fiction and would be particularly appealing to 'Doctor Who' fans.  This game has must-play DLC, and thankfully, it's included in the Complete Edition.  The 'Burial at Sea' DLC completely ties this story into Bioshock 1.  It does not disappoint and should have been part of the original game.  There are two features that add to the FPS experience.  The sky-hook is a lot of fun, and the addition of Elizabeth as your companion was my favorite part. However, the rest of the gameplay gets in the way of the story for me.  At times, it became tedious and a bit of a grind.  I spent way too much time looting and looking for lock picks.  There are parts where you'll get stuck in a fight when all you want to do is advance the story.  If you have a real job and adult responsibilities, forget about the trophies/achievements.  While the trophies/achievements aren't extremely difficult, they are very time consuming.  This game doesn't offer any puzzles other than ""how am I going to kill this handyman with the limited resources available,"" and half the time you can just run to the next door.  This game offers a lot of gear/equipment options, but only 4 can be used at a time, which makes it far less useful than it was in the first Bioshock. Criticism aside, it's a solid yet rudimentary shooter.  It does what it does extremely well.

I received the Gold Edition digital copy of Wildlands with my new Xbox One S. I'm giving this game 4 out of 5 stars. I wanted to give it a full 5, but there is a few minor glitches and issues that ended up affecting my gametime. Mainly due to the physics system and piloting some of the helicopters. Sometimes I will set down the Helicopter on what appears to be completely flat land and I hop out. The game then shows me that there is a small incline and my heli does a backflip while I'm getting out. Throws me up in the air far enough that I die on impact with the ground. Not always bad, the AI can revive you once per fight (They tell you this every time you're on the ground). It becomes a problem when you're raiding a 5 star base, you've been taken down once and now you're extracting an HVT. Sometimes it'll kill the HVT, sometimes it'll just kill you the second time around, forcing a restart of the mission.  The other issue I had a complaint was with the climbing. The game seems to be very selective about what you can climb. If I'm climbing a building, that's no problem. If I'm attempting to scale up a cliff to take out an HVT, sometimes my character isn't allowed to grab a ledge a foot above his head, forcing me to take an alternative route that costs me time and strategy.

If you are in the market for an inexpensive system, this is a good one to buy, as many of the games are readily available at relatively low prices.  If you want a system that will last you many years, and if you have more money to spend, you may want to wait until the next generation of gaming system is released.

Almost all the artist and their songs I do not recognize at all and whats sad is that all the stations are the same with boring music and not so funny jokes. So to be honest when I'm driving the music is always turn off which makes me mad cause I love the soundtracks they usually put in GTA but this time they fail and having it put off while driving sucks.

The cars themselves always kinda look the same as well as drive the same which sucks cause if you want a fast car that's not going to happen and turning in sharp corners is hell making races stupid and not fun at all. I can't tell you  how many times I cuss at the tv and threw my X-box remote on the floor just cause I could not turn my car around the corner and I end up crashing into someone else or end up in the water and repeating the damn mission from the start and take ten to 15 minutes just to drive and get the mission done and pray I don't crash again.    Another thing I hate is the story line its the worst one in the series its makes no sense and is boring as hell, missions are the same shoot, kill and drive which is fine because the shooting system is great and very fun ,the acting is great also, not one bad actor to be found. At the end of the day I stop playing the game all together because of the bad driving the story is boring and music is terrible,I'll finish it but only because of the achievements and that's it do yourself a flavor and skip it.

2328,174148,3,False,"05 28, 2010",A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001E27DLM,Armando N. Roman,"I know this review will be stormed by fanboys patrolling the page to make sure no one gives the game anything less than a 5, and vote 'no' on if this review is HELPFUL or not, which is always weird to check reviews for things you've already played. But this review comes from someone who loved Chrono Trigger when it first came out for the SNES. I had just finished Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy III/VI, and by that time, I was getting into RPGs big time. Chrono Trigger blew me away with its music, characters, time traveling story, and multiple endings. I played the bejesus out of that thing until it got to the point where I could beat the game and get the regular ending in 7 hours. But that was when I was 12. I've grown up since then. Don't take that the wrong way- I'm not saying I'm above it or anything, but these days, it takes more to hold my attention or keep me from rolling my eyes at melodramatic moments. Having played the DS port, I can only say that people who can still play through Chrono Trigger and enjoy it will get a good bargain of this version, and younger gamers (11-15) will probably enjoy it if they like the Final Fantasy series. For those who like deep stories and developed characters, look elsewhere.  Chrono Trigger's plot is easy to summarize at first, but since it has a lot to do with time travel, things get crazy after the first couple of hours. You play as a teenager, Crono, who goes off to the Millennial Fair and literally bumps into a young girl named Marle. She ends up getting teleported to the past after a demonstration of a teleporting machine goes wrong. Crono risks his life and follows her. It's hard to say much more because of all the things that happen and what they lead to, but the story was very interesting for its time, and it went at a good, steady pace without moments of nothing really happening. You'll go back to the past and fight dinosaur-people that are trying to kill all humans, fight a powerful warlock trying to conquer the world by summoning Lavos (a giant creature that can destroy the world pretty quickly), travel to a time when magic was common and those that didn't have the power were reduced to hobo status, and you'll travel to the future where things are very bleak.  One of the things I loved about Chrono Trigger back in the day was its cast of characters, which sadly don't do much for me anymore. Crono is the stereotypical silent hero, Marle is the stereotypical tomboy that doesn't want to live the lifestyle she inherited, Lucca is the default smart one, Frog is a cursed knight/master swordsman, Robo is your standard robot (and borderline emo), and Ayla is the generic 'me strong, me smash stuff' person. There's also another character you can choose to either kill or let join the party near the end of the game, and depending on what you do changes the ending(s) a little or a lot. Again, for younger gamers, these characters will probably be really cool. But after playing something like the Knights of the Old Republic titles and Valkyria Chronicles, the characters here just don't compare. The music is still great though, and I still have my 3 disc soundtrack for the game, and can listen to those tracks anytime.  Gameplay was unique for its time, and still has some cool parts. In combat, you can have two or three characters attack an enemy (or a group if they're positioned right) with double and triple techs. These attacks are usually just plain awesome, and do huge amounts of damage. Like Final Fantasy III/VI before it, you can equip accessories that enhance your abilities in combat like reducing the amount of MP an attack costs, or raising your speed or Critical Hit %. Another thing the game had going for it was the New Game + feature. Once you clear the game, you can start a new slot using the cleared game data. A lot of games use this feature today, but as far as I know, CT started it. Using New Game + is the only way to see all of the different endings, which you can see by going to the final battle at specific points in the game via a special teleporation gate. A lot of the alternate endings are cool, and it's worth going through the game a few times to check them out.  Ok ok, so what does the game have for the DS exclusives? Not a whole lot really. The animated cutscenes from the horrible load time-infested PSone version are back, but a little grainy looking. Character dialogue was changed a bit, and Frog no longer speaks in olde English. A lot of people made a big deal about this, and I can understand why since it made him stand out, but at the same time, he was the ONLY character in his time period to speak it, and in the Japanese version, he talked just like everyone else. There's also a totally new ending that, on one hand is pretty cool, but on the other is so forced to link with Chrono Cross that it's not even funny. Finally, there's a kind of Pokemon-esque monster raising mini-game that's pointless and I'd be surprised if anyone spent more than 10 minutes on it.  When it comes down to it, if you still have your SNES copy, you might as well keep playing it, provided the internal battery's still working. Chrono Trigger DS doesn't bring enough new goodies to the table to make old fans part with their SNES carts. But newcomers to RPGs or those who just want to see what the 16-bit era had to offer will probably get their money's worth, and more, out of this. Again, I'm not going to let nostalgia blind me here.

Strout,"I disagree with most of the negative reviews here that are focused on the controls -- I found the controls to be easy to learn, and flying the dragon is a lot of fun.  What completely ruins this game is the design.  The designers appear to be following the rule, ""do not ever, EVER allow the player to have more than five seconds of fun.""  The missions are dull and linear, often being too hard at the end of 5 minutes of boring flying from place to place, and when you fail one you have to sit there for 30 seconds while it reloads and you have to do it all over again.  But that's not even the worst part.  The worst part is that when you finally do slog through whatever's required of you, and get to a fun part where you're roasting, swiping, and eating enemy soldiers like popcorn and generally having a good time, the level ends!  Aaaagh!  Who the heck are the game designers to tell me I have to stop having fun and start in on one of their boring missions again?!?  I got this game when it first came out, and played through about 10 missions or so before giving up on it.  Recently I decided to give it another try, see if perhaps it would download some update that fixed the worst offenses.  Nope; it still sucks.  Picture any PS3 game that you actually enjoy playing -- InFamous, LEGO Star Wars, Force Unleashed, whatever -- and Lair is pretty much the exact opposite of it.  It's very frustrating, because (in my view) the graphics and game mechanics are lovely and innovative.

2337,42970,3,False,"08 7, 2006",A3VNL4C2HKFUGO,B00008DHNU,Rubin Carver,"I'll start by pointing out that I have not played the other Sonic Advance games, so I don't know how this compares. I do know how it compares to the old Genesis games though, and that is negatively.  But forget that for a second - what are the good parts of this game? For starters, the graphics are pretty sweet. The redesigned character animations are very visually appealing. Sonic rips across the screen in a way more similar to his 3D counterpart than the old 16-bit hedgehog. The sprites have an anime kick to them that is fitting to the modern Sonic persona.  Also, some of the level designs are very nice from both a graphic and gameplay standpoint. Gameplay elements from the 3D platformers have been nicely integreted IE grind rails, and in some places the level designs use these elements quite creatively. The use of anti-gravity on Egg Utopia, while nothing new to the Sonic level vocabulary, manages to maintain a sense of speed and awe throughout. In conjunction with the level designs, some of the badniks are actually fairly clever. I was surprised to find some of their behavior wasn't a simple rehash of the tried and true genesis baddies.  On the subject of level designs, though, the trap designs are hideous (some so badly designed as to be almost 100% unavoidable.) The balance between tricky traps and keeping up the speed of the game completely lacks subtelty. The Sky Canyon stage contains some of the worst use of pitfalls in a platformer I've ever seen. You have to perform some pretty rediculous button wizadry to pass it as Sonic, the only main character without the ability to fly.  Also, while we're on character designs, let's talk about Cream the Rabbit for a second. She's useless. She contains almost no unique gameplay elements and is basically a shorter, less versitile version of Tails. The only truly unique aspect of Cream is the use of Cheese (horrible pun, by the way) who is too slow on the draw to be of any use in a game that puts so much emphasis on speed. Cheese does however make the boss battles obscenely easy.  The boss battles at first are a credit to this game - the running battle gimmick does make some of the fights pretty tricky, and they're certainly more engaging than the fights Sonic Adventure had to offer. However the game relies on the gimmick too much, and by the end of the game I'm pretty sick of it. What happened to boss fights that are all different? That use the environment and circumstance to dictate the gaming style? On a similar note, the final boss battle is horrid. I won't reveal why but it is both far too easy and frustratingly difficult in a way that isn't good.  Even for a game series that gets by on only the faintest hint of a plot, this game's story is nonexistant. The Genesis games used intentional changes in setting, mood-appropriate music and suggestive boss battles to drive an implied story. Your imagination just had to fill in the blanks. Here the story is literally: run to the right, beat Robotnik. It's not a convincing motivator.  I could nitpick a number of other little things, like the grade B techno soundtrack or the ludicrous ""starting line"" at the beginning of every stage, but the main point is that this is a bit of a disappointment for a veteran of the Genesis classics. Yes it has brought speed back to the Sonic series, but it's a shallow sort of speed. It totally lacks the wonder and mystery of the classic games as well as their sense of exploration and discovery. I can remember every step of the old games but most of these levels are simple - and sometimes frustrating - one-way rollercoaster rides. Most of the undeserved criticisms leveled at vintage Sonic can unfortunately be applied here. It's a nice little taste of nostalgia for those of us who miss the hog's career peak, but it's no Sonic 3 & Knuckles.","a return to form? no, but perhaps an improvement..",1154908800,3.0,,,grind horrible taste i've counterpart ever slow shallow actually rollercoaster rabbit rediculous nonexistant useless badly certainly happen hedgehog disappointment cream we're different totally contain ability stage draw keep vocabulary beat right point far frustrating yes mood-appropriate speed genesis step bit platformers almost across version screen imagination frustratingly miss sprite difficult main design run blank obscenely forget knuckle gameplay without credit wizadry criticism they're note every emphasis compare surprise know rid platformer much drive faint button plot level sonic like soundtrack graphic awe level could character vintage nothing modern engage tails element unique unfortunately apply see fight new change point baddie fly sweet animation gimmick pun trap let's first remember game one-way game also intentional talk maintain shorter hideous nostalgia undeserved game's pas style classic story old try though battle run creatively manage second nice nitpick play i'll use bring nicely career convince however true cheese clever robotnik aspect environment wonder veteran graphic less music egg fairly worst little thing behavior grade anti-gravity exploration offer series back suggestive visually sense similar subtelty good adventure set use badniks reveal relies game sky conjunction design part sometimes bos level hog's implied start classic motivator utopia tricky make versitile begin i'm horrid circumstance throughout well get final perform rail fill find quite way rehash lack completely puts redesign sick pitfall kick simple advance ludicrous trap anime discovery starter line appeal place balance persona negatively subject hint mystery truly number unavoidable integreted sort techno peak literally even battle easy basically dictate standpoint canyon ie end fit start pretty rip

Raillard,"Any gamer worth his or her salt will tell you that it doesn't matter what a system's specs are, it's the games that make it.  The Gamecube is a fine machine, but the utter lack of games is what's killing it, and the opposite is true for the Gameboy: hardly cutting edge (even the DS, which I also own), but keep the games rolling and people keep buying.  I confess to being a techno-geek, so I was really impressed by the PSP.  It looks supermodel gorgeous, whereas the DS feels cheap and plasticky by comparison.  Here is my breakdown:  PROS: Beautiful design.  Hey look, an Analog stick, hurrah!  Are you listing Nintendo?  AMAZING graphics.  The screen is enormous.  Ability to play music, view pictures, etc, though to be honest, I couldn't care less.  I have an MP3 player for my tunes and a computer for my files.  Let my PSP play games, and I'll be happy.  Small and efficient storage format.  CONS: Power switch too close to right thumb when playing.  The proprietary UMD disc design is a bit worrisome, as is any non-standard format.  The whole movie aspect of PSP will crash and die within a year, guaranteed.  Why would you buy a movie for this unit when you can get the DVD for cheaper and you can play it in more places?  The unit feels a bit fragile and easy to scratch.  The battery life isn't great, but no surprise there.  That said, all those cons will die out when I can play Grand Theft Auto on my PSP, which should be this summer or fall!  Overall, this is more an adult gamer's machine than a gameboy.  The look, feel and design is sleek, sexy and powerful.  It has the potential to humiliate the Gameboy in terms of power and versatility, though it remains to be seen if that will happen.  Until then, I'm content playing with both my DS and my PSP.","The PSP rocks, let's see how the games are...",1113091200,,,,player fall look gamecube power worrisome listing i'll view storage nintendo guarantee humiliate umd small remains say adult thumb true graphic opposite cut movie powerful disc edge salt fine system's battery unit impressed aspect proprietary get pro within con analog buy great feel amaze feel dvd surprise sleek ability happy less hurrah breakdown music gamer's utter gameboy fragile see really tunes place theft format play psp term tell computer right efficient whole sexy confess beautiful let plasticky gamer worth roll gorgeous cheap machine design lack enormous bit hardly game cheap screen switch scratch would crash what's non-standard hey auto buy etc also close potential honest even matter easy file summer make spec supermodel care play whereas grand i'm stick overall die look though life content comparison people versatility happen year keep kill techno-geek picture

Well, after years of sad attempts to conquer the gang-bangin' leader of controversial video games, GTA now has a worthy competitor, Saint's Row, for the Xbox 360.  Like most stories of this genre, you live in this gang corrupted city named Stillwater. Three major gangs own parts of the city, they're the Vice Kings, West Side Rollerz, and Los Carnales (remember its not THE Los Carnales), and a smaller gang called the 3rd Street Saints (>GASP<). This where you come in. You are later save by the Saints and join them in thier unrelenting quest to take the wor...I mean...city.  Let me break it down for you.  The Good-Full character creation and customization. You can be muscular, good lookin', and have a full set of hair, or fat, ugly, and in serious need of a toupee. Use money you earn to buy 100s of clothes and acceseries (or a facial and hair cut!). Sorry, no bikes, motor cycles, boats, planes or choppers, just cars. But they make it up to you by allowing you to fully chop down any vehical you find and build it to your perspective (if you got the cash). Barely any glitches at all, mabey a few now and them only if you play non-stop for 7 hours (unlike GTA). Terrific graphics, everything has the smallest details from mailboxes to skyscrapers (characters actually have hands and fingers!(Unlike GTA)). Tons of fun and clever side missions to keep you buisy. Online play, create your own online character and compete in many kinds of modes with friends. Regenerating health and ""save anywhere"" function. Store as many cars as you want in your garage. If they get destroyed pay $500 at the machanic and your car is as good as new. Replay missions and cut-scenes in the movie theaters around the city.  The Wack-Character only male semi-mute. Area isn't that big or creative. Not the most original or epic story. The ""gain respect"" system slashes out the realism by using respect to ""purchase"" new story misions. Some side missions can be very frustrating.  All in all Saint's Row is a very good game. If your into the GTA genre and have a 360, get this game NOW.  Pssst, Rockstar.

2364,153791,4,False,"05 20, 2010",AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B0012NAPNQ,Steven Herring,"Just Cause 2 is a giant open world sandbox title. It has great graphics that really add to the enjoyment of playing the game. Anything that you see on the screen you can get to, and with the great draw distance of the game you can see a lot. You use your grappling hook and parachute to climb anything and everything. There are also over 100 vehicles to drive and fly. The one downside to the graphics is the damage on the vehicles. It just doesn't look that realistic. Other than that the graphics are a thing of beauty. The island looks amazing as you travel to snow capped mountains or just run through a field and watch the grass fly through the air with great detail.  The grappling system is amazing and super easy to use. You simply aim at a building, or tree, or well anything you can think of and you get pulled to it with a push of a button. The parachute also works really well and you can use the grapple to pull yourself along while gliding. The gun play system is pretty easy. There is a slight auto aim in the game and it is rather easy to shoot up the enemy forces. I do wish that they would have put different types of weapons in. You have a pistol, assault rifle, and sub-machine gun throughout the entire game. There are no different weapons to really choose from. Even if you had a choice of different machine guns it would have been ok, but you only have the one type of gun. Next time put an M16, Ak 47, among others so that we can choose.  The island is huge and there are a lot of things to see. The only thing is that for every unique location there is a duplicate settlement around the hill. The military bases and settlements are copied over and over again with some slight variations on their design. Also you can't go in any buildings so exploration is really not that fun after awhile. There is for the LOST fans a special easter egg hidden in Panau that is fun to find. I just wish they would have added some interiors or at least more variety in the villages and bases themselves.  The missions are your typical fare. There are side missions and story missions. You have to do the side missions in order to unlock the main quest missions though. The story in both cases is weak. You basically are hired to kill, hijack, or blow someone or something up. The mission locales are varied enough to keep you interested though, as the actual missions are fun and enjoyable to play. There are about 55 missions in total and should last at least 20 hours to complete. The story missions are more enjoyable than the side missions, but unfortunately there are only 7 of them in the game. Don't expect great storytelling as the developers went for a B movie plot instead of an actual in depth one. The voice acting doesn't help as all of these voice actors should never be hired for another role for the rest of their lives. Their broken English is a constant annoyance, and is the main reason that even the story that exists is a bad one as you have to suffer through the terrible audio.  You can call in vehicles and equipment via helicopter. It is similar to the Mercenaries series. You just find an open spot, pull up your pda, and order your equipment. The only complaint I have is that you have to watch the stupid helicopter fly in every time you call him. After you see it a few times you just wish you could automatically skip it.  This is a game that should be experienced by fans of the genre. It is not perfect nor should anyone say it is. The story is lacking and the island itself should be given more thought next time, but it is fun to play. I got over 20 hours of enjoyment out of this game and if you are one of those people who like to one hundred percent a game you will be playing this game forever as there are tons of things to blow up and collect on the island. If you like sandbox open world shooters then I recommend this game, just don't expect the story to blow you away. After all this is a great game to just pick up and play when you're bored.

The initial few hours are very exciting when you explore the world, get into the initial fights, etc.. After the first 10-15 hrs you start to notice you're doing pretty much the same stuff (conquering camps through fighting and blowing up things, clearing scavenging locations, destroying scarecrows and sniper posts) all the time.. After 20+ hrs it's getting tedious. The missions/quests are fairly repetitive and straight forward as well.. you go to place fight some dudes, find artifact/car/something and that's it.. The game is also pretty short if you would decide to follow just the main story.. The fights are interesting initially but as everything else get very repetitive after short time.. you counter and hit, counter and hit, counter and so on and on until everyone is dead.. The only challenging part for me was the race against Stank Gum and I had to reload that part more than few times before I succeeded.. but that would be the only thing.. Worth mentioning are also glitches and bugs that usually involve music and sounds but also sometimes quests.. They usually resolve atfer restarting the game but still are annoying.

You have to deal with:  - Extreme load times, upwards of 2 minutes. - Can't install to hard drive which exacerbates already long loading. - In-game loading drops the frame rate to the point of being unplayable, you have to stand and wait for it to finish for 20-30 seconds. - Numerous game bugs (textures randomly changing or disappearing, audio dropping out entirely, bad hit detection) - Very poor controls that don't resemble the tight, responsive control system in Re4/Re5/ReRev regardless of the configuration. The game was clearly designed for a mouse and keyboard first with the console controls as an afterthought. - Cumbersome aiming: holding any direction while aiming a weapon locks the camera and the direction you are facing, so you have to center the left trigger every single time you shoot.  Capcom did a rush job on porting this to the 360 with little concern about the quality or playability of the result. No patches since the release date have addressed any of these issues. It seems unlikely they'll ever fix it at this point.  About the game itself: For people that liked Resident Evil Revelations, other than sharing some graphical assets this game has nothing to do with that one.

2406,159700,5,False,"11 20, 2011",A24WWT2W1M61AQ,B0016B28WU,Lisa Traverso,"When you look at Call of Duty now a days, you think of a multi million selling franchise that is stale and is hated. However, let's rewind time back to 2007, when Call of Duty 4 was released, and think back to those glorious days in 2007. Call of Duty 4 was and is a fantastic game, with an expertly designed campaign with an intense story and engaging set pieces, while still feeling fairly realistic, and some of the best multiplayer ever in a first person shooter, and Call of Duty 4 was acclaimed as one of the best shooters of all time. I still stand by this opinion today. Call of Duty, after this game was released, either tried too hard or they simply didn't change their formula. However, that doesn't detract from this fantastic game.  Without going too much into detail on the story, the story revolves around the United States Army and the British SAS as you travel around the world playing as two different soldiers trying to hunt down a terrorist who has caused world wide terror. Unlike Call of Duty games before it, the narrative was one campaign, where the paths of the soldiers crossed, and not everyone made it out alive. The story was not only improved because it was connected, but the modern setting made the story not only refreshing, but it was also presented in a gritty and realistic matter. Modern Warfare really nails the gritty feeling of war and the battlefield, and the set pieces are appropriately thrilling, without detracting from the realism of the campaign. The characters were also memorable and likable, and you really cared about what happened to them at the end of the campaign. With all of these components combined, the story in Modern Warfare is fantastic, and the campaign is the best in the series because of it.  Graphically, while Call of Duty 4 doesn't look quite as great as most games on the market, back in the day the technology was revolutionary, and the game still holds up well today in terms of graphics. The textures were great back then, while looking somewhat underwhelming today, but the game still has some awesome effects, the levels in the singleplayer really look realistic and some of the set pieces are gorgeous. Online, the game runs incredibly well at 60 frames per second. The game runs well and there is never a moment where the visuals aren't on par with the rest of the game.  The sound design is also impressive. The voice acting both in singleplayer and multiplayer is excellent, with a sense of realism and likability to the characters to keep you engaged. The sound design of the guns is also fantastic, and you really feel like you are doing some damage with the assortment of assault riffles, sub machine guns, shotguns, snipers, and pistols given to you during the game. The sound of all of the gun shots, explosions, and terrorist shouts give the game a sense of realism, intensity, and urgency that is rarely seen in other shooters. In addition, the original score is fantastic, being memorable and explosive when it needs to be, but also dark and eerie to match the mood set by the game. The sound design is overall fantastic and adds a lot to the game.  Call of Duty 4's gameplay is the best in the series, and is nearly flawless. To start, the mechanics remain similar to the Call of Duty games before: Aiming down your sights with your weapon and auto aiming enemies in the campaign with a fairly linear design and smooth controls. However, Call of Duty 4 was even faster in terms of how the game ran, and this made the battles more intense and made the mechanics even smoother. The controls also feel the most responsive out of any Call of Duty game, making running, going prone, aiming, and throwing back enemy grenades feel smooth and effortless. The campaign action is also much better than in the other games before. The enemy AI and friendly AI are both much better than in the previous games. Your friendly AI actually fights realistically and will save your lives, while the enemies take more flanking positions and perform more tactics to take you down. The AI isn't exactly perfect, as sometimes there are a few dumb terrorists who run at you, but overall they are pretty smart and provide a good challenge. The levels are also expertly designed, giving the player plenty of option in how they want to take down their enemy. In addition, the grit in the story creates some awesome set pieces and intense moments in the campaign, such as a hardcore sniping mission where you need to actually use the wind to judge how you want to shoot your bullet, some helicopter turret scenes, and an eerie mission where you take down enemies from above using an AC-130 gunship. All of these components add to a campaign that is short, but ultimately unforgettable and one of the best in its genre. On top of this, there are multiple difficulty settings which make the game much more challenging from level to level. There are also a couple of dozen of pieces of enemy intel to collect, which give you unlockables such as unlimited ammo in the singleplayer. There is also an option called arcade mode, where you play through the levels of the campaign, racing against the clock to complete objectives as well as getting extra points for double kills, grenade kills, ect. It is quite a nice addition to the game.  The singleplayer in Call of Duty 4 is intense, fun, and unforgettable, but the real star of the game is the incredible online multiplayer. Call of Duty 4's multiplayer is fantastic and revolutionized many shooters today. Call of Duty's smooth mechanics from the campaign transition perfectly over to multiplayer, however the real star of Call of Duty 4 is the ability to customize your load out. In later Call of Duty games, this feature is expanded, with gun ranking, more perks, death streaks, and other components that made the series unbalanced and far too over the top. However, in Call of Duty 4, customization comes in the form of perks, which give your character special abilities such as extra damage, more ammo, and the ability to drop a grenade upon death, gun attachments and camo, and unlocking new weapons. As you play through Call of Duty 4, you rank up and unlock more weapons, attachments, camo, and perks to customize your load out. Perks are special abilities that enhance your character or class, and you can customize them accordingly. You can assign three perks to each class, with three different categories. The first one is for ammo, attachments, or special weapons, the second one is more for your actual combat such as extra dammage or faster reload, and perk three is generally between the first one and the third one, they enhance you in actual combat, but they don't necessarily make you more powerful. These can be steady aim, or dropping a live grenade when you die. The perks work so well because not only do they add a dimension of strategy in your loadouts, and assigning proper perks to proper weapons, but the system is also incredibly balanced, and for every perk there is there is always one to counter it. This makes the game feel very balanced, regardless of your level. The weapons also feel balanced, no one weapon is too powerful or too weak, and depending on the type of player you are, you can use whatever you want and still do good in a match. The balanced gameplay and constant ranking make the multiplayer design not only revolutionary and balanced, but also keeps you addicted and is loads of fun. The game modes are pretty typical for a first person shooter, with your deathmatch, domination, and search and destroy modes you expect from the series, but the addition or hardcore, which causes bullet damage to be much higher and the HUD to go away, and old school, where every weapon and perk is a pick up, add a new dimension to the game modes, and makes them unique and exciting.  Overall, Call of Duty 4 is one of the best shooters on the market. It isn't perfect mind you, the visuals are slightly dated, the campaign is short, and the multiplayer does have some lag. However, these are very small problems compared to how much Call of Duty 4 does right. It's campaign is gritty, exciting, and powerful, while the multiplayer is addicting, balanced, and fun. Add on some seriously awesome sound design and an excellent frame rate, and you have yourself one complete and excellent package. If you are a shooter fan, don't hesitate to buy Call of Duty 4. It is much better than any of the Call of Duty games to come out recently. If you already own Call of Duty 4, do yourself a favor and forget about the new games in the series, and take a trip down memory lane and experience this masterpiece once again.  Final Tally:  Presentation: 9.5/10: The story is gritty, realistic, and awesome. The mood of the game is also awesome, and the multiplayer is fantastic. The short campaign is hardly a complaint.  Graphics: 9/10: While somewhat dated today in terms of the textures, the lighting, character models, animations, and framerate are all excellent.  Sound: 10/10: The sound design makes each battle feel intense and engaging, the voice acting is fantastic and makes you connect to the soldiers, and the original score adds a lot to the overall experience.  Gameplay: 9.5/10: The AI is only slightly off in the campaign, though they are mostly consistant. The set pieces are breathtaking and the campaign is expertly designed. The multiplayer is outstanding and by far one of the best on the market, despite a small amount of lag.

The courses brought over from the original game are themselves greatly improved for tricks, which are now even more important for winning races; some courses, such as Pipedream, are significantly different from before.  The addition of bertricks is extremely interesting, with each character possessing unique bertricks which often defy physics and logic. The main downfall of the game for me is that the new voices used for the characters brought over from SSX are significantly different from before; in some cases, such as with Zoe and JP, this drastically alters the characters' personalities from the first game to the ""sequel.""  This is the main reason I give SSX Tricky a 4 rating and not a 5. But a very significant bonus to the game is the addition of DVD movie material.  Along with a pair of EA Sports Big promos, the disc includes numerous ""making of"" clips, covering aspects from voice acting to the concept to the music to the tricks and beyond.  In fact, this is a good place to start, especially for those who have not played the original SSX, as this provides glimpses of most of the circuits and players, and can help in understanding game strategy.  Also included with the DVD materials is a Jukebox, allowing players to listen to most of the music used in the game. SSX Tricky is certainly worth buying for the PS2 collection.  However, those who have played and loved the original SSX may feel a little let down at the differences in carried-over characters, and may initially feel quite confused at the differences in some of the courses.","Great ""Sequel,"" but Disappointing Changes",1005868800,,,,give case trick significantly play defy personality update quite character bring bertricks extremely love however movie player disc significant character confuse course concept listen important certainly drastically voice big addition buying making unique largely different feel dvd logic glimpse clip provide interesting music strategy little pair include fact ssx zoe physic new original race place bonus let pipedream beyond reason material act good circuit use worth collection alters first version help ea especially difference possess downfall win jukebox game also material jp sport sequel even voice start aspects numerous tricky rating main improve initially often along include carried-over greatly allow may promos cover understand

You play as a an apprentice who is tasked with helping a trio of mad scientists defeat their old compatriot, Baron Mharti, who has run off with their formulas for monster building and is threatening to take over the world with his creations. As you explore the world, you pick up parts with which to make your own monsters. You will learn the tricks of the trade to build parts from three disciplines: mechanical; biological; and alchemical. Parts that can be built are heads, torsos, arms, and legs, and are done in a series of mini-games (12 total for each part and each discipline). Different disciplines have strengths and weaknesses, and different areas of the world are comprised of monsters which dominate in a particular discipline as well (for example, the Neverglades are filled with monsters which are predominantly biological). Combat is turn-based, with monsters taking turns beating on each other. You win by either destroying the torso of your opponent, or knocking off all of their limbs. The story is very interesting, is often amusing, and is of the length that it isn't off-putting or not enough. With hundreds of items to be collected with which to make parts, there are literally a million or more monster combinations, though for later stages of the game you won't be using the wimpy parts you created in the early stages. There is an online component as well, which will allow you to take your monster online, to see how well it matches up against others. For those who have played the Wii version of this game, they'll know what to expect from the NDS version, though the two are dissimilar enough (particularly in the part creation mini-games) to warrant a re-purchase, especially given the low price point of the NDS version.

Now don't get me wrong, I really liked Burnout Paradise and have enjoyed several other games from the Burnout series.  The sloppy physics and lack of realism didn't seem like as big of an issue since the game was mostly focused on crazy stunts like Takedowns and Crash modes.  I considered the game more in the same vein as Twisted Metal, vehicular combat, rather than true racing -- and that was okay.  Burnout Paradise did what it set out to do and it did it very well.  I highly recommend that game.  Then Criterion Games produced Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.  And although a lot of people railed on it for being too radical a departure from the series, it was its own IP and rather than get upset over how un-NFS it was, I viewed it as what it was, Need For Speed: Burnout.  Almost everything about that game from the stage selection on down was copied from Burnout.  It wasn't bad but wasn't the experience I had been hoping for from NFS.  I had loved Shift, I think it was one of the best NFS games ever made, but Shift 2 was a sore disappointment due to a combination of mindless drone AI and the tendency to spin out at the slightest tap from the drones.  After churning out another arcade racer, The Run, I figured the next NFS game would a simulation racer.  You would think they were due for another sim racer now, right?  At the bare minimum I thought it might fall in the middle as the original Most Wanted wasn't pure sim or pure arcade but somewhere in between.  Wrong, what we got was another Burnout.  Need for Speed: Most Wanted should truthfully be called Need For Speed: Burnout 2.  Setting aside the fact that this is absolutely nothing like the first Most Wanted game, frankly I'm just getting sick of playing Burnout.  I'm just tired of the sloppy, unrealistic car movements.  It's a mockery of how real cars handle.  Burnout cars just doesn't feel like cars.  You're controlling these things and they are vehicles and they move around but they're not cars.  Unlike many previous NFS games, you can't choose how realistic you want the cars to handle, like every Burnout game in the past, you're stuck on CARTOON physics.  I really wanted to like this game, the backgrounds look amazing, the graphics look great, but it has as much realism as Mario Kart.  I could be playing this, getting frustrated at why the vehicles can't corner properly, or I could be actually developing real skills playing Gran Turismo, Shift, or another sim.

2455,288802,5,True,"05 24, 2015",A350M315YWHF33,B00BCEK2LA,Kakilefe,"Bought this mouse primarily because I wanted to have a couple extra buttons available when playing computer games.  I did my research, settled on the G400s and have been happy with it for 9 months running now.  While it is marketed as an FPS gaming mouse, this is an easy recommend for anyone based on excellent ergonomics, customization and durability in particular.  Pros: Durability - Buttons rated at 20 million clicks.  At my present rate of use this mouse would last another 50+ years.  There are no signs of mechanical wear whatsoever.  The only hint that the mouse is used at this point is a slight bit of abrasion on the pearl-colored ""G"" logo on the mouse. Ergonomics - Deep thumb groove means mouse is secure in hand and easy to pick up.  Fits natural curve of hand with good button placement and feel. Sensor Accuracy- one of the most accurate sensors on the market.  This likely won't matter to you unless you happen to be a fairly hardcore gamer but is a nice bonus for any user. Software- The mouse is plug and play and the forward/backward buttons are usable out of the box, but the buttons near the scroll wheel need the Logitech software to be mapped.  The Logitech software is slick, light, powerful and quick to install and use.  Be it a game or Microsoft Excel, there is no reason productivity doesn't go up relative to a standard mouse.  On the Fence: Styling- This is a souped-up premium office mouse with gaming innards and a new paint job.  The styling will be hit or miss with most. The office types won't like the gaming paint job and the gamers won't like the fact there are no flashy LEDs.  To both I say, ""function over form."" Cost- You can get all the office functions of this mouse for $30 if you need the buttons but not the ""Zero Delta"" sensor or 1000hz polling rate etc.  As a gaming mouse, it is well-priced compared to its main competition. Textures- The mouse comes with ""hydrophobic surfaces"" which are durable and resist sweaty palms.  They work as advertised and are very durable but many people don't care for the ""all plastic"" feel of the mouse.  The mouse works and it works well.  If you need a rubber or satin feel to your mouse, seek therapy immediately and spring for a different (likely inferior) mouse in the meantime.  Cons: Lack of braided cord- this could/should be standard these days.  Braided is better for looks, sounds (nobody wants a mouse cord that goes ""fwap fwap"" all day) and generally staying out of the way. Scroll Wheel- No issues personally, but the profile is admittedly low, it is simply a smooth rubber wheel with a little bit of cheap wiggle and it appears identical to what is on Logitech's $5-10 mice.  For a $50 product, it seems rather out of place.  That said, it works and this is a rather nit-picky con some wouldn't even notice were it not for the gripes of others.  In summary: impressed overall, particularly with the durability aspect of this mouse.  9 months in and I am beginning to believe it will outlast the USB port concept...",Worth It.

This new control scheme offers another degree of freedom that makes this game fun and precise.  The graphics are great and the controls are fluid and fun but if you don't have gamers hands you may cramp up after dealing with a short pen for a while.  The power of the stylus system is used in many new ways offering a multitude of techniques to attack any situation.

Gone are the annoying tutorials of previous Nintendo games that treat you like an idiot.  This game lets you get into the action right away and you'll be running circles around your areal opponents and unleashing powerful combos, brawling on the ground with combination of sword and gun attacks, and placing series of well-aimed shots on weak-point style bosses. An absolute blast, satisfying and relaxing at the same time.  The development and polish in this game make it well worth the price.  I recommend these accessories (about fifteen dollars) to make playing this game nicer.  A grip and a larger stylus in combination make this game much more playable for long periods of time.

Yes, there is a market out there for gamers like me who like to play FPS games.  Of course, I did get the Wii console to be family-friendly, but there are the after-hour times when I want to let loose and play Resident Evil 4, etc.  Of course, there has not been much in the first-person shooter fare and then The Conduit came out.  What an awesome game!  All of the Wii remote buttons and Nunchuck buttons are utilized to make you jump, run, strafe, change weapons, activate the All-Seeing Eye (a very cool feature that other reviewers cover here), chuck grenades, change grenade types, activate weapon scopes, etc.  My only gripe about The Conduit was that it was SHORT.  But being that the game's duration is by far my only complaint, it's minor to say the least.  The multi-player aspect (up to 12 online) coupled with the ability to use Wii Speak (communicate with your teammates without a headset) if phenomenal and makes up for the short campaign.  Some have complained that there isn't much to the story (and not original at that - alien invasion?), but I didn't feel that it detracted from the experience all that much.  It drops you right into the middle of the action and it never lets up one bit.  It has the qualities for a first-person shooter with the quick hard-hitting action that you might see in a light-gun arcade game.  It's an awesome blend with a music track that will keep you tense.  Some of the story elements were pretty cool especially with aliens using Conduits to bridge their world to ours through walls, etc.  And the hatchery concept was cool as well - you need to destroy them or aliens will keep coming through indefinitely.  While another cool aspect of the game centers around humans being subjected to mind-control, it somewhat falls flat because there aren't any other humans around who are not under control.  Wouldn't it really have ratcheted up the tension to have humans in a room and you're not sure who's ok and who's under mind control until they pull a gun on you?  Unfortunately, you're safe to assume that EVERYONE is a bad guy...so the paranoia route is sadly unexploited.  Despite the shortcomings in story and concept, the action is great and the Wii graphics are well-utilized and it doesn't look like a half-baked job.  Also, the degree of control customization is almost to the PC degree in terms of adjusting how fast you want your character to move at full bore, changing button commands, etc.  FANTASTIC!

2472,196440,3,False,"03 27, 2011",A3620OAYSZTXZ1,B002BS47YE,Tyler,"I found the game quite enjoyable, and it definitely has replayability. The transition from island jungles to the concrete jungle was a worthy iteration in the series. Nonetheless, it has its flaws.  Cryengine 3 is very stable. However, it is important to know that the new engine is not an evolution of Cryengine 2, for those who might have thought otherwise - it has been designed to allow for nearly seamless and uniform performance across all platforms; PC distribution of the first Crysis game fell well short of predictions, primarily because the engine, at the time, required too much processing power for the average consumer to match...people simply couldn't play the game at its full potential. Crysis 2 has been, arguably, dumbed down such that it performs nearly equally on all platforms; essentially, console optimization holds the game back from what it could have been. It is hard to argue in favor of paying $60 for a game that has been consciously dumbed down - in fact, I am insulted that EA would choose to bend to inferior console gaming limitations, rather that establish new benchmarks in gaming technology, as the first Crysis did. This issue is the primary reason for giving the game 3 stars.  There are other notable, but tertiary glitches that should be noted. Clipping problems can be irritating at times - for instance, you might encounter a staircase that you cannot ascend. the AI isn't very impressive, either - on several occasions, you will encounter enemies that will not react to you, or simply spin around in circles like an ice skater. There is some sloppy design work to note, as well: on many occasions, EA chose to use invisible barriers, rather than physical objects, to define the boundaries of maps, which is very distracting. Objects tend to float in space here and there. Also, depending on how you approach a combat situation, you will often encounter the moment and place at which enemy AI will spawn. Howevder, these issues could all easily be remedied via patches.  My final critique is the lack of impressive enemies that had existed in the first Crysis - you won't encounter anything that really has the ""shock and awe"" factor.

Anyone who gives this higher than 2 stars has either: a)never played the pc version, b)played with a USB game controller, or c)only played the console versions (PS2, Gamecube, etc.).  This is a classic example of a console game that was ported by a low-budget Japanese company to the PC in order to bring in more dollars.  There is absolutely no mouse support outside of a 3rd party mouse-hack, which only makes aiming slightly better.  When gamers like myself have to turn to other gamers to make the controls better, it is a pathetic game to start with.  The ""minimum system requirements"" are far to low to even come close to playing the game in the lowest detail/resolution.  Even their recommended system requirements might not be able to play the game in full detail.  The graphics are good but there is no ""wow-effect"" when it comes to textures during normal gameplay.  The cutscenes are poor 640x480 resolution with no lighting effects whatsoever and short vertical white lines randomly in the picture.  Think of a cutscene from a late 90s game to get the idea.  Here comes the worst part of it: the control conversion.  Rather than saying ""Press Shift to dodge this boulder that will kill you"", the game uses the console text: ""Press the 3rd button"".  It took me 10 tries to figure out what ""1 + 3"" was on the keyboard.  To me it would seem easy to re-write the game code to say ""Shift + Enter"" instead of ""1 + 3"".  After 3 months of release delays, I expect much better.  In conclusion, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  ""Obscure"" for $6 is far superior in graphics and gameplay (2 people can play).

You do this by capturing the rockets in midair and then detonating the colored  combinations. You can have up to three combinations, such as; three orange, three blue and three yellows. The more combinations you detonate, the higher your score and the better the fireworks explosions. And that is what is all about. The graphics are colorful. The screen will pan through several backdrops such as a cityscapes, space stations, and other interesting places to put on a fireworks show. The particle effects look cool- they really look like actual fireworks in the sky. The music consists of new age, pop jazz and light rock, which fits into the mood of a show. The sound effects are also good, but simplistic. If you know what fireworks sound like then this is what it is in the game as well. The controls are very easy to learn. You use your analog stick to aim, then the controller buttons to capture and detonate the fireworks, it only takes a few seconds to learn. There is an in-game tutorial  which clearly explains everything if you don't understand the game.  It excels in the ""novalty"" part of fireworks into a playable game, that is easy to get into. Although frantic at times, the game play is still fun. It is also one of the most unique puzzle games available for the PS2 system, but it also happens to be one of the shortest puzzle game for the PS2 (or possibly any system)! It takes me about 45 minutes to finish even in the hardest difficulty. Once you finish, you can replay the fireworks shows you created and view it from multiple camera angles and special effects. You will also unlock a few challange modes, but other than that, the game has very little replay value. Fanatavision is just begging for extra levels.

2497,96141,4,True,"07 21, 2008",A2TK0CUBSBSX0P,B000KMCF0G,Silver Pen,"""Scratches"" is my first horror game and to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if I like it. I hoped I would, but hoping doesn't make things happen. ""Scratches"" takes place in England during three strange days inside an old house. You take on the role of a writer who becomes intrigued with the strange stories surrounding the place. When I first started playing, I was disappointed. I didn't think the game was scary. You were exploring an old house where you found dark accounts in some diaries. I didn't think it was much of a horror game. But now... A little about the house. There are some strange...and downright evil...pictures on the walls (and some more in an old room.) It also began to have a strange atmosphere. Spooky...maybe...but that's not all. Whatever it is, it can be uncomfortable. The first day is a bad start, because nothing really happens and it doesn't give a good first impression of the game; especially if you're looking for something scary. The first night is when you first hear scratching. However, the scratching wasn't emphasized enough in the game. [WARNING! Spoilers ahead!] Inside, the game focuses on an evil mask. A word of warning; near the end of the game, you must make an amulet out of some ingredients found around the manor. I had a problem with this since it seemed sort of like performing witchcraft; so if that's going to bother you, don't buy the game. To finish it, you must make the amulet. The ""scare factor"" depends on what kind of atmosphere you play in. If you're playing in a room with other people during the daytime, the game will have a different effect on you then if you play it alone in a dark house at night. There are a couple surprises in the game that make you jump, and sometimes you're afraid of what might be coming next. It isn't a gross-fest, it's more physiological. If they had added things like doors mysteriously slamming and getting locked in rooms at just the right moments, that might have made the game scarier. By the way, if you're going to buy ""Scratches"" you might want to get the director's cut version. There is a bonus ""short"" called ""The Last Visit"" which explains more of went on in Blackwood Manor. If I hadn't seen ""The Last Visit"" the ending would have been very confusing. And even then, there are unanswered questions. One thing I don't like about most adventure games is trying to find objects to advance. This can be frustrating, and I'll generally go just to a hint site and find the answer. I like more obvious ""puzzles"" like the one in the greenhouse where you have to wash something out of a grate. In this game you didn't have to look for many objects but you had to complete ""puzzles"" that could be a pain, such as trying to figure out how to let down a rope so you could get through a window.

Yes, there are some things in it that are unobvious, but it's a very unique kind of adventure game.

Skyrim itself is very fun and have put several hundred hours into the original game.  The legendary adds all the DLC and allows you to continue leveling by reseting your max skills to re-level.  May sound rather odd, but I like it.  You get a few more perk points and can always keep going.  One big reason why I stopped playing after awhile on the original version - once you max out the talent trees that you use most frequently there wasn't much else to do with your character.  The DLC is all pretty good, with hearthfire just adding some depth to your character, and being able to travel just north of morrowind is great (who else wanted to swim back there??  would be soo awesome!).

2501,380500,3,False,"12 7, 2017",A2GVAZN6XIO3LT,B00NW6T6CC,JB,"Dec. 7th 2017 I probably wouldn't recommend this mouse. To save some people time, the main issue I have with this mouse is that after a month or two of use it stops tracking randomly at any time even in games and you either have to unplug it and plug it back in or wait 5-15 seconds for it to start working again. This appears to be an issue many people have had; I remember seeing reviews about it before I bought it and decided to take the risk. By comparison, I bought a Razer Deathadder Chroma on May 18, 2016 and haven't had any problems yet. My brother also bought a Deathadder Chroma on Oct. 20, 2016 and hasn't had problems yet. Although I love the Deathadder I think I'll be trying the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum to replace this Naga Hex V2 just to get some experience with another well known brand. See below for a detailed comparison/review.  **This review will be mostly a comparison between the Razer Naga Hex V2 and the Razer Deathadder Chroma.** I bought this mouse on July 12, 2017 on sale for $42.89 after tax and it looks like it's on sale for ~$45 now so this might be a good time to review it. I've been using it almost every day with my desktop PC for anywhere from 30 minutes to 6+ hours of constant movement and clicking. This includes simple tasks like spreadsheets, YouTube, Netflix etc. as well as more intense use like MOBA and FPS games. I bought it partially because it was on sale and partially because I needed a mouse for my laptop (I switched my Deathadder Chroma from my desktop to my laptop). I'll start with the positives. This mouse looks great, and since I already had the software installed it was fairly quick to set up. It does of course have more options than the Deathadder, specifically in reference to the side buttons. The Deathadder is limited to 2 side buttons which I use to adjust DPI on the fly and I believe that's the default setting , but they can be changed. The Naga Hex V2 however puts these buttons behind the scroll wheel and adds an additional 7 side buttons that can be programmed to pretty much any combination of keys you can think of, I also like having a place to rest my thumb in the middle of the buttons. Both the Deathadder and the Naga Hex V2 allow you to change the colors.  Ok now for a few negatives (sort of). The first major difference I noticed when switching from the Deathadder to the Naga Hex V2 was that this mouse tends to promote more of a palm grip while the Deathadder seems to be better suited for a finger/claw grip. This made the Naga feel odd at first but I got used to it and it's perfectly comfortable even though my hands are fairly small for a guy; so in the end no issue there. The second problem I had was the organization of the 7 side buttons; looking at the side of the mouse directly, the keys go in order of 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5, 4 clockwise. Personally I found this made it harder to get used to the buttons but then again I've never been a big user of programmable mouse buttons so maybe more experienced users won't have a problem. Another thing I realized is that I prefer the DPI quick switching to be on the side for easier access so if you want that you'll have to program 2 of the side keys to do it. Oddly enough accidentally pressing the DPI buttons seems to happen to me the same amount regardless of whether I use the Naga or the Deathadder, but it's rare in both cases. These issues are negligible and I'd probably give this mouse 4 stars at the ~$80 or 5 stars at the ~$45 price if it wasn't for the tracking issue I mentioned at the start of this review.

If you are fraction of a second late on some tricks, you will find yourself crashing just like that.  Another annoyance occurs when you step out of bounds.  If you do that, you automatically crash, which makes you lose a lot of ground.  So while the point of the game is to make crazy tricks that earn you boost, I honestly think that if you drive careful and do not crash, you have a good chance of winning, which makes the whole point of tricks a tad dubious.

Here's some background of my setup:  I have a 55"" LG Oled tv (Oled55E6P) which is a 4K tv with Support of both HDR formats which are HDR10 (supported by Xbox One S) as well as Dolby Vision (not supported but my favorite of the two).  With this set up, the Xbox will be able to  (after a day one update) display in 4K resolution upscaled, or you can leave it at the native 1080P and have your TV handle the processing on its end.  Apps that support the new resolution like Netflix look stunning, you will have to upgrade your netflix to the 4K plan (11.99 a month) but it's worth it in my opinion.  Another big plus for me is the built in 4K blu ray player!  I have to criticize MS for not explaining the features about this xbox at E3 because I don't think people are aware that this xbox has that.  The only other 4k blu ray player is the samsung for around 319 dollars which is not great if you look at the reviews.  It's a no brainer to go with a system that plays games and has a 4K player.  I purchased two 4K HDR movies Batman V. Superman and Mad Max and let me tell you the HDR10 makes everything pop.  I can never go back to 1080P after seeing this.  Now on to the most important question.  Should you buy this if you don't have a 4K screen?  Here's what I'll say, the processor is different because it is definitely faster navigating through the system but that would be the only upgrade on this machine, aside from the smaller size of course.  I would not recommend upgrading unless you plan on getting a 4k screen in the near future.  Maybe wait for the scorpio.  One thing I'm not happy about is the exclusion of Dolby Vision.  Yes friends there is a new format war, the last one was Blu-ray v. HD-dvd and now it is HDR 10 versus Dolby vision.  HDR10 is the industry standard and is free for any manufacturer to use (and it looks great on the screen) and offers a static HDR image. Dolby Vision is a proprietary version of HDR (much better in my opinion) which offers HDR in a dynamic way.  Manufacturers like Sony/Samsung etc do not want to pay the licencing fee so they are sticking to their guns on that.  Currently LG and Vizio P/M series support both and will future proof their system so the customer doesn't lose.  Xbox One S supports HDR10 and will never support DV due to it being a hardware change not a simple software update.  Just thought everyone should know.",A must buy if you own a 4K HDTV!

Then have them skate in eight detailed skate parks (several more hidden!). The price of this game is so low (because it is dated), and the graphics are a huge step up from the Playstation and N64 versions, such as very detailed textures and even graffiti looks great. The X-Box version of this game does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. This game came out after Tony Hawk 3 had come out, and could have included several upgrades from the superior Tony Hawk 3 game. The makers of the game did not use the X-Box to its full capability, such as having limitless saves for replays, created skaters and created skate parks. There are no custom soundtracks either, which is a huge let down with the X-Box's hard drive able of keeping music on it. The game really needs to be divided into three parts, the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 part, that has eight courses to skate on where for each course, there are a number of goals to accomplish for each, such getting high scores by earning points from performing tricks, grinds, and jumps over gaps (like building to building), collecting the letters SKATE, grinding three rails, jumping over fire hydrants and various other things, they vary from level to level. When you complete a goal you get money to gain cash that you can buy new skateboards, upgrades to better your skater and you can also buy bigger tricks.  The second part comes after you complete the Tony Hawk 2 game, then it unlocks a new career, the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2X, which consists of five ALL NEW courses exclusively for the X-Box. The levels are a nigh club in London, a construction site in Texas, a skate park in Tampa Bay (the skate park is also in Tony Hawk's Underground), and two fictional areas, the subway and a skatepark with large grinds. There are new goals to do, but you do not get money for completing these goals. These courses are very lack luster and look more like they were rejected from Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, which brings us to the third part of the game.

2514,375394,5,False,"08 26, 2015",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00MV7KVP4,Bella,"The state of modern slasher movies is pretty saddening. In the 80's, 90's, and even early 2000's, these dominated the horror film market, giving viewers increasingly absurd and implausible situations to watch teenagers get hacked to bits over. That's an oversimplification, of course. There were dozens of genuinely good movies that took the formula and twisted it around in fun ways. ""April Fool's Day,"" for example, or ""Sleepaway Camp,"" ""Scream,"" and maybe even every ""Friday The 13th"" after the sixth one. The point I'm making is, this is a genre in need of some love. All we get now are the same ghost stories, the same ""found footage"" flicks, ad nauseum. The only thing in recent years that's truly impressed me was the gleefully chaotic ""Unfriended,"" and that wasn't even a ""proper"" slasher flick. So, with Supermassive Game's much-hyped ""Until Dawn"" presenting itself as a sort of interactive slasher movie, I got pretty giddy with excitement. But is it another ""Night Trap,"" the deservedly ill-fated Sega CD ""game""? Or is this finally the resurgence I've been waiting for?  The answer is ""sort of kind of,"" but don't let that sound like a knock against the quality of this riveting little thrill ride of a game. Because, up through the very last moment, ""Until Dawn"" delivers not only more scares, more twists, and more ridiculous gore than most modern horror films, but manages to hearken back to the PS2 glory days of survival horror while it's at it. It's the best of modern and classic horror films, while still managing to be a surprisingly proficient game in its own right. Oh, and did I mention that it's horrifying? Because it really is.  Truthfully, the set-up is perhaps the most benign and predictable out there, at least as far as these sorts of affairs go. Some teenagers go to a remote ski lodge one year after two of their friends bit the dust, trying to rekindle the flames of their friendship. Of course, most of them are also trying to get laid, because this is a horror joint and of course they are. Sadly, not one, but two masked maniacs are there to try and put a damper on their fun, to the tune of flamethrowers, ""Saw""-style death chambers, and trained wolves. Also, ghosts, Also, ambiguously cannibalistic monsters. Also, ancient Native American spirits. Yep.  The thing about ""Until Dawn"" is that none of it makes any sense until about 3/4 of the way through the game, and believe it or not, that actually works to its advantage. Instead of being content to scare players with one consistent threat, there are numerous forces to contend with, and none of them feel like they have any connection with each other. What does a ghost have to do with a perverted man in a clown mask, or a flamethrowing maniac with malevolent mountain creatures? More than you might think, actually, and that's where the true strength of ""Until Dawn""'s narrative comes to the forefront.  In 2012, ""Cabin in the Woods"" took every horror movie trope imaginable and mashed them together, then gave the most cop-out and ludicrous reason why they were all there. Of course, that's a great movie, but it went really far with the absurd comedy. ""Until Dawn"" does the polar opposite. It takes every horror trope imaginable, then gives a completely plausible and compelling reason why, exactly, all of them decided to converge on this particular night and assail this particular set of teens. The late-game twists aren't actually funny... at least, not intentionally. Everything feels very sincere and authentic in its attempts to weave a yarn, and that's something I admire. It's not cheap. It's not a satire. It's horror, through and through, until the very end.  That counts double for the gameplay as well, which is a glorious and satisfying return to older survival horror games. Cantered camera angles, slow controls, selective lighting... it's all here, recreated in loving detail by a developer who obviously cares about the genre. Even the best new horror titles either take a first-person view (""Alien: Isolation,"" ""P.T.,"" ) or an over-the-shoulder view (""Dead Space,"" ""The Evil Within,"") when it comes to guiding the player. Not ""Until Dawn."" The camera is perpetually at a fixed angle, bringing to mind the vintage ""Silent Hill"" or ""Resident Evil"" titles. However, because this is 2015, the controls are more responsive, more smooth, when it comes to directing characters to their potential demise. It takes an aspect about older horror games that I positively adore, them modernizes it in a way that I had previously thought to be impossible.  But where the gameplay diverges a bit is in the combat. Namely, there isn't really any, outside of some context-sensitive events, which play out very much like a game helmed by David Cage. However, this is Cage gameplay in the hands of a developer who actually knows what they're doing, so the result is a game that doesn't feel like an interactive movie. In PS2-era survival horror games, confronting the threats at hand would lead into bouts of janky combat that sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. I have a soft spot for that gameplay, but it just doesn't hold up in this day and age. ""Until Dawn"" takes the survival horror mold, rips out the combat, and replaces it with quick-time event segments. Now, I really hate modern gaming's reliance on QTEs, as I usually feel like it's just an excuse for lazy game design, but in the case of this game, it actually works. They're not abused, and when they're used, it feels urgent and tense. And, most importantly, you usually see immediate consequences for failing them. Characters will lose items, get hurt, and sometimes straight-up die if you miss prompts. In most games, players will just see a slight riff on the same basic flow of events. In ""Until Dawn,"" the central gimmick of ""you control who lives and dies"" ends up feeling like a fulfilled (and tense) promise as opposed to marketing hype-speak.  That could be said of this whole package. Everything about the way ""Until Dawn"" has been marketed made me think I'd despise it. ""It's an interactive slasher movie,"" they said. ""It has cutting edge visuals and well-known actors,"" they said. ""It'll make you scream out loud,"" they said. I scoffed at all of this, but I was proven wrong. This game is a subversive and truly disturbing take on slasher films, and takes some totally out-of-left-field twists near the end that made me cackle at their absurdity. It has some truly gorgeous visuals, perhaps the best on the PS4, aided by a haunting and masterful art direction and some stellar performances from Panettiere, Rami Malek, and, most importantly, the inimitable Peter Stormare. And, all tied together with tense gameplay that blends old-school progression and new-school action, the result is a tense, terrifying experience that made me actually cover my eyes and scream out loud more times than I'd like to admit.  ""Until Dawn"" was something that I went in expecting to hate every hour it dragged on, but instead, I found myself hanging on every second, even through the ending credits. The scares feel very real and palpable. The threat of permanent death is around every corner. The plot keeps you guessing even after the game wraps up. Simply put, Supermassive has taken my favorite type of interactive horror experience and modernized it, crafting something that genuinely scares and feels like it has a lot of love put into it. Aided by a great deal of replay value, the whole package feels like the rare AAA, ""cinematic"" game that never loses sight of being a game, and the result of that is the scariest game that will probably come out this year, maybe even within a few years.  Slasher movies may be past their heyday, but if ""Until Dawn"" is any indication, enough people still care to keep doing novel, clever, and, most importantly, scary takes on them. Only, this time, we got a stellar horror game instead of another movie. And truth be told? I'll take it.  Pros:  - A twisty and absurd story that shocks through the ending. - Loads of replay value that's organized in a steamlined way. - Tense gameplay that feels interactive and not passive. - A great throwback to older titles with some fresh twists. - Beautiful visuals that render an excellent art direction.  Cons:  - The early hours are deceptively simple. - Absurd late-game twists might not impress everyone.

This is my first experience with a mechanical keyboard other than messing ones on display in stores and after messing with the keys on a display model I decided to buy this and I am very happy with my decision. First off I am used to the plain old $25 membrane keyboard that you can go pick up at Walmart and use with ease but after using this, it will be hard to go back. Yes it is that good.  Pros: For the pros I am looking at the over all performance of the keyboard and aesthetics. I like how the keys feel when pressed. Again since I am used to membrane it I used to mashing the keys all the way to the bottom but with this I do not have to as I hear a pleasing click with each key press(my sister says it sounds smarter an more professional). Next is the LED's. I have read a lot of reviews that say the LED's can go bad and I hope that does not happen but form what I am seeing they are phenomenal and I love how I can change the brightness and the gaming setting that only lights up numbers 1-6 and the WASD keys. Since I am a gamer that is very helpful. The next thing on my list of pro's are the multimedia function keys, they are better than my previous keyboard that even though it did have them, they were nowhere near as decent feeling as these. Now onto the construction of the board. It is made from aluminum and weighs slightly less than my laptop (6.1 lbs). It feels very sturdy unlike a Razer keyboard I used to own and the added palm rest is very natural feeling and comfortable.  Cons: Honestly I can't think of any at the moment, Corsair is a such a trustworthy brand that I trust it will have very few issues.  Other: A few things that should be noted about this product are as follows: The palm rest while comfortable, is made of plastic. It feels very durable but other than that I am not sure about how long it will last but I will update this review if and when needed. The next thing to be aware of is the USB dongle that powers it. Unlike most keyboards that I am familiar with this one needs two USB ports to operate it, not one. So be prepared to give up an extra port for an awesome product.  With this I leave the rest up to the purchasers who might read this review and the countless others and decide on their own which keyboard to buy(this one). I will recommend this to any professional writer or anyone that games.",Best Keyboard I Have Ever Owned,1409184000,,"{'Size:': ' Standard', 'Color:': ' Black'}",,feel give dongle note hard plastic honeslty use ease keyboard performance onto trustworthy natural way pro's like buy(this decision model extra recommend nowhere near mash might press(my product think one multimedia function others professional next last can't prepare pro mess sturdy thing anyone con countless pick change sure slightly feels already feel palm sister store well happy long less read aesthetic unlike lbs brand hope thing one love lot need back operate make usb number razer added yes smart sound good gamer set durable port use comfortable list first membrane trust update game light honestly display walmart decide game power hear issue buy familiar bad writer key decent laptop wasd even port aluminum leave form press bottom rest aware plain brightness click experience key say led's need reviews construction moment since helpful two awesome keyboard old okay previous though follow board purchaser weigh happen go use decide say mechanical see phenomenal please look corsair review

Now I do believe having played the first three is important to understanding how great the game is, however this action/adventure games leaves a lot to love.  First off, the story is a true work of art giving time for the narrative back-and-forth that happens when Nate and other are just exploring the world. The characters evoke emotion and keep you curious of who may or may not come out on top. The graphics themselves make you stop and stare when playing on a good looking tv. Everything from the character models to the landscapes have an attention to detail that Naughty Dog always brings.

This is an RPG/Adventure game (paper mario-ish) and not a platformer like super mario bros/super mario 3D land. Includes leveling up characters, buying equipment, battling monsters. This is my first in the Mario RPG series so all the tutorials were very helpful. The battles in this game can be difficult, even early on. Like all Mario games, there's no voice acting so I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who doesn't like a lot of text reading and RPG's. Though the text is pretty humorous which makes reading it not such a hassle.  For those familiar with RPG's there's not a whole ton of grinding from what I've experienced but leveling up takes some time so I'd advice you to fight almost every monster you encounter.  It's not a steep learning curve but the battles do take some practicing before you'll be able to get the most out of your attacks.

2566,147489,5,False,"10 2, 2010",A27G9LMQTMND03,B000ZJVDA2,Patrick_91,"In Lost Odyssey (LO) you start out as a man named Kaim Argonar, Kaim is very special in that he is an immortal who has lived for 1000 years, unfortunately for Kaim he has amnesia. Through a series of events Kaim meet other immortals who have also lost their memories, it's through the help of these immortals, as well as some mortals that Kaim goes on a quest to regain his memories as well as the memories of the other immortals and ultimately save the world he has come to live in for 1000 years. All throughout your quest the main story of LO is supplemented with 'Dream Sequences' What these are is basically Kaim remembering things that have happened to him over the years. The dreams were very well written and I actually enjoyed reading them, but that's all you did was read, there were no cut scenes depicting these dreams (which would have been awesome) or anything else done with the dreams to make them more interesting. However some dreams were emotionally moving and most of them actually showed you the pain of living for 1000 years....  And herein the problem lies, the dreams are actually better than the main story of the game, now don't get me wrong, the story in LO is good, but that's all it ever is, it never does anything to become great. And the dreams in LO are GREAT, if only they would have done more with them I could quit gaming knowing I had played the perfect JRPG. Anyways moving on, gameplay in LO is old school, its straight from the 90's. That's right I'm talking turn based battles, LO does little to try and change up this 20+ year old formula and for the most part I didn't mind, people who have played any Final Fantasy before 11+ will feel right at home, battles are all random and at first it was refreshing to see this come back in an RPG however by the time I was on the fourth (and final) disc of LO I was so freaking sick of random encounters I stopped fully exploring dungeons, random encounters were fun in the 90's, heck they were still fun in 2001 but fast forward to 2010 and now there just plain boring and completely unnecessary. I will say it again though that the random encounters started grating on my nerves on the 4th disc/ 30 hours into the game, by this time I was antsy to finish the game and that could explain my temporary hatred for random encounters :p.  However after all is said and done LO is easily the best RPG available on the 360, the ending scenes of the game are great, dare I say even better than the dreams? It closes up all the loop holes and even has a very surprising plot twist (not to spoil anything but there is a certain member on your team who becomes the unlikely hero of the game.)

2583,39449,5,False,"04 5, 2005",A2K25U9K4U7EQ6,B00006LEM8,Bokan,"This WA is by far an excellent addition to anyone's RPG drawer. Unlike SOME people's bland analyses, this WA is unique in many ways in comparison to its previous cousins.  First of all, the story will feel familiar to those of you who played the first WA. A lot of references and names are used in conjunction with this one (including two big surprises in the middle I won't spoil for anyone yet to play this game) and make this game more engrossing. Second, the main character of this game is the first female protagonist for the Wild Arms series and she does a good job of playing the courageous heroine. While she's no Lenneth Valkyrie or Elly Van Houten, Virginia Maxwell performs well fighting injustice throughout Filgaia. To make it more interesting, she is the only female member of the team and the leader of a party that composes males. How's that for girl power? Third, if you loved the ARMS in the last two games, you'll be surprised to know that in this WA, ARMS are your regular weapons and that they are the main weapon of just about everyone you come across in the story. This brings on a feeling of classic wild west since cowboys and cowgirls relied on the same trusty pistols.  Now, for the gameplay stats:  Story-This WA's story is a tad on the huge side, so you must pay careful attention to details as they come. Of course, if you remember any info from the first WA, this won't be a problem for you. Most of the story's content centers around a lot of scientific detail and terms though, so be prepared for complex explanations.  Characters-Your party will compose the same four people for the entire game and each of them develops quite nicely as the story rolls along. In fact, each character has a tough dungeon later on that exclusively stars him/her as the central figure for the plot and helps explain some things that may have confused you before (a.k.a plot fillers, but by no means boring ones).  Music-Michiko Naruke, what a genius! She knows her wild west music. Reading everyone's other comments, I'm appalled by your rudeness and lack of musical comprehension. These are some of Naruke's best pieces to date. The use of strings, whistles and drums blend into some nice wild west themes, especially the many town and battle themes. Don't forget that there are also the traditional dark, sad, heroic, goofy and serious themes.  Battle System-This WA keeps the tradition of Force Points but now has a newer simplified setup. Each character has one unique Force move (ex: Virginia uses Mystic) and two that they all share, Gatling and Summon. Also, a new feature lets you turn monsters into magic gems when defeated by an elemental guardian summon or spell. The gems can be sold for quick money (which is scarce) or used to cast the same elemental spell that made it. Your ARMS can be upgraded and there are countless setups to have for each ally and while quite expensive, can improve your odds against tougher monsters. Each character's gun is unique in its stats, so you must consider carefully what parameters to build (especially since you can reset them but you don't get your money back). Guardians play a bigger role than before. There are 12 in all and each character can equip three. Each one ups certain parameters and gives the equipper four spells to use (sorry folks, no Crest magic in this WA). There are once again, endless setups, but certain Guardians work best with certain characters.  Sound-Magic spells, guns, explosions, horseriding and monster noises all in one game? Quite a coloful bunch of sound FX if you ask me. The gun sounds are especially on the mark.  I give this Wild Arms a 5/5. Buy it and enjoy, it rocks! And for those of you who want an extra challenge, the Abyss is back from WA1, but it's now 100 floors and a familiar face awaits at the end.

Using an infrared blaster and this, I can easily pause, play, change channels, and really do anything else that the xbox controllers can within the menu area of the XBox One. The remote automatically calls the commands that the XBox sends out via the infrared blaster to change the channel on cable box. This worked out of the box without any setup. I could not get the volume function to work. I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the remote, the Xbox, or my receiver.  The remote feels good in my hands. There are some reviews stating that it feels light or cheap feeling. I honestly disagree with this assessment. It does not feel cheap to me at all, but rather (apart from the volume issue) does exactly what I would want it to do.

2602,166487,4,False,"01 23, 2010",A334NLCEG35HL8,B001AH8YSW,Blejowski,"Although it's not without its flaws, this is a great game. And as a debut, it's sensational - I'll definitely be keeping an eager eye out for whatever CDProjekt do next. I found The Witcher to be an engrossing, atmospheric and fairly deep game experience.  There are many things to praise about this game. The graphics are very nice, the environments feel rich and varied, and the characters and enemies are well made. The music is first-class: rich, moody, and dramatic without being too cheesy; I've seen many a Hollywood blockbuster without music this good. The voice acting is superb (though I played it in Polish - the little bit of English dialogue I've listened to didn't sound as interesting and well-delivered as the Polish does). For the most part the characters felt real, each with their own biases and foibles, and when they speak they feel like real people (again, I can only speak for the Polish-language version here), which is refreshing in a genre that often reaches for cliches or black-and-white portrayals. And only the Poles would make a game where getting drunk is a major part of the gameplay! The story is intruiging, and relatively complex too, although it sometimes rushes forward a bit too quickly for it to feel totally natural, and I felt at the end that too much was left unexplained or unexplored.  I liked the combat system quite a lot. I felt it captured a good blend of action and tactics: your stats and level-up choices always feel important, but so do your reflexes and your need to think on your toes. Most the time, you can't just click away thoughtlessly and let your stats do all the work for you, nor can you charge in and use your reflexes to win fights that Geralt shouldn't rightfully win. Many fights require you to plan ahead, using the alchemy potions. This was one of my favourite parts of the game, and felt quite tactical, as several of the potions significantly change the way the combat works, looks, and feels. Overall, the difficulty of the game was good. On the hardest settings, I felt frequently challenged but never hopelessly outclassed. Towards the end though, some of the spells get too powerful in my opinion, and the fighting gets a little too easy.  There are imperfections too. My greatest complaint is that the character models get reused waaaay too often. Even relatively major characters use duplicated models. This really strains the immersion of the game, and makes it feel a bit undercooked.  Secondly, I wish the game world felt a little bit bigger. There is plenty to do and see in The Witcher, and the game certainly feels satisfyingly long and epic, but you still feel fenced in a little most of the time, especially when you compare it to a game like Oblivion, which feels much more non-linear and vast. The fact that the enhanced edition comes with a giant map doesn't help either. The land covered on the map is huge, and includes many diverse regions and multiple cities, though in the game you only ever get to visit about 5% of the area on that map.  The 'love-card' system was an unfortunate addition too. Geralt seemingly can have sex with just about every female character he meets, and once he does, he gets a titillating illustration of that character, like a sort of belt notch. This feels ok for the women he can aquire a romantic relationship with, but when he starts to bed women he's known for 2 minutes and who didn't even seem to like him, it begins to feel like a parody of a 70s porno plotline. It's a shame, because there are female characters in the game who are intelligent and complex, and all of this just adds an element of sexism and immaturity to what is otherwise a mature and intelligent story. Also, there should be more women in the game in general, as the great majority of the characters are male. Sure, the story is set in a violent, medieval-esque world, so I expect it to be somewhat male-dominated, but more female characters would have made the story even more interesting.  I played this on a pretty good system with Windows 7 64bit installed. The game only crashed a few times during the whole playthrough, which I consider acceptable, and the loading times felt pretty short. I had an issue with the copy protection upon installation (despite having a legal copy), but the latest patch removes that copy protection system, so problem solved.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this.

2609,266673,5,False,"04 6, 2014",A1P44MUZ2196WY,B006YDPU48,Justin B.,"Anyone who knows me knows how much I love the Souls games.  My review of the original Dark Souls was a ranting, sprawling mess so I'm going to try to keep this one as short as possible.  This is an extremely impressive addition to the already incredible Souls series.  When Dark Souls II was initially announced to be in development there were a lot of concerns that the game would be dumbed down and less difficult.  These fears were only further enhanced when it was announced that the original director of the Souls games, Hidetaka Miyazaki, would be stepping down.  I am pleased to say that this is not the case at all.  In fact, if anything this game may be harder than the original Dark Souls at some points.  Some of the bosses are downright brutal and the enemy AI has been improved significantly.  The combat also seems much weightier but all and all this game plays and feels just like its predecessor.  It still has the wonderful level design, dark and brooding atmosphere, sense of exploration, and fantastic enemy placement that its predecessors had.  When I started playing this game my experience with the original Dark Souls (and Demons Souls) made me believe that I would be able to catch on really quickly.  Boy did Dark Souls II shove my hubris down my throat.  While I beat the original countless times I felt like I had to relearn everything again when I started playing this game.  Shielding takes longer, the timing for parrying is different, the enemies recover quicker, etc.  Essentially the way I played Dark Souls was useless to me here.  So while this game does feel and play a lot like the previous Souls games it also doesn't ride its predecessors success at all and has quite a few gameplay quirks and a ton of new creative difficulty to give you that suffering that hurts so good.  My only complaint is that a couple of the bosses feel like they were ripped them out of the last game.  Hell one of the bosses is a straight copy of one of the bosses from the original Dark Souls (I'M LOOKING AT YOU BLUE CATHEDRAL!).  I would've loved to see purely original bosses but it is a very minor complaint from me and overall this is a truly fantastic game that has completely captivated me like few games can.  I highly recommend it and I honestly believe that the Souls series is now the best current franchise in video games at least amongst RPGs.  Seriously if you love a challenge and/or enjoyed what the other games had to offer, BUY THIS GAME!!! NOW! Oops I said I was gonna make this short.  I guess I failed again haha!  Update:  I recently beat the game again (with a new character) and subsequently played through the original Dark Souls again.  Comparing the two I have to admit that while dark souls II is a very challenging game and is a joy to play the original is still a superior game in most aspects and is the more difficult of the two.  Don't get me wrong, I love them both but the original has better atmosphere, more difficult bosses, and more creative enemy and level design.  I have to admit that when I first reviewed Dark Souls II it had been awhile since I played the original and I kinda forgot how much of a masterpiece it is.

I have all the PS versions and the Vita (a great underrated machine), and now I have the PSVR... the PSVR :(  I will make this short and as clear as possible. For those of you who have not tried the PSVR yet you must know the following:  - You see those videos on youtube where some guy is playing some game on PSVR but we only can see the images on their TV's? You see there nice PS4 graphics, very crisp and well defined. What you actually see when you have your PSVR on is a blurier and pixelled version of it. I would say that half of the quality is lost when you have the PSVR on.  - In addition to this, you always have the impression that you are looking through a beekeeper's hat and mask (through a net). This effect is permanent. You can see it not only when you are playing games but all the time. I have heard that this Screen Door Effect is less notable on the PSVR than the other head sets (this disappoints me big time).  - You can play non VR games and see movies in cinematic format, where you will have a big screen in the front of you like if you were in a movie theater. You have 3 sizes (small, medium and big screen). If you are thinking of playing the upcoming Skyrim Remastered on your PSVR under this cinematic format you have to know that the resolution drops significantly. You will only get a big screen in the front of you (which is cool) but you will have to sacrifice the details of your games and movies when you will use this feature.  I my opinion the PSVR is not yet ready but this is not precisely a bad thing. This is only the beginning on this exiting technology. Despite these issue mentioned above I have to say that you still get this sense of immersion and wonder. This technology have too many possibilities and I'm quite sure that these issues will be solved once this tech becomes more mainstream. PSVR have all my support and I cannot wait until more games comes out and when I will finally see these issues are covered. Perhaps the PS Pro will help somehow.

The only problem that I encountered was with a poor camera system. The settings can be adjusted and through trial and error you'll find a setting that you desire. The bugs have all been fixed (for the most part) through updates and patches, so no worries there either.  What I found the most enjoyable was the expansion. MotB solved almost all the problems (camera) that the original had in it, and the story is significantly better.  Some minor problems I personally had with the game included a varied level of voice acting. Some was terrific, some was apalling. It just seemed to be random. Lastly whenever a character would cast a spell, the same voice response would be triggered and it became immensely annoying after 40 hours of gameplay.

I just can't believe the amount of detail that is included!  Graphics are out of this world.  Great game play.  I'm a big fan of the sneaking around genre.  Great character development and story.  You really make a connection with the characters.  All the cut scenes are top notch.  I never get bored playing this game, it feels new and fresh every time I play.

2622,363080,4,False,"09 9, 2014",A1ESUYMIG3TZT0,B00KVOVBGM,Bobby  W.,"If Amazon allowed reviewers to post half stars, I'd give my new PS4 4& stars.  Some of my ""peeves"" have to do with ""Destiny"" (see below), but as I  bought the Destiny Bundle, I think it's still fair to include it in my overall score.  I own every Playstation from the original on up, so I knew it would be a great console, and it is:  Small, sleek footprint - no power ""brick"" (I am no Xbox One basher, but it is pretty funny to watch those YouTube comparisons).  The build quality seems good, it runs fairly quiet, and Glacier White is a nice change of pace.  In my opinion, all of the improvements to the Dualshock 4 controller are welcome, including the slightly bigger and rounder handgrips and improved trigger (shoulder) buttons. The new touch pad is also a big ""button"" itself, and has some interesting possibilities.  The operating system is (for the most part) cleaned up and pretty easy to navigate (much improved over PS3).  System utilities are improved - you can charge the controller without the console needing to be fully powered up, you can download updates in the background, etc. You can change the brightness of the lightbar on the controller, and you can adjust the controller speaker's volume.  One weird thing is that to turn off your controller (which I did a lot while playing Blu Ray movies on my PS3), you have to drill down a couple menu steps - on the PS3, this operation is a lot quicker.  Most important of all of course, currently available PS4 games look good and play very smoothly and are great fun - really looking forward as the PS4 exclusive titles pick up momentum in the next few months!  I did some research before buying, so I knew some things this system would be missing, but in case you don't know:  The PS4 will not play PS3 games, and let's face it, there's still a lot of play left in PS3 titles.  Unlike its predecessors, the PS4 doesn't have a dedicated RCA audio output - if you are just using your TV's onboard speakers, then sure, HDMI is a one connector solution, but if you want to route the PS4 audio to a separate sound system, that system needs to have an HDMI or optical input.  I've got an Onkyo amp that isn't ancient and has hosted my PS3 for several years - but all it has are RCA ins, so I can't use it with my PS4.  Sure, RCA is old technology, but Sony STILL  puts cassette players in most of their boom boxes, for cripes sake! How much would it have cost them to include RCA outs like they've always done?  The hard drive is only 500Gb - that might seem big, it's really not, considering that some games now require a minimum of 50Gb, and it'll probably go up.  Yes, you can buy a DIY drive upgrade, but not everybody wants to dive into their PS4's guts.  I wish Sony would have tiered the product - i.e., made it also available with a 1Tb drive - I think a lot of people would have paid the extra cost if it were an option.  I knew about the non backward compatibility, the lack of RCA outs and the smallish hard drive -what I didn't know was that for ""Destiny,"" a ""sufficiently robust WI-FI connection may be required"".  Yep, even if you just play the campaign, you have to be online because apparently even the campaign has multiplayer elements. I can appreciate that they have a  grand plans for this game, but I hope this isn't the start of a trend for other titles.  I have a decent WI-FI setup, but not the best.  Every PS4 title I had purchased loaded without incident, but I struggled with the online requirements of ""Destiny,"" and that was frustrating.  When I finally got the update downloaded, I was able to play for about 45 minutes without a glitch, and yes, it is no doubt an awesome game.  I just don't like the idea that every time I fire up ""Destiny"" I'll also have to power up my network and hope that it's ""sufficiently robust"" that day. :)  Worth mentioning:  Several people have been having trouble with the coating on the thumbsticks (joysticks...whatever) on their PS4 controllers disintegrating with regular use, and others have had no such issues.  I don't think it's mishandling,  it might be an interaction with the oils & sweat from some people's hands and that particular formulation of material.  I have a not too old Logitech mouse with a rubberized coating that's  doing the same ""shedding""  thing.

I saw that the map was the same, that all they really added was aliens instead of gangs. The missions would be linear. However, I was pleasantly surprised once I got past the first hour of the game. Let's be honest, this wasn't a terrible intro. For Saints Row fans, this was actually quite enjoyable, with the jokes and gameplay being very funny and exciting. A lot of references are made, and there is a great deal of action. While it does feel a bit rushed, the game doesn't leave fans asking for more. (For those of you who AREN'T really fans, just wait.) So then you get to the core of the game, the simulator. Yes, this is basically Steelport with alien towers, no Saints stuff, and a huge ship on top. Feels like DLC. However, the story and mechanics are completely different. The story is quite interesting, almost heartbreaking at certain points, and keeps you wanting to continue. I also liked how the made the minigames into subsections of the new ""side mission"" category,"" so they feel less repetitive and more important to the story. Yes, the game is fun with superpowers too. Some people complain it's too easy. PLAY ON HARDCORE. SERIOUSLY. If you play on NORMAL, then yes, it is not going to be a challenge. You can just sprint up to enemies and punch them or use a blast on them. Easy, right? But if you play on hardcore, this simply does not work. The aliens are very aggressive and accurate. Meaning running and punching isn't a good strategy. Even with superpowers, you will have a bit of a challenge on hardcore, at least in the first half of the game or so. The characters in the game are pretty awesome, though I do not like how they just threw a bunch of new ones in. That was kind of annoying, but I kinda got over it once they began to grow on me. The antagonist is particularly noted, as he is both clever and pure evil. His phrases and actions remind me of Handsome Jack from BL2. He is cocky, but also pushes your character to desperation many times in the game. It is clear that Saints Row Four is the big ending to the series (at least for THIS crew), but it does lack in a FEW areas. The intro is a little rushed, superpowers are overpowered on any difficulty besides hardcore, and cars are for the most part useless. However, the game is FUN. Saints Row Four reminded me what Fallout 3 taught me. Graphics don't matter, and small problems don't matter; if the game makes you lose track of the time, then it is worth playing. Saints Row Four definitely deserves a 9 out of 10.

2632,18143,2,False,"03 18, 2011",A2B68AP9VTKQDI,B00004W4QJ,R. Butler,"Okay, seriously, there needs to be some straightening out here.  Let me get one thing out of the way first: I love this series. The first game blew me away when I played it, and I can't even play it now without remembering just about everything that happened, in sequence. The second game had a nice narrative, but fell far short from the original. I love it, but it deserves the following spanking. Allow me to explain. A few major spoilers ahead.  *Battle System: This is the one big, fat, 800-pound gorilla in the elevator for this game. Seriously, are you people REALLY so ecstatic that its real-time? Parasite Eve was an RPG, and a damned good one at that; ...this... is an action-horror survival game with some amount of RPG thrown in, just enough to earn the genre title for most. It's basically Resident Evil minus the zombies. That's it. The targeting is terrible at all times, the camera angles make it nigh impossible to target the appropriate thing that you want dead, and... well, it's way too easy. Once you've pointed at the thing, you just shoot it. Bam. Dead. Next one. I died, maybe, four times total, two of those were near the end of the game, and one was from that GODS-FORSAKEN MAN-FACED HORSE THING. In fact, I wouldn't even call this an RPG; it's just a run-of-the-mill survival horror, with less horror and more survival - and even that's iffy, because I was only truly afraid, maybe, once.  *Story: It's your atypical ""big bad corporation makes things worse"" scenario that's been beaten to death before this game, and has been beaten to death since. The only shining moments in this game are the boss battles, which provide just a LITTLE more difficulty than the normal fights (and, if you're a total perv, the shower scene; admit it, you whacked off to that too when you were that age!).  *Characters: Aya and Eve are the only two that stand out in this game, with Aya winning the race by a mile. Still, I would love to see how Eve turns out in The Third Birthday, but I doubt they'll even add her in, since she was sorta a side-effect in this game as well! Everyone else is, for the lack of no better words, forgettable. I don't even remember what the gun-toting redneck's name was!

Never again will I wait for Steam to update itself every single time I load up the game, never...  As for Episode One:  Graphics: It is admittedly starting to look dated. Graphically it doesn't compete with the latest games (FEAR, Oblivion or even Tomb Raider for goodness sakes) but nevertheless it is better still than average. The Half-Life engine is still the best at creating facial characters (at least vis-a-vis Oblivion) though this seldom matters. The textures, particularly when you are close up are very dated compared to modern games but the water still shines in its subtle way. You still feel like you are in a hovercraft, as there is no real sense of moving properly or stepping - you are simply sliding around, no real sense of proper movement, you cast no shadows and have no legs, you are basically riding a rail.  Sound: Superb. This is where the game really shines. Great sound effects and the music maintains the momentum of the scene in question to aid in the atmosphere.  AI: Half Life 2 was a step down in this department from Half Life 1 and this is still the case here. There are no tough opponents in this game and no clever tactics to defeat you that were present in the Half Life 1 and its brilliant sequel Opposing Force. Much better things to be found elsewhere.  Story Telling. This is where Valve has traditionally shined. The original Half Life was a masterpiece in this area. More recent games such as FEAR and FarCry borrowed heavily from Half Life 1 and in some areas expanded on it. Half Life 2 though, despite some brilliant set pieces was a step backward in this area from the original. Episode 1 does nothing to bring back the atmosphere from Half Life 1 and does not offer and real answers to the questions being raised. When Half Life 2 was released I was working in the gaming industy. The game was hyped to the unbelievable and I bought it on the first day. After a week none of the gamers talked about it again as everyone had moved on to games with some substance. Nothing will change with Episode 1.  Value for Money: You are better off waiting for the FEAR expansion pack or playing Oblivion (if for some reason you haven't discovered it as yet).

2659,74892,4,False,"08 10, 2011",A21Q29J3ZWPDNP,B000B8K7RC,From Detroit,"As a fan of the classic CRPG's Baldur's Gate II, Fallout and Planescape: Torment, I had high hopes for the Neverwinter Nights series.  I was hoping for parties of characters that shared colorful banter.  This game isn't that, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!  Even though this game is rather old, it still holds up, in my opinion!  Yeah, the graphics are a bit dated, but they still look nice. The game play is a mix between Baldur's Gate style games, and Diablo.  It's a top-down dungeon crawl with a bit more menu to work with.  Combat will be a bit slower than Diablo, and you pay more attention to detail in this game than you would in say Baldur's Gate (you only have one character to deal with, not 6.)  I've only played through the main campaigns, and here's my summary of them:  NWN:  The game is fine enough, as the story line is only fairly interesting.  The game-play is where this one shines, though!  I found the combat in this game to be very fun.  I played through most of the game as a rogue, then all the way through as a paladin.  You only get one side character at a time, and each one has a little bit of story.  Basically, take one with you and do some adventuring.  As time goes on, they'll fill you in on their past and ask you to do a favor for them.  Once it's complete, they will reward you with a magical item that'll prove fairly useful.  As the game progresses, these trinkets can be upgraded.  My personal favorite character was the halfling rogue.  His story was the most interesting, and his skills can be very useful.  The cleric wastes all her magic on destroying undead, so I found playing through the as a paladin and taking the rogue with me whenever possible was the best for me.  This portion of the game gets a solid 4 stars from me.  SoU:  This expansion basically serves as an interlude to get you form the previous to the next.  The story was only OK, and there wasn't much new added to the game-play (though you lose karma in this title if you use the rogue to pick locks!)  If I recall correctly, you get some ability to control your NPC's inventory, which is nice.  I mostly took the dwarf rogue with me through this portion.  None of the NPC's really had my interest for long.  She took care of traps for me, and that was enough.  This part only got 3 stars in my book...  HoU:  This expansion was AMAZING for me.  Going through the Underdark is a lot of fun, and you get a wopping 2 NPC's at a time.  YES!  THERE IS BANTER!  The kobold bard from the previous title (was pretty annoying then) follows you through out.  He's pretty much comic relief.  I really enjoyed the story and the characters here.  I think there might have been a slight graphical upgrade too.  Also, there is a way to customize your gear, so you can make your awesome magical gear even more awesome!  5 stars!

2677,144429,5,False,"01 9, 2009",A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B000X1PE16,Brendan Foy,"I absolutely love this game. It is incredibly well made, polished in every aspect and accomplishes what it sets out to do - entertain and scare the living crap out of you. My favorite horror game since Resident Evil 2. It is far better than Bioshock, in my opinion, and beats Condemned hands down, a game I enjoyed immensely.  The graphics in this game are exceptional. From the dark and macabre art style to the detail and crispness of the visuals, you will be in awe at what you see as well as thoroughly grossed out. The game is dark (it IS a survival horror after all) and it takes place in a Space Station but rarely do the visuals get repetitive. It is an adventure for your eyes all the way through and the sights to behold get more impressive as the game progresses. You have to see it for yourself.  The main character, Isaac, looks fantastic and his upgradeable suit makes feel like a complete badass until some creature tears you half. The animations are very well done and Isaac labors around in his heavy suit just as you would expect him to. It looks so convincing you might feel yourself getting an asthma attack if you're not already suffering from a panic attack thanks to the games surreal atmosphere. The creatures you face are equally as detailed as Isaac and move just as fluid. They look like something out of your worst nightmares and most likely will be in your next nightmare. Shooting off legs and arms looks as grisly as it sounds and there is nothing quite like shooting off the leg of a creature only to have it clawing its way toward you at an increasing pace while you frantically reload. The creatures you face have a decent range in variety but a few more types would have been perfect. The ones we do have are well thought out and must be combated differently from one another. The mini bosses and bosses you come across are jaw dropping. Fighting them is intimidating and intense while defeating them leaves you with a pure sense of accomplishment. Do not be surprised if you are gasping for breath afterwards. This game just looks stunning and that is only part of what makes it such a memorable experience.  The sound equals the graphics in quality and pulls no punches when it comes to creeping you the hell out. You will be tense and under constant duress thanks to the ominous noises you hear while making your way through the bleak, massive mining ship. The music is great, a classical score which sets the mood perfectly. The grunts and groans of Isaac are convincing when he gets hit, you can just feel his pain and terror. The shrieks, hisses, growls and howls of the creatures will send shivers up and down your spine and cause tightness in your chest. Some of the creatures make noises I can't even describe, all I can say is they sound inhuman and demonic. You will hear these creatures scurrying about in the vents above and around you, waiting to strike or you will hear something massive off in the distance in the direction you are heading. The sound in this game, particularly if you have surround sound or a surround sound headset (I use Tritton AxPros), will fill you with dread while the graphics finish off the deadly one-two combo leaving you begging for mercy. No movie and no novel can get to me the way Dead Space has. To top it off, the voice acting in this game is as high in quality as an animated feature film. The potency of the graphics and sound created such a disturbing atmosphere that I felt like a kid watching Halloween or The Exorcist for the first time. I loved it.  This is not a movie or book though, it is a game, and the most important part of a game is the gameplay. Once again, Dead Space does not disappoint. The controls are tight, responsive and intuitive. Never was my experience compromised because of unresponsive or whacky controls. You and Isaac will move through the ship as one. Now some may think Isaac moves around too sluggish for their tastes, he is wearing a heavy space suit after all, but his slow movement actually adds to the tension and immersion of the game. It seems every aspect of this game was thought out and pre planned a head of time to provide you with the ultimate experience. The only slight gripe I have when it coems to his controls is that the melee seems a little too sensitive. Sometimes I just want to hit a creature once, to knock it back, but because I am a little freaked out I might tremble a bit and ever so slightly hit the button a second time causing Isaac to immediately melee a second time, backhanded. This leaves me open for an enemy to strike. A minor gripe in what are otherwise near flawless controls.  The game is essentially a corridor based survival. You will go from room to room and blood soaked hallway to blood soaked hallway. Thanks to the graphics and sound all of this sucks you right in but the gameplay mixes up your experience very well. I don't want to spoil anything so I will keep this brief but you do more than just walk around a ""haunted"" spaceship being scared and killing bad guys. You will find yourself in zero gravity situations, spacewalking where you must watch your oxygen level, shooting a turret like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo on the Millenium Falcon and even spending some time at a shooting range or playing a futuristic game called Z-ball. You will also find yourself in massive rooms with gorgeous views of an asteroid field and other sights and in thundering, fiery engine rooms which will make you sweat. Now I don't want to spoil anything so I can't go into too much detail but trust me, the game keeps you in interesting situations and surroundings right up to the very end. It does not let up.  You also have abilities (powers) such as Stasis which freezes your enemies as well as objects (for solving puzzles) and Kineses where you can control objects telekinetically. These abilites are a godsend and work great with the weapons for combat and are used in some interesting puzzle solving situations as well. The weapons in Dead Space can get pretty creative and go well beyond your standard pulse rifle (in the game) and flamethrower (in the game). My personal favorite was the Line Gun which shot out a laser like beam horizontally; perfect for severing both legs at one time. This weapon had a secondary fire where it fired a timed proximity plasma mine and it worked beautifully. All the weapons have a secondary fire.  The pacing of the game is very well done. All survival horror games start off scary and then lose their steam as time goes on. The same does happen with Dead Space as you get used to the game world but the game manages to evolve its gameplay very well to keep you interested. You will always be creeped out thanks to the graphics and sound but as you progress through the game you will find yourself more involved with the upgrading of your equipment, advancing the storyline and exploring new areas. The game goes from pure horror to action horror to thriller and then back to horror again. It does a real good job keeping you interested and satisfied and always has one more scare to make you jump and keeps your heart rate a few beats above normal. The pacing of the game is very well done other than a slight slow period around the middle of the game, but then it's back to burning on all cylinders again. The end is fantastic and unlike most games does not feel rushed at all. The ending is perfect climax to a wonderful game.  Obviously I loved this game. It is such high quality that it may sound like I think it is perfect. well no game is perfect and there are areas I think Dead space could have been better in. As few as they are, I'll just list them briefly:  - The creatures aren't as dynamic as I would like. They crawl through the vents, this is how they get around the ship and get to you. The problem is they only do this in unexplored areas or areas that story has lead you to. If you go back to an area you have already cleared out just to get a health pack you didn't have room for in your inventory last time you visited, nothing will attack you or follow you there. Now I don't need to be constantly harassed because this would make the game tedious but no area should ever feel ""safe"" just because I have been there before. Once in a while I should have heard some clanging in the vents as something was coming for me. Makes the times you will be attacked less predictable.  - I already mentioned the sensitive melee button. Not a big deal but a slight gripe.  - A couple of the middle chapters were slow moving but all in all the game was a complete rush.  - The story is somewhat generic, with an alien infection plot line, blah blah. The storytelling however is very well done however. Very few cutscenes and everything done in real time. I just wish horror games would go back to using the supernatural and forget all this infection stuff.  In Conclusion:  Everything about this game oozes quality and production value. When I first heard of Dead Space several months ago I was interested. I desperately wanted a good survival horror game based in space. Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected Dead Space to not only meet my expectations but surpass them completely. There is no multiplayer here, no coop and no established license for the game to fall back on. Dead Space stands on its own two feet as an exceptionally well made single player experience which keeps you captivated until the very end. When it is all over (it took me over 20 hours to beat it on hard mode) you will find yourself watching the credits until the very end because you will appreciate the effort that much. At least that is what I did.  I couldn't recommend this game more. My letter grade for Dead Space would be an A",Chills and Thrills to the End.

I wouldn't pay more than $20 for everything from this game [that includes the base game and all DLCs].  Pros:  1.  Excellent writing and voice acting.  After the snooze-fest script that is the Witcher 3, having dialogue that is consistently engaging delivered with convincing voice actors is a breath of fresh air.  2.  Geniunely dramatic moments.  Seeing the airships at the end of Act I was a sight to behold.  2.  Excellent combat.  The meat and potatoes of this game.  The VATS system is astounding, and after 30+ hours of gameplay, it is still very satisfying to gun down mercenaries, mutants, bugs, and all manners of creatures with the trademark targeting system of Fallout.  3.  Level progression.  Intuitive and gives you incentive to press on.  Cons:  1.  Time consuming, and not in the good way.  I would say that around 70-80% of what you do is filler in this game.  Traveling from place to place, while initially exciting, can be a drag after a few hours due to the lack of vehicles.  The crafting system, while fun, forces you to farm dozens of materials to skill up your gun or armor.  Farming is not fun.  You will also spend half of your time unlocking boxes or doors or computer terminals.  This is a vestige of Skyrim and its predecessors and a decade of playing the lockpick game has lots any novelty it once had.  2.  Graphics.  Not only is traveling time-consuming, you must also add to the fact that the majority of locales are absolutely dreadful to look at.  With the graphical breakthroughs of both GTA and Witcher, it is perplexing that a large part of this game is an eyesore.  Some parts, such as initial sequence of the atom bomb dropping and Kellog's memory, look stunning.  Then there are other parts, such as the entirety of Boston, that looks like lazily developed rubble.  Inexcusable graphics in this day and age.  Also, add the fact that almost every area is behind some kind of loading screen.  You will dread every door you face since you don't know if it's preloaded or if you will have to face another load screen.  3.  Missions.  Again, almost 75% of the missions you engage in will be completely inconsequential ""Travel to X zone to kill Y bad guys and bring back Z item.""  GTA V really broke through this tired gaming design by artfully marrying storyline and inventive missions.  Fallout 4 is lazily padded game missions.  There are simply not enough dramatic moments from mission to mission to hook your interest.

After all, who could want to experience the magic of getting continually blasted by the Blue Shell of Doom, causing long lines of losses? But the Wii's game entourage is limited, and I still wanted to build up a decent library... and I'd always thought Mario Kart games were pretty neat. So I asked for it for Christmas... and I've been having a GRAND time with it since.  The chaos from the frequent item bombardment is immense at times, but for me it kept the races from growing too boring. The course designs are elaborate and fun to look at as you whip around anticipating your next power slide. Now, I've only played one 150cc Grand Prix so far, but I've found that in general it's the obstacles you have to watch out for more than anything if you're aiming to win. Look for the closest corner cuts, check out for any hidden passageways, etc. Heck, I follow the time trial ghosts to see which routes they take... the Coconut Mall one was surprising, as I'd never even known that a certain shortcut she took even existed up until then. But I'm getting off topic.  The courses all come from several past Mario Kart games, plus a few designed especially for this one. It's colorful. Unlocking something is like getting a surprise present, especially with the characters. Eventually you will unlock yourself! Well, that is if you made your Mii look like you. Haha! The bikes ands karts are all noticeably different in how they perform, and you'll be kept busy wondering which one will work the best for what you want. (I favor Rosalina on the Wario Bike myself.)  Now for the two things that I don't care for much... I mentioned earlier that the item chaos keeps things from getting too boring. Well, that's still true, but the constant recovering you'll be doing gets very tiresome after a while. ""I just want to keep moving, is that too much to ask?"" one will say. Also, the character's vocalizations could have used more variety. It was so scary hearing my Mii shout, ""Wahay!"" really loud every few seconds that eventually I had to stop using her, because I couldn't take it anymore.  Well, that's that.

2694,310202,5,False,"10 9, 2013",A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B00D8IAND0,Gaming.Fit,"I've reviewed every Just Dance game since the original in 2009. While I've given the spin-offs and rip-offs less-than-stellar reviews, the main games in the series (Just Dance and Just Dance 2, 3, and 4) have always gotten 5 out of 5 stars from me. While the basic mechanics of the game have been the same since the beginning, Ubisoft has done a great job of improving accuracy and adding to the feature set in each new version.  This iteration is no exception. Just Dance 2014 should really be called Just Dance 5, but Ubisoft has veered off that numbering scheme and started to name the titles by year, given that they're releasing a new version every year anyway.  When you start out the game, the opening menu is simple as always. In the center of the screen is a recommended song you can start dancing to right away. You can also scroll to the right to select individual songs.  In the upper right-hand corner you'll see a yellow icon with an ""M"" in it. These refer to your ""mojo points"". The points system is much easier to understand now than in previous versions of Just Dance; here, they serve as ""currency"" that you can use to ""purchase"" locked items in the game.  One nice thing about Just Dance 2014 is that none of the songs themselves are locked--every song is playable from the get-go. Instead, what's locked are different variations of the choreography that's available on certain songs. Here are all the different variations:  - Classic - The standard, default choreography, all of which are unlocked from the beginning.  - On Stage - Multiple dancers interacting with each other in a ""dance performance"", which are a lot of fun not only for the dancers but also for onlookers. These are each 10 points to unlock.  - Extreme - These are more advanced dance routines, not for beginners. They're 25 points to unlock. Battle - This is a mode where you compete against another player in a ""Street Fighter"" like battle--the better you dance, the more you'll increase your life line and decrease your opponent's. These are 10 points to unlock.  - Mash-Up - Here, different dance moves (and the original dancers) from other songs and from past versions of Just Dance are pieced together to form a unique dance. These are 5 points to unlock, or throughout the year you'll be able to unlock one for free each month.  - Sweat - Songs are choreographed with maximum exercise, fitness, and aerobic activity in mind. These are 10 points to unlock.  - Sweat Mash-Up - A combination of Mash-Up and Sweat modes, these are 5 points to unlock.  - Puppet Master - Like Mash-Up mode, except that a human is controlling which dance steps the players will dance next using the Wii U Gamepad.  - Others - Several songs have very unique choreography. Gwen Stefani's Rich Girl has a ""Chair"" dance. Far East Movement's Turn up the Love has something called ""Sumo"". And Nicki Minaj's ""Starships"" lets you dance to the Charleston. Each of these are 50 points to unlock.  One relatively new feature is the ability to click the upper right-hand corner to select or create a ""dancer card"". This will allow you to provide your nickname, an avatar (you choose from a set of cute cartoon faces all blinking at you), your gender, and your age.  Once you set up your dancer card, when you click on it you'll see at-a-glance your style (how accurate you are), your kCals burned in Sweat Mode, your favorite songs, your average star rating, and your online level. It's nice not having to go by ""Happy"" or ""Sunny"" anymore.  The dancing itself works pretty much the same as past Just Dance games. Each song's choreography is designed for 1-4 different players. If you're playing with 2 or more players, each player will use his or her Wii remote to select a character to follow, and can also choose his or her dancer card so that statistics will be properly tallied. Each player then holds the Wii remote in his or her right hand and follows the on-screen dancer's moves as if looking in a mirror.  The animation on screen, as usual, is usually done with tongue firmly planted in cheek. A zombie is dancing to Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"". The song ""The Love Boat"" is set to a scene of the eponymous cruise ship sinking in the background.  As with previous versions of Just Dance on the Wii, don't expect the motion detection to be as precise as the Kinect, although it is impressive how accurate they've gotten it over the years.  The Wii U version makes nice use of the GamePad to include people who for whatever reason can't (or won't) participate in the dancing. Karaoke mode allows that person to sing along to the words (which are displayed on the GamePad screen), and if the singing is good, it'll earn M points. Alternatively, the person holding the GamePad can use the GamePad's camera to film the dancers in ""Autodance"" mode, which will produce a 30 second video that'll be automatically edited in a stylized way and then can be saved or shared or uploaded to JDTV (see below).  Other options on the main menu include the following:  - Just Sweat - This mode allows you to play several songs in a row for 10, 20, or 40 minute programs. You can also turn on ""free mode"", which turns on a calorie counter that tracks you calories for any song in the game.  - Shop - As you play the game, you'll earn points, which are tallied by a yellow ""M"" in the corner of the screen. You can use these points to ""purchase"" unlockable content for the game. These include:  1) Alternate Choreography. Here's where you can unlock ""On Stage"" , ""Extreme"", ""Sweat"" and ""Battle Mode"" choreography for songs. As of the launch of the game there are 24 of these to unlock, ranging from 10 to 50 points.  2) Mash-Ups & Co. Here, you can download Mash-Ups and Sweat Mash-Ups of songs, as well as different Party Master modes. There are 77 of these to unlock, which should keep you pretty busy. All are 5 points to unlock, and there'll be a ""free one"" to unlock each month of the year (as long as you're connected online you'll get a pop-up each month that alerts you to the free mash-up and avatar that's available for you).  3) New Songs. Unfortunately you can't use your points to unlock new songs--you'll need real money for that. Ubisoft cleverly weaved a list of purchasable songs into this menu so you'll always be reminded of it when you're unlocking content. They even offer a free song, Katy Perry's Roar, for you to learn the download process (when you select a song you're sent to Nintendo's eShop to complete your purchase). When you buy a song, you'll get avatars thrown in for free.  The ""World Dance Floor"" option will show up if you're signed in. A number will show how many dancers are currently online. This is an interesting online mode where you can literally dance with players from around the world, earn points along the way, and even make friends. The good news if you're protective of your online identity is that you're not personally identifiable, other than the name on your dancer card.  There are a number of activities on the Dance Floor. You can participate in dance offs against other players, you can dance to the same song with everyone in the group and see who's the best, and you can vote on which song to dance to next. There's a countdown timer to ""Happy Hour"", when you can earn extra points. It's a lot of fun, and it really adds a new dimension to dancing (when it works, that is--I've been having some issues trying to connect to Ubisoft's servers).  Finally, there's another online feature called JDTV that consists of videos that other players around the world have uploaded. This was a feature available on the Xbox, but it's now available with the Wii U when someone films the dancers in ""Autodance"". You can view the most recent, the most popular, and featured videos, as well as your own.  Overall, I'm impressed yet again with this latest version of Just Dance. Every time I think the franchise is about the jump the shark, they make enough improvements to impress me yet again. The song list is a great mix of contemporary songs and oldies, there's enough variation in choreography to keep from getting bored, and the new points system to collect and ""buy"" items to unlock is much simpler to understand than in previous versions. The highlight, of course, is the new online features that let you compete and play with others around the world. it just adds a new level knowing that others around the globe are playing along with you.",Another great update with online play and some unique features for Wii U,1381276800,43.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,player activity sweat save i've performance shop star who's understand release is--i've player street calorie scroll follow get point favorite veer franchise many thing allow open expect different song ability happy firmly aerobic stage star fun advanced mechanic really mode anymore autodance turn original right decrease let far try recent locked--every easy eshop alternatively videos highlight dancer off version hour unlock version screen let there'll row track calorie late work finally jump include at-a-glance click kinect main spin-off design film process nicki set overall collect countdown sink playable system refer follow call cleverly go precise year do they're every dance nickname camera face onlooker away choreograph weaved much view person connect tongue remote none they've unlock wii remind default like xbox purchasable extra level program start turn character usually improve usual activity connect dance everyone cute can't group mirror unlock several share gender name piece alternate unique money well long unfortunately floor friends one detection personally identifiable love icon new whatever increase relatively impressive option hold accurate item certain cheek add time impress ubisoft's pop-up issue buy get-go identity game also anyway mash-up see simple year human rich scene choose gamepad edit sunny play serve style since classic range yet jdtv girl center allow there's basic featured improvement use always extreme lock give film second nice launch earn menu contemporary hand use control cruise sing automatically dancer yellow download average song ubisoft need maximum think others minaj's fighter exercise job create next counter mash-ups routine avatar upper enough eponymous protective consist know statistic stefani's puppet although interesting review dimension course offer series lot unlockable gaynor's gamepad's feature kcals sign number vote able free good katy online add variation plant game perry's purchase mind what's globe background standard corner produce provide start form step battle--the co oldie send select make move rating begin i'm word combination best along starship previous life charleston throughout motion display individual well another look iteration age karaoke master month burn option title chair currency way feature on-screen opponent's rip-offs news boat properly someone world fitness gwen tally less-than-stellar impressed video thrown mode upload recommended something great multiple beginner simple real songs--you'll song's east nintendo's line that's variation play here's mojo currently stylize popular server ship reason exception sing sumo shark together card list participate minute number avatar cartoon learn timer hold movement's literally complete choreography even battle accuracy mix except it'll animation roar zombie review get around instead blink content scheme alert dancer's make party bore compete people available past get busy show right-hand survive keep interact gloria pretty follow

2699,347770,4,True,"01 19, 2015",A1NRCHRSDXYFW5,B00IZXXF92,Luis M. Fuentes,"This review is for the BlackWidow Tournament Edition Stealth Keyboard.  This keyboard is great. I love that the USB cable is detachable similar to the keyboards seen in the hobby circles (Ducky, Vortex, etc.). The included USB cable is braided, as small as this addition seems, it makes a big difference in the long term reliability of the cable.  The surface of the keyboard is a smooth matte finish. It has a nice heft towards the top due to the wedge shape which makes it feel sturdy. It also comes with a velvet carrying bag, making lugging this thing around hassle free if you are on the go.  Since this is a tenkeyless keyboard (as in to say it does not have a numberpad) it has a smaller footprint. Great for those with small desks and again, those on the go.  Let's talk switches. Razer has two types of switches: Razer greens and Razer oranges. If you are familiar with hobby mechanical keyboard then you have heard of Cherry MX, which is probably the leader in mechanical switches. The Razer greens are an equivalent to the Cherry MX blues. This keys have an audible ""click"" when typing. They are also the units you are likely to find in stores. However, this Stealth edition has Razer Oranges, which are more like the Cherry MX browns. They have a ""tactile"" feeling but remain quiet.  With that said, we should really discuss what I mean by ""quiet"". If you are expecting this to make zero noise, you need to reassess your exceptions. In effect, if the Razer Greens make a ""click"" sound, the Razer Oranges make a ""clack"" sound. But even though it makes a sound, it is still quieter than the greens or MX cherry blues. The oranges take the edge off the sound and removes the piercing ""click"", which can be distracting to those around you, people on vent, or in live-streams (unless you have some noise canceling going on in your mic). So again, it's a less obtrusive sound.  Now for the quality of the keys/switches;I prefer the Razer greens and Razer oranges over the MX Cherry equivalents. I prefer the action and ""tightness"" of the switch over those of the Cherries. I should be fair in saying that the switches will ""break"" in eventually during use, since this is a new keyboard, but this is true for any mechanical keyboard. The changes over time are not major, but I am hoping it retains the characteristics I enjoy of each keystroke over time.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the keys are not backlit. This would be the perfect,  tenkeyless keyboard, if only the thing was backlit.  Razer, if you are listening, I would gladly pay $20 more for a Pro edition of this thing, that has the back lighting. Hell, make a Chroma version and charge $40 more.  If you do not mind the keys not being back-lit and are in the market for a tenkeyless keyboard, I would highly recommend this bad boy. But me personally?  This keyboard only made me want more. I ended up ordering the BlackWidow ultimate stealth because I really prefer to have something with back-lighting. And even though I order the tournament edition because I wanted to save on desk space, I didn't realize how much I would miss the number pad (I do 10 key typing quite often throughout the week).  What will happen to my Tournament Edition Stealth? I will be taking it with me to the office and using it at work.

But it just gets more and more ""Michael-Bay""- dumb action set-pieces, intrusive cutscenes, turrets, bosses with glowing weaknesses. Resident Evil 4 tried to separate itself from the convoluted and stupid backstory of the previous games. Resident Evil 5 embraces all of that horrible junk. By the end, you are literally fighting Wesker on top of a volcano and there is no horror left. By the way, Wesker might be the most embarrassingly tone-deaf character in all of fiction. The minute he starts his bullet-dodging Matrix crap, I wanted to never play this again; Wesker represents Japanese developers' insistence that they understand what Western audiences think is ""cool"" but it is just embarrassing that an adult came up with this character. It took Resident Evil 4 2/3 of the game before I earnestly desired for it to end. Resident Evil 5 wore out its welcome much, much faster. Added to this, you have to babysit an idiotic AI partner and your inventory system is nightmarishly inferior to what is was in Resident Evil 4.

Durham,"Brothers in Arms makes it's way to the DS with the aptly titled Brothers in Arms DS, which finds the long running first person shooter set in World War II getting shrunk down and scaled back to accomodate the dual screens of Nintendo's handheld.  The first thing you'll notice about Brothers in Arms DS is that the game features some pretty good graphics for a DS game that really push the hardware to a new limit.  After that though, it's mostly downhill though considering everything that needed to be changed around in order for the game to appear on the DS.  The style has changed from an FPS to a third person shooter that utilizes a ""duck & cover"" technique that actually works well.  What really hurts the game however are the bad camera angles, annoying pop up enemies, and the control scheme which utilizes the directional pad, shoulder button, and touch screen as well.  The controls are by far the game's biggest flaw, as you may in fact get used to them, but in the heat of battle, will be swearing on a consistent basis thanks to them.  Four player multiplayer is included as well, and is really where the bulk of the fun is to be had here.  Brothers in Arms DS isn't too challenging, and it's over before you know it as well, but it's not a bad game either by any stretch of the imagination.

2708,147359,5,False,"05 13, 2009",ADPIMPRLTKBS5,B000Z9A95M,Jose Deza,"Let's start by saying that this game was originally released for Playstation 2. But don't get fooled, this game is a million times better on the Wii, almost meant to be for the Wii.  If you ask me to buy a game, I as many of you would probably do is read about it, about its gameplay, graphics, duration, audio, story, genre, etc. So that's what I will donow.  So, about graphics let's just say that if you're those gamers that preferred the almost real 1080p reolution, you may probably find it as an issue here. As a playstation 3 owner I can tell you that even the fact that the graphics for this amazing game obviously doesn't look real at all, the fact that they look like an aquarella painting, for me it's just an art work, and probably wouldn't change it if I could because it's one os the characteristics that can make you fall in love with th game.  Also, a mayor topic here is the story. Two words, just amazing. It's envolving the whole time, it can suck you like any other incredible games like Zelda. It has many twists in the story that makes you get even more sucked every now and then. So yes, the story is also one of the strong points here.  I don't want to make ths review much longer (or boring if you may) so I will just summarize the other topics I considered to be very important also. Duration, Okami took me around 50 hours to complete and not at a 100% (maybe a 80%). So if you like length, you're in for a treat. Also, the gameplay is very appealing all the way. Actually it resembles the series of Zelda games because of the whole variety of items, weapons and other elements, so for me at least gameplay likethat will fullfill my expectations.  Last but not least is for example, one of the greatest features of this Wii system:  the wii motion controls. That's exactly why Okami is much better on the Nintendo. You play as a god that learns throughout the whole adventure various techniques that involve the using of pointing and moving in the screen with some accuracy for the technique to work, so the wii motion controls plays here a much nicer role in a way that if you imagined using the analog stick od the playstation 2 controller just woudn't do justice.  Well, that's all for the review of one of the greatest, most appealing games I've played in a long time. Buy it, now it's less than 20 buck and the experiece you'll get is more valuable. Also, Capcom, the developers of this game said that they would love to do a sequel but for that to happen they just want to wait for the original Okami to increase it's sales.

I've never played Rogue, which others are saying the game is similar to, but I do know that this game is extremely fun.  It's not a shooter, as another reviewer said.  It is a mysterious, dark dungeon crawler, and the primary weapons you use are swords.  There is one gun that you get, but it only has 5 ammo.  You go down a tower floor by floor, fighting grotesque monsters and collecting a variety of items used to customize your character--parasites and brands are an excellent example.  Although you have three ways of attacking with your weapon, you can also use different items as weapons which can really make the game fun.  There are just soooo many items!  As others have said, once you die you start from level one with nothing (unless you figure out how to carry over a few select items of your choosing).  This is part of what makes the game interesting, because the story is so morbidly strange.  You know so little, but every time you get through the tower or die you are able to discover a little bit more of the story.  I haven't finished it yet, and I find myself drawn to go through the tower again and again to finish filling in the gaps.  The game also gets very challenging in the lowest levels of the tower--and I'm not even playing on Hard mode.  Also, I've never found the wall with the face on it that others have talked about, so I guess I need to get through the tower multiple times to see it.  The game is eerie, and can sometimes send some chills down my spine (especially one floor in particular).  It's hard to get tired of this game!  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because you do end up restarting from level one and have to build yourself back up again.  But don't make that scare you away from this game.

I played Fable 2 and 3 and thoroughly enjoyed myself on both. I tried to play the original Fable on my 360 but it seemed to have a bit of lag and just didn't operate like the game should have so I gave up on it. Now that I have the new and improved version I am having a blast , so here are my impressions of the anniversary edition.  1 - The graphics have had a major overhaul , it still doesn't look like a brand new game but the changes that have been made look amazing compared to the original.  2 - no lagging or glitching in this version opposed to the way the original ran on my 360. The original game operated so poorly on my 360 that it took all the fun out of it , but the anniversary edition fixed all of my problems.  3 - the whole menu system has been revamped along with your inventory , spell casting ,etc ,etc ,etc.. This to me is a major improvement. Everything is easily accessible without going through layers and layers of other things to get to what you want.  4 - THE SAVE SYSTEM IS AWESOME , save anywhere any time as long as you are not in an active quest. If you are on an active quest you must finish the quest for your progress to save. Fortunately the quests are all rather on the short side so its not that much of a hassle to just complete what you are doing before quiting the game.  5 - This installment gives you the entire package that includes the lost chapters.  These are just some of the things that have impressed me and as I play this great new game I will update my review accordingly , but from what I can tell so far this will be a 5 star game all the way through. There are just way to many new improvements to list  , everything has been overhauled , character models , land scape , spell casting effects , weapons , clothing , etc , etc .. EVERYTHING has been made over and nothing has been left untouched. Simply awesome if you are a fable fan !!  UPDATE : 2-6-14 There have been a few glitches and lag but after the disk was installed and I was a little farther in it stopped. This game is still just so fun and addicting like Fable 2 & 3. Even with the few problems I have experienced its nothing game breaking and my 5 out of 5 review still stands. EXCELLENT !!  Update : 2-7-14 I added that video to show that I personally am not having any lag or any other problems at the moment and have not for a while.

It keeps your brain sharp, it's fun for all ages, it has challenging and easy modes, and it's inexpensive, too!  First, the basic premise. You have a path laid out in front of you that you can follow, on any face. There is no ""gravity"" - you don't fall off if you stray off the path. You just rotate around to another face of that path. You are, of course, a cube. So each move you make is to flop from one face of the cube onto an adjacent face. So far, so easy.  The trick of course is that no path is straightforward. There are all sorts of obstacles to make your quest a challenge. There are blockades to get around. There are rolling bombs to avoid. Some blocks are brittle and will break once you pass over them. Other blocks will make you temporarily invincible. You can use arrows to redirect rolling bombs, triggers to take down walls and to create new blocks, and much more.  There is a very good training suite for you to go through, to learn all of the combinations. Then they have three separate easy groups so that you get the hang of techniques and learn your skills. Each level is timed, and you can replay them in order to get all the ""keys"" or to do it fast enough to earn you a gold rating.  There's even a level generator, so you can build your own levels, with your own twisted mapping to create the ultimate puzzle!  I really like this game. Of the other puzzle games I enjoy, like the marble puzzles, many of them rely on super-fast reflexes in order to pull off a rolling technique. That's really not the case here. Your ""fly-over"" when the level starts familiarizes you with where everything is. Then, it's a matter of logic. What order do you have to hit buttons in, what series of arrows will get the rolling bomb to get to a certain destination. The cube only flops in its six directions. You don't need to do tricky angled combinations.  Also, the game is very family friendly. There's no shooting, no blood, no swearing. Just a catchy little tune and a cube.  If I have complaints about this game, it's that the menu controls are sometimes a little sluggish - you can't tell for sure if it did get your menu choice and is just thinking about it, or if you need to hit the button again. Also the fly-overs at the beginning of the level are both a bit quick and a bit hard to follow. Usually I just skip the fly over and assume I'll have to play a given level two or three times to learn its layout before I can begin really trying to solve it.  Still, minor complaints for a game that has a ton of levels and is really inexpensive, too.

However, I ended up sticking with it.  In Arcade mode, there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes. In Mortal Kombat on the SNES, I played well on it. In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, I was able to tackle Hard mode. In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy, I can beat Master mode, but that version of this game was too easy. Here, I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode! The game is pretty challenging, but I think if a player's good enough, he can whop through easily.

I disliked Half Life: Counter Strike, immensely enjoyed the No One Lives Forever games, and was disappointed by Unreal 2 (though the game had its good merits). As much as I loved the first Unreal Tournament, after spending some quality time with UT2003, I can honestly say that this game is truly... better. Some people disliked the game because it was too demanding of their systems. This is bull. The engine is refined. A GeForce 3 Ti card on a system with no bottlenecks will run this game smoothly with moderate visual settings, but a GeForce 3 coupled with a 1Ghz proc. is expectedly slow. Why? Because as textures are bump mapped, when volumetric fog is thrown about the maps like candy, and when the poly counts are through the bloody roof, the DEVELOPER EXPECTS PEOPLE WITH DECENT SPECS TO PICK UP THE GAME. Don't cry when your ancient rig can't hang with the new big boys.  Get a 9800 Pro or something and see what you're truly missing. Although it is easy to be disappointed with UT2003 when you find your favorite sniping rifle or map has been removed or modified, most players will begin to appreciate the near perfect balancing scheme Digital Extremes put into place.  There are no overpowering weapons dominating the field.  New game modes like the insanely intense Bombing Run replace the game mode stripped from the original.  The addition of the double jump imposes players with addictive, arcade-feel action... causing firefights to last for minutes, not moments.  Realism isn't the deal here.  Fun is. In conclusion, Unreal Tournament 2003 has an insane amount of content right out of the box.  The Unreal platform is fast, beautiful, updated, hip, and stable.

The bass isn't head pounding, but it is at a comfortable enough level. The mid-range and high-range is typical for most over the ear headphones. The mic can be removed as it plugs into the left ear cup. The mic picks up my voice clearly when used to make phone calls on my Samsung Galaxy S3. The headphones have good noise isolation, acting almost like a set of hearing protectors. In addition, when listening to music at a comfortable level, the audio doesn't leak out of the headphones so it won't bother a roommate. More importantly they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The ear cups have a swivel mount, so they allow more articulation to suit different shapes of heads. The ear cups are large enough to hold my ears without squashing them. The drawback to using the amplifier with the PS4 is that you have to deal with wiring leading to the headphones.

Fortunately for us ""Evil Dead"" fanatics, Campbell is back, and the game plays pretty darn well too. You're in for some good, unclean fun, you primitive screwheads. The story picks up sometime after the end of the third film, and we find Ash tilting a few back in his favorite bar in his quaint hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. Naturally, things aren't quaint for very long. A spectacle-toting professor reads an ancient arcane passage from the Deadites' favorite book on a local television broadcast, and it all goes downhill from there. The inhabitants of Dearborn begin to change into slavering undead freaks - and it's up to Ash and his boomstick to save the day. The storyline is appropriately campy in a fashion that is consistent with the franchise, but otherwise unremarkable. Just the same, it provides all the motivation you will require to dismember hordes upon hordes of Deadites. The game plays out in a way best described as ""Tomb Raider"" meets ""The Thing,"" and the action, while a little bit on the repetitive side, is slick and bloody. Ash will uncover more ways to dispose of the opposition than you, as the player, will ever have time to use in one play-through, and it's just plain addictive. Some puzzles crop up to offset the mayhem, and they provide some welcome cerebral moments that are rarely illogical. During the course of the game, Ash will venture through present day (but Deadite-infested) Dearborn, colonial Dearborn, Civil War era Dearborn, and post-apocalyptic Dearborn. This time travel scenario provides some much-appreciated variety in the locales, and an ""Army of Darkness"" ambience besides. It all looks pretty nice too - crisp and colorful, and fraught with detail. Only the segments of the game that take place in the forests around Dearborn are unattractive, point of fact, and that's saying something when you consider that this is a budge title retailing at about $20. What's more, the character models, while not bursting with detail, are very well animated, and usually quite convincing. Any ""Evil Dead"" fan looking forward to this game is probably asking: ""So, how are Ash's one-liners?"" The answer to that is this: not bad, but not half as well-written as the ones from the films (which is to be expected). Even so, Bruce Campbell's delivery compensates for even the worst of them, and his vocal presence alone is worth the price of admission. Besides, there are some hidden gems scattered here and there that will tickle Deadite aficionados in all the right places. Add to that some well-made cut-scenes (and a BRILLIANT finale), and you've got the closest thing to ""Evil Dead 4"" you're going to see... at least for quite some time. It's not all unbridled joy, though. The game is a bit on the short side, and requires a lot of backtracking and errand running. Boss battles are not very intense, and the solutions to defeating them are all but spelled out for you in a most unsubtle fashion. As an ""Evil Dead"" fan myself, I was also a bit disappointed by some of the enemies in the game, which don't really fit in the ""Evil Dead"" universe, and seem to have come instead from an entirely different game. As a game, without any other considerations, ""Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick"" is good. It plays well, offers a few scares and a few laughs, and a whole lot of M-rated action. As an ""Evil Dead"" fanatic, the game delivers all of the above and the added delight of revisiting Ashley Williams and watching him kick all kinds of Deadite @$$. Finally, as a budget title, this game represents pure excellence. In a rare twist of fate, just because you're paying less doesn't mean you're getting less. Hail to the king, baby.

The game is by far the best Final Fantasy for the Playstation and the second best in the nine game series (fans will remember FF6). In honor of FF7, super attacks, called Trance, have been brought back. Basically if the enemy beats on you enough you become super powerful for about two or three turns. The music is absolutely beautiful. Nobuo did an excellant job. The graphics are nice eye-candy and are only rivaled by the beautiful CG animations. The characters are very innovative as well. You can have a black mage, a guy with a monkey tail (why does he have that anyway), or a big freaky-looking guy with red hair, to name three. Abilites and spells are gained from pieces of armor and weapons. The same piece of armor can also hold three different abilities for three different characters making it important to figure out who gets what when. Another good idea as it keeps your characters from becoming god-like very quickly. To all those who liked the old !school version of Final Fantasys, who could like the modern ones all that much, 1-6 will enjoy the nostalgia of this game. I, for one, can only hope that SquareSoft keeps with this idea and keeps the series from becoming more Sci-Fi than medieval. Anyway, I can't say that there is anything negative about this game.

The stealth and combat in this game are very well done, aside from the occassional hiccup with grappling to the wrong area or not grappling at all.  Overall, the fighting feels good and some enemies require much more than simple button mashing.  The boss battles are intense, and the game really makes you want to punch Penguins face in.  What keeps it from being a 5-star perfect game you ask??  Darkness and repetition.  What Arkham City desperately needs is a more vibrant, livelier city.  I just never felt like a superhero while playing.  All Arkham City is, is darkness and thugs around every corner and on every block.  I understand the theme behind the game is the entire city has become a prison, so this is what you'd find there.  BUT, how great would it be to be in an actual Gotham City?  An actual city with regular people doing regular things....imagine stopping a mugging, or saving bank employees from a hostage situation by smashing through a plate glass window and bashing a few armed thugs.  How great would that be?  That would make me feel like I was playing as Batman.  If they threw in the Bat Mobile to drive around in, or the Bat Motorcycle even how great could that be??  It would be nice to perch atop a building and just watch traffic go by, knowing that you can swoop down at any time and cause havoc if you were not a hero.  When I took out a group of thugs it felt satisfying, but how much more satisfying could it feel if you were bashing the heads of three guys robbing an armored car?  There are so many missions they could have, this game just feels lacking in that it's constantly dreary and there is no one around who isn't in prison.  Again, I understand the game is in a prison....but use your imagination.  I'd love to see almost a Batman, GTA hybrid with an open city to explore and missions you can get involved in if you choose to be the hero, or just ignore if you want to just get the main quest over with.

McKeown,"After my disappointment in the first Monster Hunter game, I was hesitant when I heard they were coming out with a 3rd installment for the Wii.  First off, the Wii isn't known for its graphics - and this is a game that would need good graphics to be worth a buy. Secondly, the Wii is notorious for not having any well-made 3rd party games. After watching the stunning trailers for this game, I finally caved in and bought it. I'm happy to report that it was a great purchase. Not only have I sunk 20 hours into playing it, I've enjoyed every moment of it. It delivers not only with its amazing graphics, but the game play is top notch even with the sometimes awkward wiimote. Monster Hunter Tri is challenging, but not impossible. You may feel stuck from time to time, but exploration usually solves the dilemma. Visually, Monster Hunter Tri is stunning. The landscapes are beautiful and seem to go on as far as the eye can see. The music is pretty good, but usually gets lost in the background. The game does have online availability, which I have not tried yet so I won't review on that. I have played the 2 player mode, however, which is decent. You can join a friend in an arena battle to take down a big monster together. It's fun and you get to practice killing the next big monster on your quest list, but it would've been really great if 2 players could go on a co-op quest together. The monsters each have their own characteristics and traits. Most, however, seem to have a personal vendetta against you and will hunt you down, even if you're just trying to pick flowers. The customization in this game is great. There are several weapons to choose from, and plenty of upgrades to come after. You can even attach charms which give your character extra attributes. All in all, this is a very solid game and worth the buy. I would have enjoyed some voice acting, and a little less pointless jabber from the villagers, but there isn't too much to complain about with Monster Hunter Tri.",Great Game,1274486400,3.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,player give dilemma tri notorious notch awkward join stuck play much i've wii cave solves however extra hour graphic player practice could know heard need come character usually next availability get delivers trailer several mode take disappointment pick secondly big installment great weapon solid hesitant amaze feel monster happy less music fun little really play exploration challenge complain hunt would've jabber wiimote visually beautiful far try act good lose online stun worth together list first charm game arena trait well-made landscape time attribute purchase would background top friend sometimes vendetta buy game pointless decent flower finally even see voice battle plenty report attach quest upgrade buy choose characteristic watch monster moment play i'm enjoy yet co-op come tried customization seem impossible party eye go sunk get villager every may personal killing hunter pretty review

It feels very real. The giant zombies, fresh zombies and human enemies can just simply take you out. The need to scavenge for supplies is just a great feel to me. You don't have to but going through houses looking for supplies makes it more real for me. The slow fade into nightfall is probalby one of my favorite things.

As much as I despised Dragon Age Inquisition (anyone who gave that more then 2 stars should be ashamed of themselves) with how boring and the repetitive nature of that game, this game is vast, fun, and will keep me busy for well into next year. This game is great and deserving of ""Game of the Year"" but I knock it down 1/2 star (amazon doesn't let 1/2 stars so it was either 4 or 5 which it's not a 5 because only a few games are). It's the fighting mechanics that I have an issue with. First off the combat which is 25% of the game (story, exploration, crafting/shopping/alchemy take up the other 75%) makes me want to throw the controller at the TV. There is no way to quickly disengage the enemy and run away. Each enemy you fight, you're automatically zeroed in on them and face them at all times thus preventing you from turning around and jumping over anything. Also the archers in this game would make Errol Flynn envious. The arrows don't miss and can hit you from many horse trots away. Just when you think it's safe, bammm, you get hit with an arrow you have no idea how the archer hit/seen you through trees or brushes. Those are the only issues I have with the fighting but they have caused me many of deaths. Also the interface with the crafting, comparing items is causing me headaches. Skyrim had a great interface that made reading everything so easy, this game I'm constantly having to get out of the Merchant's shop menu, enter my own inventory to compare what I have to what I wish to buy only to re-enter the Merchant's shop menu to make a decision. One last issue I have, I should be able to choose an option to see all current open Quest so if I happen to be in an area that has an open Quest I can complete it and more on. Entering the map menu then scrolling to quest and clicking each one until I happen to stumble across a quest in the area I'm currently in is getting very tedious.  Besides from these issues, which are minor annoyances that I've learned to deal with this is a great game and will keep me busy until the next Skyrim comes out. I'm currently playing on the 3rd difficulty which I'm finding the fights too easy anyway so I may have to ramp it up another notch to make it even harder. Currently level 10 and loving every minute of the game.  ***Update 6/16/15*** Currently level 20 and both my son and I are totally in agreement. Skyrim this is not. What we miss...No house to own. No place to store items you may want to keep. Either you must sell it or keep it in your current inventory. You can get hit by rock trolls, monsters and a whole bunch of different creatures without getting hurt, but if you fall from 10 feet you die??? Maybe he has bad knees. lol Also Skyrim's swords were graphically done great. Flames would be coming out of some or each element that was equipped with the sword was made apparent to be stored on your trophy case in your house...The Witcher, it's just a plain sword with no emotional attachment to it or how you obtained it.  Also I'm leveling up too fast. I still have level 4 or 6 quest I have yet to complete that I'm trying to do now. The steel sword serves no purpose. Humans are so easy to kill. Fine the Witcher swords and the game is a joke. Every higher level enemy I face (even 32) I'm able to kill with not much of an effort. The Quen (shield) makes the game way toooo easy.  My son is actually almost finished the game and he's starting to play Elder scrolls on-line instead of the Witcher just proving that he's not too much into it. Myself, I'm just finding all the question marks and getting the treasure. But I can't see myself playing this game as much as Skyrim.  ***Update 6/22/15*** My son hasn't picked up this game since playing Elder Scrolls. I dropped this game down to 3 stars cause I'm done enjoying it.  I just want it to be over and never see it again. Why can't I jump in knee high water, or climb myself up a thick sheet of ice in knee high water??? Also the quest Isle of Mists you must reach by boat. My boat was destroyed half way there so I swam the rest of the way. (took me 5 minutes) but the quest can't continue because you have to reach this isle by boat??? Skyrim had the Brotherhood story line, thief's guild story line, the mage story line that made you want to become a leader of those guilds which required so much time and finishing tons of question. The only story line I find fun are the boxing matches which I completed already. I'm tired of killing monsters (I'm level 26 and I haven't met a single monster I can't defeat even level 39. My difficulty setting is still above normal. Had such high hopes once I started playing, but lost interest too easy.  Like Destiny which was soooo bad...

2789,56611,4,False,"08 14, 2004",ACDME82WBJDTZ,B000271MCG,V. Holliday,"Missing: Since January is a cleverly conceived game. The designer, Lexis Numerique, has figured out a way to immerse players with story, in a way that other adventure games simply do not. The conceit is that the abducted couple's employer, SKL Network, has widely dispersed a CD-ROM from the abductor in an effort to hasten their return. Gameplay begins, then, when you insert the CD into your drive. It's up to you, of course, whether you will submit to this narrative device-but for its part, the game makes it very easy to do so. The CD itself is nested inside the story. Missing nests its full motion video within the story as well. Using video in an adventure game is a dicey matter. But here, the video is itself being provided to you, the player, by the killer himself. The video of Jack and Karen is multiply coded: it starts out as their documentary record of an investigation, the audience of which they think will be ordinary viewers back home. The video then passes to the hands of the killer who then presents it to you as a way of teasing you. Because of the killer's presence, the video takes on an eerie quality that would simply be lost without this multiple embedding. At the same time, Jack and Karen's documentary presentation, as they intended it to be, is oddly comforting.  About a month or so before Missing was released, The Adventure Company sent out an email (to folks signed up to receive them) that was in truth a promotion for the game, but presented itself as an announcement of the couple's abduction. The Adventure Company was attempting, in other words, to begin the immersion early, as a way of drumming up excitement and interest in the game. The subject line was ""Missing,"" and the text of the email described Jack Lorski and Karen Gijman's capture, as well as asking for people's help. I don't know if the email garnered interest-I myself was vaguely impressed-but I do know that about 3 days later I got another email from The Adventure Company apologizing for the confusion and explaining clearly that the previous email was merely a promotion for the new game. Interest or not, more than just a few people apparently believed the email was real. This unfortunate incident is a testament to the game's immersive quality.  As many adventure gamers know, acting can absolutely make or break a game. In most adventure games, voice acting is the only component, but in Missing acting is especially critical, because you both see and hear the abducted couple. I suppose I have played enough games where even the voice acting was virtually intolerable; consequently, I imagine I have low expectations. But I am suitably impressed with the acting in Missing, whereas many reviewers have remarked that the acting is mostly just adequate if at moments hokey. What few reviewers have failed to mention is the back story of Jack and Karen's evolving love affair. What may appear hokey is in fact an attempt to develop the emotionality of this storyline. I for one liked it, and I did not feel that it was overdone. And the actors do a fine job of playing to the camera. After all, at any given time, the camera is looking at the person for whom the camera operator is growing to care. This camera work, with one notable exception (Karen and Jack appear together in one scene, so who is shooting the film?), is expertly conceived and directed. Actress Caroline Charlty establishes her relationship to the camera (which is in effect Jack's eye, always looking at her) very well. Actor Olivier Chenevat is a serious, focused Jack Lorski, and while he smiles only once through the whole game, I found his Jack to be remarkably sympathetic. When Karen (the camera) looks at him, he is quietly self-conscious. I enjoyed the romantic development; it gave depth to the embedded terror inherent in the killer's presentation of the video and consequently raised the tension a notch. If you like complicated stories in your games, Missing will work for you.  However, if you like consistently meaningful and well conceived puzzles, you may be a little disappointed. Other reviewers have rightly and adequately pointed to the problems with the puzzles in this game. The game pays homage to Pac Man and Space Invaders, and while I was alive and old enough to play both those games to death when they first came out, I didn't think much of their presentation here. The Space Invaders game is so annoying and meaninglessly difficult that I had a notion to send somebody an ugly email at The Adventure Company. The idea, it seems, with these puzzles is that they are generated by the mind of a psychotic, sinister, sadistic killer, and so the more tedious and meaningless they can at times be the better. This device just doesn't work. If you're a purist-you don't do walkthroughs-you will, even if you are an adroit puzzle solver, pixel hunter, and mouse maneuverer, be incredibly aggravated. I for one am not too proud to seek answers in such a cowardly way, and consequently I saved myself an enormous amount of frustration.  I just finished the game a short while ago, and as I write I am still receiving emails about the story development. No doubt, Missing invites a sequel, and I am fine with that. In spite of the astonishingly annoying puzzles and the admittedly anemic ending, I am completely occupied with the multiple storylines in this game. Very little narrative tension is resolved here, but that in itself is interesting and engaging. What works so amazingly well are the lessons learned from the reality and documentary genres. If the interactive element at times fails, and it does, the story nonetheless retains its integrity. I give Missing 4 stars for its creative concept, film/video production values, and its remarkable narrative. I can give it no more than 4 stars for its at times silly puzzles and unnecessary and ill-placed frustrations.",I'll play the sequel,1092441600,15.0,,,player puzzle reviewer save jack focused anemic lorski romantic come start player lesson resolve fine fails value pixel presentation remarkably time problem insert submit many ordinary solver invader later impressed-but actor star affair write expertly emotionality point pac part viewer annoy retains notable home documentary eerie couple meaningful generate couple's january complicate attempt would investigation learn sadistic hear excitement adequate ago amazingly work immerse audience lexis difficult tedious relationship idea release text presence enjoy finish gameplay without maneuverer believe device cleverly eye ugly return killer proud may suitably actress camera know give send notch consequently clearly designer much person effort olivier amount drive embed overdone confusion like adequately element nest development puzzle concept interest-i employer charlty network within engage storyline serious caroline quietly chenevat well jack's hasten one depth death love new whole company seek meaninglessly direct coded smile day effect immersion first enormous unnecessary help time sinister describe imagine alive conceit cd game karen's still voice see inside establishes story game's scene terror play appear whereas walkthroughs-you since cd-rom story doubt old attempting take merely use always give begin numerique expectation film dicey give abduct astonishingly actor inherent virtually evolve play testament component work break end conceive however drum simply interest multiply receive grow think reality meaningless job receive folk enough comfort occupy seem raise hand suppose promotion invite genre find unfortunate interesting little homage silly course like back quality sign vaguely spite karen low purist-you acting adventure killer's consistently disperse intolerable whether game early mind get mostly mouse truth aggravate integrity sequel ill-placed cowardly man send provide make narrative capture word incredibly present garner critical previous tension gijman's motion well another pass apologize incident look hunter care rightly look email explain month apparently email ask way admittedly space abductor present completely moment shoot impressed notion video tease frustration skl multiple disappointed storyline somebody creative feel real begin answer line operator record fact play frustration miss psychotic subject gamers film/video announcement develop exception lose remark together hokey pay full intend interactive fail especially embed adroit device-but sympathetic self-conscious production figure even matter easy immersive short widely people's mention make nested people nonetheless remarkable oddly abduction absolutely
2790,11527,5,False,"05 20, 2002",A2RHBT46LS6DA3,B000035Y6N,Ryk E. Spoor,"Chrono Trigger remains the greatest console RPG ever made. The version on this new CD compilation is identical in play to the original, but includes several animated cutscenes (done by Bird Studios, producers of Dragonball/DBZ and owned/operated by Akira Toriyama, who did the character designs for Chrono Trigger as well) which are themselves worth the price. (In point of fact, the price itself is interesting; the compilation of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 costs less than either of them did separately when first released.) Chrono Trigger centers around the adventures of Crono (yes, that's the correct spelling), a young man whose only apparent unusual feature is skill with a sword; otherwise, he lives a rather ordinary life, getting his allowance from his mom, taking care of his pet cat, and, as the story begins, looking forward to the Millennial Fair. At the Fair, he meets with a pretty blonde girl, Marle, who wears an interesting pendant, and who as a stranger to his town asks him if he'd be nice enough to show her around a bit. Things get strange when they visit the exhibit area of one of Crono's friends, Lucca, who's an eccentric inventor. Her invention mysteriously reacts to the presence of Marle's pendant, and Marle vanishes, leaving the glowing pendant behind. When Crono decides to follow her wherever she's gone and bring her back, he's catapulted into a time-spanning adventure which will take him from the present to 65 million years in the past, and thousands of years in the future, and eventually to confront a world-destroying monster which may, at the same time, have been responsible for the creation of Crono's own civilization. Along the way he will learn secrets of his world's history, gain new powers, and gather allies, ranging from the super-strong cavegirl Ayla to the technologically advanced machine-man Robo. Chrono Trigger's greatest claim to fame was, and is, that it boasts many possible endings, all quite different, based on what decisions you make during the game. They're not all easily predictable, either, and at least one or two are rather creepy. It's also interesting in that, after a certain point, you no longer have to keep Crono in your party (most games have a set viewpoint character that you have to keep around). It's quite possible to finish the game with *ANY* combination of available characters. Gameplay is, in my opinion, superior to that of any of the Final Fantasy games. For one thing, it avoids the ""eternally wandering monster"" phenomenon which makes overland travel in the FF series so damnably frustrating, while still allowing you to wander freely across the land and visit places, looking for clues, new things to buy, and new friends and allies. For another, the combat sequences are much more active than those of other RPGs of its same era, and include special techniques -- both for individuals AND ones combining the techniques of two or three characters at once. Once you beat the game, you have the option of using ""new game+"", which allows you to start with the same power, and most of the items, that you'd gained along the way the first time. This is useful for those trying to play through again, since it allows you to zip through combats which, the first time, took many minutes to complete. (it does, however, introduce a bit of cognitive dissonance, especially in the early parts of the game: ""How the heck are they throwing ME in jail?! I have enough power to level this entire CASTLE by myself!"") The soundtrack of Chrono Trigger is unbelieveably good. Somehow, through the miracle of MIDI, the original game had 3 full CDs worth of music crammed on it, and the skill with which the MIDI was composed and produced made it sound, at the time, very nearly orchestral. Even today the sound isn't bad, and the re-done, fully orchestral version is amazing. Each major character has its own theme, and they're all excellent. Chrono Trigger's soundtrack still rates as one of my absolute favorites. If you like console RPGs at all, this is one that you absolutely MUST buy, and keep enshrined somewhere.

They sprang from the ashes of the company that created FALLOUT, and they've been living in the shadows ever since. If you look at their track record, every single one of their games have been sequels to some of the most highly-acclaimed RPGs of all time. They always have huge shoes to fill, and the results have always been a mixed bag.  My favorite game is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Knights-of-the-Old-Republic/dp/B000067DPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</a>&nbsp;for many reasons. It was my first experience with a game where my actions actually mattered, where I could interact with the characters of that world, and where I could actually roleplay. As soon as I finished it, I went out and bought the sequel:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Knights-of-the-Old-Republic-II-The-Sith-Lords/dp/B0002B90SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a>. I really didn't know what I had played. It was a game that was so tedious to play at times, but actually managed to improve on the formula I had thought was perfect. Obsidian hasn't broken that habit; they always progress the state of RPGs in their own way, but that accomplishment is always hidden beneath layers of glitches and faulty gameplay.  ALPHA PROTOCOL really is no different. Though it represents the company's first attempt at making an original I.P. that's entirely their own, they made the mistake of allowing it to be compared to the MASS EFFECT series, games that are known for their quality, gameplay, and story. If you're looking for an experience similar to that of MASS EFFECT, you really won't find it here. But what you will find, oddly enough, is a game that manages to pull off a few tricks that guys at BioWare should really take note of in the future.  The story of ALPHA PROTOCOL is sort of clever when you get right down to it, but it is almost one of the most convoluted I've ever played. You take on the role of Agent Michael Thorton, a man who has just been drafted into a top secret branch of U.S. intelligence called Alpha Protocol. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, requires you to investigate the circumstances of a terrorist act against a passenger airliner. This story will take you to Saudi Arabia, Rome, Taipei, and Moscow, all the while making decisions that will affect how the story unfolds.  Now, this is the really amazing part of the game. Unlike MASS EFFECT, where all your decisions really end up doing is change the ending, the decisions you make in ALPHA PROTOCOL decide how the entire story unfolds. Depending on who you save or kill, how you behave in a mission, who you choose to form alliances with: it all impacts how the story plays out. Sidequests will open and close. Some romance options won't even appear. The way people talk to you will change depending on how you've treated them. Maybe the overall story arc doesn't change very much, but how it unfolds certainly does, and by wide margins.  Though you will have to play as Michael Thorton (there's hardly any customization available, nor is there an option to play as a female agent), the story managed to become very involving the more my choices began to come into play. The times when you interact with the other characters (all of them are very well written and voiced) are the highlights in the game. Heck, it almost blows MASS EFFECT out of the water in that regard, but that still doesn't change the fact that there is still a game that you have to play to get to those parts, and that's, unfortunately, where ALPHA PROTOCOL founders.  To put it bluntly, the gameplay is terrible. It's nothing special in the least bit. It's as if Obsidian was trying to blend GEARS OF WAR, SPLINTER CELL, and MASS EFFECT mechanics into the same game, but they didn't succeed in making any of it work to the point where it's fun. The gunplay is based upon your level, so if you try shooting people with a pistol and you don't have any ranks in it, you can be at point blank range and STILL miss your enemy. I had all of my points into that skill, and by the end of the game most of the enemies were still dodging bullets and brushing off those that actually hit them. You never really feel like you've gotten any more talented than when you started.  Not to mention this is only exacerbated by terrible enemy AI. Guards will take cover and never pop out again, some will always charge you no matter how much damage they're taking, and some will just blow themselves up. Also, every single enemy in this game has grenades on their person (not an exaggeration), so expect to be hit with some of those if you take cover for too long.  Despite being labeled ""The Espionage RPG,"" this game does not really allow you to live out your spy fantasies. Ninety percent of all the missions in this game revolve around shooting guards in different ways. It doesn't matter what your overall objective is; there is no option to smooth talk your way through any of them like James Bond would do, nor can you effectively stealth through them like Sam Fisher would do. You will always be running and gunning, no matter what class you choose. It's like playing the same level over and over again for over ten hours.  The funny thing is, though I can fault this game in so many ways, I would buy a sequel on the first day. The game needs improvement, that's a given, but Obsidian have made an attempt to progress modern RPGs. They've made a game that changes based on your decisions, instead of giving you the illusion of change (ala MASS EFFECT). The characters are great, witty, very likable, and the thought of a proper spy-based RPG is something I never knew I wanted so badly until I had played ALPHA PROTOCOL.  The potential in this series Obsidian have created is astounding. Of course the game didn't sell well - and for good reason; I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game - but I would hope that Obsidian decides to give the property another shot somewhere down the line. I would only suggest that they watch CASINO ROYALE, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, and THE BOURNE IDENTITY over and over again, get back to the drawing board, and give their fans the Espionage RPG that they'd promised, but only partially delivered.","Genius Concept, Okay Results",1284508800,3.0,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},,"shadow manage maybe i've spy-based habit republic</a>&nbsp;for romance ever wide faulty actually try time ashes get exaggeration favorite point badly many allow thing certainly blow expect accomplishment reason make fisher different rank impact voice range brush fun charge mechanic really write enemy despite entirely part original right funny layer obsidian point pull blow try convolute soon bluntly they'd kill bit bourne almost guard miss i.p attempt would dodge blank blend potential sprang choice water hit is&nbsp;<a tedious pistol hide mattered sidequests experience broken special run overall finish gameplay customization call board mass note they're every know mistake give trick mixed agent label female much person margin think character they've like heck rome level way could start come take branch open grenade property nothing affect modern lords</a sell state involve long unfortunately hope suggest upon one role change future make option revolve sam company draft terrorist passenger company's become first effect ten time live accept top give damage buy identity game also talk pay still proper mission choose create need appear play gear since decision story old protocol though impossible there's ninety allow always war u.s save manages spy give formula roleplay play action work end knight alpha ala recommend mission hour decide fantasy likable clever know war least enough gunning secret take change regard michael act espionage want fan go circumstance huge play beneath behave course series entire quality back improvement highlight illusion similar enemy exacerbate good single james terrible bullet game watch draw royale entertainment part begin close sequel fault succeed form class=""a-link-normal man investigate buy make glitch saudi look deliver knew well another effectively founder look arc interact track talented fill sequel:&nbsp;<a fallout pop option find shot way smooth percent result splinter depend require sequel republic represent rpgs sith world perfect guy objective shoot something great casino amaze feel bioware partially unlike shoe line put witty somewhere record that's bag airliner fact play unfolds taipei compare thorton ii live reason intelligence bond hardly price full cell sort improve gunplay promise even stealth data-hook=""product-link-linked moscow matter easy day skill treat rpg never class astound get around progress instead cover mention end arabia people alliance oddly available decide base highly-acclaimed ai"

It's a lot of turn-based fighting over-and-over again, watching the characters taking their turns in orderly fashion to hit the bad guys.  If you like that sort of thing, great, but if you don't, it will get old fast. 2) The story and dramatics of the game are pretty corny and occasionally obnoxious. 3) The pacing of the game is pretty awful at times.  There will be very long stretches where you have to make your way through a maze only to be interrupted a dozen times by the same random battle encounter.  There will be very long stretches of long cutscenes.  There will be very long stretches of wandering around for the sake of wandering around. 4) Games where you can't save your progress at will have always seemed mistaken to me, but here there will be maddeningly long spaces between Save points.

I went from thinking this wasn't that scary and sucks to thinking this game is awesome.  First let me say that I used to think that the combat sucked in this game.  But actually it is not bad.  I actually read the instructions (for once) and figured out how it is SUPPOSED to be played.  If you turn off your light and use the charge up on the melee weapons and throw them you can fight off monsters and kill them more effectively.  ESPECIALLY if you turn off your light which adds to the fear because you are in the darkness but also the monsters can't see you.  The music on this game rocks.  This is a good game I think some have been too hard on it.  I'm having fun with it and love it just as much as all the other SH games I own (accept for Homecoming).

2804,445078,4,False,"11 14, 2016",A1EARN5PUVIF1S,B01GWGX836,Jerry P. Danzig,"I have enjoyed other music games on various PS consoles in the past, notably Guitar Hero and Parappa the Rapper, and I thought this dance game might be fun.  I also liked the fact that you don't need a PS Camera to make it work -- any smartphone will do the trick.  Well, up to a point.  The truth is, you hold your smartphone in your right hand, so that's the only input the game uses to give you a score -- do you wave your right hand in time with the music and following the movement patterns of the animated dancer onscreen?  This means that I have been able to get good and even perfect scores on some passages without even moving my feet!  Unfortunately, unless you have a phone case with a wrist strap (I assume such things exist these days, don't they?), your phone is likely to go flying at some point if you really start putting some energy into your moves.  I thought of all the times Wi users were accidentally throwing their motion controllers at their flat-screen TVs...  So you probably wouldn't want to use your new multi-hundred-dollar iPhone for Just Dance, and you probably want to stand well away from your multi-thousand-dollar curved-screen ultra-high-def TV!  (You can also use a PS Move controller, but like the PS Camera, that entails an extra expense.)  Another problem I encountered early on playing this game -- phone users get only three brief lines of instruction on setting up the smartphone connection.  As someone who has never used a QR scanner, I had no idea how to get my phone to scan the code on the screen!  Are smartphone kids today born with this knowledge?  Perhaps so.  But a line of instruction saying, ""You will need to download a FREE QR scanner program from your phone store"" would have been useful and minimized my frustration as a new user.  I also had a little trouble figuring out how to quit the JD app on my Android phone.  Aah, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen, causing the triangle, circle, and square buttons to appear...  On the positive side, there are several quirky modes in this game, which has a very goofy Japanese feel, like Parappa.  In one mode, you dance to help some aliens re-energize their ship.  In another, you play in a live hookup with other dancers online.  In a third, a so-called Quest mode, you dance to several music tracks, themed around things like snacks.  Mm -- okay, whatever floats your boat, I guess...  At any rate, this game would likely be particularly fun when you have some friends over to party.  A little smoke, a little drink, and you bust out your moves!  The animations are eye-catching and colorful and should intrigue even party attendees who aren't dancing.  As for the music included with the game, it's pretty standard dance-floor stuff.  Kind of disco-y for the most part.  I'd prefer some classic rock & roll selections myself...

2810,83839,5,False,"03 12, 2010",A24O6U575872K1,B000FQ2DTA,B. Mills,"-NO SPOILERS-  First things first, before you play this game at all you have to do one thing: go to settings and change the default from ""auto-battle"" to ""abilities"".  This is really necessary if you want to feel like your playing the game, not that the game is playing you.  You still have the ability to choose auto-battle, which can be a decent option if you want to save yourself the annoyance of pushing x needlessly in easier battles, and unfortunately your battle options are limited enough in the beginning, when your learning the battle system, that you will get bad habits and won't enjoy the game later on, because, when do right the battle system is IMMENSELY FUN!  Sometimes auto-battle and picking your actions will result in the same choices, but the key to battles is TIMING, and after some experience you will get a feel for the how quickly the action bar will refill, and once you learn that you  can click through the selections of, which action, which target, etc, in a rhythmic pattern to get the exact right timing.  The feeling of attacking your enemy exactly when he's about to strike and and interrupting him, or using an area affect RIGHT when the enemy pulls back into the crowd, never fails to satisfy.  But if you just click though your options as quickly as possible, you will miss of waste your attacks and take allot more damage.  There's allot more going on in these battles then pretty animations (though they are gorgeous)  Now, I am no where near the end of this massive game, but I waited until I was far enough into the game until I had decided weather I was sold on the games unique aspects, or not.  As it says in  the title of this review this is NOT your fathers (or mother's, lets be fair) final fantasy.  There's no towns, though there is shopping, this I didn't think would bother me because the part I always hate about jrpg's is wondering around aimlessly in town x... and the game is linear especially in the beginning.  I'll be honest with you, at first this feels, weird, and it certainly took me a while to get comfortable with it.  But something happened around hour three for me; I started to get immersed in the story.  They did a great job not giving you any idea what the heck is going on, which for me causes an insatiable desire to play further, and then suddenly you completely engrossed in tis story, you've nailed down the combat and suddenly you no longer even notice how different it is, until you realize, that actually the way in which they allowed the game to unfold was a perfect way to introduce the characters to you.  This isn't the main character driven story of games like FF7, and as a result it would be hard to create a player attachment to this motley crew in any other way.  I'm not saying that you'll love this though, if you want the main character focuses story and traditional game-play with no exceptions, don't bother. But if your main draw to these games is story, and really feeling like your guiding an epic tale towards its ending while mastering a new and unique battle system (which has always been my thing) then you will like this game.  Great story or not, it can take it a little bit out of your hands with the CG, and I wish i had a little bit more control over EVERY character in my party, so I give it a fun factor of 4, but it must be recognized that visually this game is ridiculous, CG AND in game will blow you away, and the audio is absolutely top notch, one of the best IMO, so I bumped it up to 5... however if you don't have a HD TV or surround sound, this won't have mcuh effect on you will it?  So, great game, not traditional, but I have been much more sold on this new approach then some other's out there, so if you anything like me, I would definitely give it a try or you'll be missing out on a great story (one of the better FF stories IMO, much better than 10) and addictive game.  EDIT:  My score still stands, but as I am close to 20 hours in to this game (you get your money's worth) I want to note a couple of things I have noticed.  First, I have encountered one instance (although only one) where the linearity of the game felt broken.  Without giving away spoiler's I will just say that one might get into trouble if they specialize their character's too much because the game insists on switching up you battle-group, and even changing its numbers, and so one day you will NEED to use Lightning as a MEDIC.  It doesn't seem logical when she can be such a better, anything else basically. Since the game is linear it means there isn't the same opurtunity for grinding, so if you get stuck, what you have to do is go backwards and use old enemies instead, but this gets highly repetitive.  However this incident made me realize two things that I felt people should know before getting, or starting this game: you will basically max out everything eventually, there IS NOT like the materia system in FF 7 where the player decides what to focus on. On the PLUS side, all the none combat moves of each class work ALL the time, so +10 hp for MEDIC and +10 to Commando will work for that character no matter what class he/she is.  This is a very positive thing, which for some reason didn't occur to me right away, I don't know why.  The result is that you best advice, and really only advice, is to pursue everything in a fairly balanced manner, with a little bit of room for personal choice about what you acquire first, but at the end of the day it will be a wash, you will get everything.  On one hand this means, you don't get to craft your characters to your will like in other FF games, but it also allows for a lot of satisfaction for every single thing you unlock.  Also if you know this before hand, unlike me, it means that the player will always be ready for what comes next.  At the end of the day this is all part of the more linear approach to the game that I mentioned before but didn't initially realize this aspect to it.  The dev's designed it so they could be relatively assured that they new your capabilities at every point in the game as design it accordingly.  As i mentioned above this only broke once for me and it was slightly my own fault for trying to force specialization on a system which doesn't really allow for it.  The conclusion is the same as before though, this is part of makes the gmae hgighly addictive, whcih isn't unusual for FF games, but at the same time allows for the story (which continues to impress) to unfold rather quickly, which is a bit unusual.  The result is addictive and rewarding, provided you accept that you aren't in control of certain aspects of the game, although I still insist that in the actual battles, their is great room for skill and technique, and the dev's added a score system to rate you each time which is a nice little recognition of your continued efforts to master the game.  HOWEVER, as a contrast to the more restrictive aspects mentioned above, the ability to actually level up your equipment and weapons is a very nice, and player centered aspect of this game which I am quite happy they added.  It really adds something to the whole, leveling-up aspect of the game, and provides a further reward to each battle.  BTW, Cedit Chips ARE NOT for upgrades they are for SELLING, be careful of that!  Sometimes the yforget to explain certain things, but its much preferred to the mountains of text regarding EVERYTHING that one had to read in previous iterations of Final Fantasy (cough 10 cough)  Well, not much else to say than I am about to play some more!

Let's just do a simple good vs bad list. GOOD:  - Shooting: The shooting in this game feels EXCELLENT, regardless of anything else the shooting mechanics are solid and fun.  - Varied enemy races: Each race feels different not just in looks but in combat as well, the Fallen feel like your generic FPS bad guys, the Hive feel more Numbers > Strength, the Vex have very much the mechanical feel you'd expect from them with things like teleportation and not having the standard ""No head = dead"" flaw, and the Cabal do feel like the Tanks with tons of armour and power.  - Visuals: The game world looks beautiful and some of the areas are good enough that you can just sit down and enjoy them. The game does lack things like water reflections and zero environmental destructibility, but that's more of a gripe as a modern gamer rather than an actual drawback for the game.  - Early leveling: You can't deny that the first 1-10 level ups you get are exciting and fun, you get powers that genuinely make your feel badass, new abilities that you'll love trying out and access to more and more weapons and armour.  BAD:  - The story: almost entirely non-existant. While there are several ""Story missions"" very few of them actually provide you with any knowledge. My whole time on Earth i think i found out that there are some bad guys called the Fallen and the Hive, i was dead, fighting for Earth is a lost cause, that's pretty much it as far as story, beyond that i found out there's a computer program who has absolutely no bearing on the story, the Fallen have big spider tanks...yay? And the Hive are on the Moon, a place i was going any way.  - The Loot: completely random! I have completed the story and i got more powerful weapons re-doing the first level than i did from defeating the final Boss, armour i obtained from a level 4 petrol mission was better than armour i got from a 45 minute, level 18, grind-fest ""Strike Mission""  - Matchmaking: For a game about being a ""connected world"" only one game mode has Matchmaking capabilities, for everything else you have to bring your own friends, assuming you have enough friends who all have the same game, on the same console, who want to do the same mission, who are all available at the same time. The....HELL?!  - Level setup: So let me just explain how 98.72% of your missions are going to be resolved. You'll find a console or a blocked doorway, your Ghost will try to unlock it but would you believe it the enemy are suddenly here...for no reason, so you'll hold off wave after wave of pre-determined enemies while miraculously it takes your Ghost exactly the amount of time it takes to kill all the enemies to unlock the door. Now replace who the enemy is and then which door/console you're hacking and that is the game....that's it. The only other mission type is ""kill this guy"".  - Enemy types: while the individual races are different, within them it becomes painfully boring. Apart from the Thralls from the Hive most enemy types are the same only with a) more health and/or b) a regenerating shield that will make you want to snap your PS4 in half.  - Bosses: The single most boring part of this game, instead of making new or interesting ways to defeat them (See Sargus Ruk from the game Warframe or Mr Freeze from Arhkam City). All bosses are just bullet sponges with ridiculous weapons, you can easily spend over an hour pouring bullets into a Boss and barely make a dent, even when you have friends all using their ""Heavy Weapons"" you'll just want to cry. Instead of feeling relief at the end of a Boss battle you just wish you'd never started.  That's the long and short of it, this game could be so much more if it either put more into the story or allow matchmaking on all game modes.

Docking a star from the G920 because the brake pedal is ridiculous. Somebody at Logitech had the bright idea to stick a rubber block in the brake pedal shaft that basically makes pushing the brakes down impossible. Most games you'll need to use the same force as Crocodile's mouth to get 100% brake force unless you're willing to open up the G920 pedals and remove the stupid rubber block (and most likely, voiding your warranty in the process.) Some really should be fired for that decision.  Brake pedal aside, it's a great wheel! I haven't bought a new wheel since my old Logitech Driving Force Pro in the PS2 days with GranTurismo 3 and 4.

2835,277661,5,False,"08 5, 2012",ADLVFFE4VBT8,B0091I20E6,Cthulhu,"The G600 is the mouse a gamer (and probably only a gamer) would love. My son is a gamer and he loves it. According to him, the G600 would be the absolute best, perfect gaming mouse he could imagine IF 'wireless' was an option as it is in the more versatile G700.  Let me begin with features that would make some not to want a G600 with the understanding that many gamers would not be bothered by these or even view some as positives.  - MOUSE MOVEMENT issues - If you click to fast, something that DOES happen while gaming, the pointer quickly jumps across the screen instead of registering the click. This is annoying and, depending one what you are playing it can mean 'death' to you. See my note below on how I believe I was able to solve this. - WIRED only - The wire is braided which makes tangles less likely but it's a wire nevertheless. Gaming mice as a class tend to require more power than regular ones and you don't want your mouse to give up on you while playing but it would have been nice if the G600 was configured as wired/wireless. The G700 is that way but it comes with much fewer buttons. - THREE-BUTTON mouse - By default you have the right-click, the left-click and the G-shift (alternate settings for all configurable buttons). It takes some getting used to it before you learn how not to press the G-shift and my kid simply assigned the G-shift button to something else and moved the G-shift function to a different button. - NO THUMB REST - My G700 is shaped in a way that allows my thumb to rest when not pushing a button. You don't have this on the G600 because the 12 side buttons take all the space. Again, it takes some getting used to and I know that my kid no longer minds this. He believes that having 12 buttons at his thumb-tip is worth it. - RIGHT-HANDED ONLY - The side buttons are meant to use with your thumb so there's no way you can use it efficiently if you are left-handed. I don't know if they make a left-handed version. - IT'S WHITE - Logitech sells the exact same mouse in black but you'll have to pay more. A black mouse tends to look cooler but most gamers don't show their mice around so it doesn't really matter and I would not pay more for the black version.  And, now, for the good things:  + TWENTY BUTTONS - This is huge. For comparison, my G700 has 4 thumb-buttons vs. 12 on the G600. Add to this the G-shift function which doubles the amount of configured buttons and you should be okay no matter what game you may be playing. + LOTS OF PROFILES - The mouse itself can store up to three profiles in its own memory but once you install Logitech's software you can store many, many more on your computer and load them as you need them. + DISCOVERABLE GAMES - Logitech's software scans your computer and if it has a preset profile for any of the games you have installed you will be able to use it. I see that they keep adding more profiles as they create them. + CREATE YOUR OWN PROFILES - Not surprisingly, you can create you own and you can store them either in G600's internal memory or on your computer. + CUSTOMIZABLE - And it's almost to the point where you find that it's too much. Just about everything can be changed: mouse operating parameters, keys assignments, the buttons color (set differently for different profiles), the 'mode' as in 'gaming' vs other uses and so forth.  In the end, no matter how well a product performs, the questions anyone is probably asking are: 'do I need it?' and 'is it worth it'? For anyone who is not a dedicated gamer, the answer should be 'no' and 'no' for some or all the reasons I listed in the 'issues' section above. Casual PC gamers like myself are likely to find that the G700 is the ideal pick because it can perform reasonably well as a gaming mouse and it's one of the best mice overall I know. If you ARE a gamer and are willing to spend some time getting used to it then the G600 is very much 'it' unless you are willing to spend a lot more. It allows you to set (or download) separate profiles for every single game you play, assign dozens of macros of keystrokes per profile, instantly recognize the profiles you are playing because you can set your buttons colors that way. The 'jumping cursor' bug was extremely annoying but I seem to have found the fix at least for Windows 7.  Even though I won't be using the G600 myself and I would not buy one for me, I will be granting it five stars because my kid who, as a gamer, is the intended user does use it and he loves it.  ________________________________________________________  NOTE: I was able to compile an executable that appears to be addressing the jumping cursor bug.

Overall it seems like it could have been better, but whoever wrote the story for this just slaughtered any chance of that. The main character sounded like a full grown man trying to talk like a baby? It was sickening. And the story line didn't seem to make any sense to me. It seems like this game was supposed to be humorous, but like the other reviewers said, it was just extremely annoying. If you could get this game for free, or for one dollar, and you had absolutely nothing else to do, then i'd say go for it.

2844,47794,4,False,"12 1, 2005",ACTMZJ4EUOC65,B00009WNZA,Teahouse Fox,"The game has introduced all new game-play features that change everything about how your sims function.  Aspirations are now as important as Needs, and many of them are dependent on interaction with the other sims.  With a broad nod to family relationships, the Sims 2 allows some basic family ties to be created along with your manually generated sims, and the relationships that occur during in-game sim creation - aka where little sims come from - will be automatic.  You can create an extended family the easy way - create grandparents, their adult children, and their children (maximum of 8 in one household), and wind up with the full gamut of cousins, aunts/uncles, grandparents, etc. You can also do it the hard way, starting with a sim, finding their lifemate and get down to having a multi-generational extended family as part of the game. Both ways are both challenging and fun for different reasons.  Features that were only available after many many add ons for the original Sims are available in the core game for The Sims2, and that's a welcome change.  Some of the drawbacks are that there are bugs in the game which the 'support' staff generally attribute to users using 3rd party mods - even when they haven't. Actual support is rather spotty in that aspect as a result, and few patches are available.  The generational aspect to the gameplay makes the standard support response to delete all your game files and start over seem a little harsh.  The game does tax older systems. Actually, it can tax newer ones as well, particularly in a household with a lot of objects, a lot of sims and a party goin on!  My suggestion for those scratching for disk space and wondering why the game brings their machines to their knees is to play the console version (if that's an option for them) or upgrade their machines if it's that important.  Oh - and if you have a DVD drive, get the DVD copy of the game. Who needs all those cds?  Most updates you will get will be available on the expansion pack CDs (no DVD expansion media). Most expansion packs (EP) will require that you back up your game files, since if you decide to uninstall the EP, your games won't be compatible anymore.  Better to have a copy of your ""/Documents and Settings/My Documents/EA Games"" folder to fall back on if you need to uninstall a expansion.  Got a new computer? Don't worry - install The Sims 2 on your new system, and all the expansion packs and custom content then copy your EA Games folder to My Documents on your new system. All your sims, houses, and neighborhoods come along for the ride, just the way you left them.  There are both true Expansion Packs, and Stuff Packs available. The EPs give you the most bang for your buck, adding new neighborhoods, careers, objects and styles of gameplay and making The Sims 2 the most addictive game I've bought in years.  Notable EPs include University and Seasons.  University gives your sims another life stage to live, and the added benefit of career boosts, and more Aspiration/Wants available. Also things like zombies are introduced.  Seasons is the next, and one of my favorite, allowing sims to go on vacation for fun, honeymooning and adventure. You also get weather - and the need to dress appropriately and use proper roofing! The weather will also affect your sims moods and activities and gardens. Grow your own food for fun, profit and mood/performance boosts!  Finally, go online and download custom content and building tips for your sims from many of the great sites entirely supported by creative fans. artists.  I love this game. I've had the original Sims which seemed to fall into a trap where the expansion packs made the game more cumbersome and annoying. The Sims 2 happily only adds new dimensions and fun without making the game seem more like work.

Syphon Filter 2 continues the great gameplay its predecessor set up while adding a few twists, such as playing as Lian, having help from other characters during missions (Teresa (a great addition), Chance, etc.), and the two-player mode. If you like exciting, fast-paced games, you will not be disappointed by SF or SF2. I beat SF2 in less time than it took to beat the first one, but that's probably just because I'm farther up the learning curve of the games now. This one delivers challenge (enemies can now use snipers on you and take you out with a head shot!) and plenty of plot twists, right up until the very end. The two-player mode is nice, though the screen should have been split horizontally instead of vertically (it's quite difficult to tell what is going on around you at times). Basically, the two-player mode feels like a neat mini-game if you happen to have someone sitting around. The levels you play on are not huge or incredibly interesting, and your only objective is to kill the other player. One neat new feature the two-player mode adds, though, is having to look for secrets within the one-player game in order to unlock characters and levels. This and the fast-pace of the game (though about half of the stages require you to stop and think your way through sticky situations -- it is rarely just running and shooting) will make you want to play it again even after you have beaten it (plus unlocking all of the secret movies by playing through hard mode).

Boy was it waste of my 6$.  I'm not really much of a stickler for graphics but I will say the games graphics were decent. In terms of presentation, this game fails at everything environment-wise. To go into the previous statement a little further, I will say that the games environments are all VERY shallow and lacking in creativity. I can't tell you how many times I saw the exact same dull environment design throughout my limited playthrough.  The subject of gameplay is the sole reason why I gave this game 2 stars. Devil May Cry debuted on the PS2 in 2001 with hack and slash gameplay that was engaging, deep, and rewarding. Fast-forward to close to the end of 2002 and we have Shinobi; a game with an inexcusable extreme lack of depth and repetitive soulless gameplay.  I can't tell you how fast this game bored me with the SAME 1-2-3 combo combination; Unlike Devil May Cry, you can't vary your slashes or work your projectile weapon into your ""combo."" I could even accept that the sword constantly drained my health as I idled, but that fact added nothing in terms of feelings of tension or incentive to keep playing. In addition, it was kind of cool to pull of those multiple kills at first, but after I did it the 20th time in one level, that feeling of excitement lost its luster FAST.  Now, I played about 6 levels, but after that I could go no more. I must again reaffirm it has NOTHING to do with difficulty, but this gameplay just led me to keep asking myself, ""..so does it ever get deeper? Does he get newer abilities as he progresses? Does it EVER...?"" and it hit me like a rock when I realized the answers to all my questions was this: NO.  It's for this very fact alone that I really don't think I'll ever beat this game.  And that's it, a very short review for a very narrow game. So, as a recap for interested parties, this title is for those who don't notice gameplay that never varies and never gets deeper as well as those simple minded enough to be wowed by 60fps graphics.

An FPS that doesn't play like one, and the HP system behaves similar to WOW or the Destiny campaign HP system. (lots of shots needed for the typical kill)  It is not entirely balanced. But this is not exactly a regular FPS, and the less balanced classes like healers (which die easily) do help the team tremendously.  This game is as if W.O.W. was played from FPS perspective when it comes down to fighting. You need A LOT of hits to kill someone UNLESS you're a character with overpowered special abilities then there will be instant kills (often of nearly the whole enemy team if in the proximity)  There are also those characters which can take an above average beating and survive. (some of which also have the overpowered special abilities...no balance there)  It's a fun game, Works best with a team that know what they are doing, harder to play with randoms, I don't play with friends on PS4 so it's a hit or miss on how good my team is, I'm just glad I got this game on sale.

It turned out to be one of the better buys on games I've had.  You are a British spy who was captured on a mission, but you are set free by a colleague to help save the world.  Basic spy/James Bond feel to the story where you need to go in alone with limited or no backup support.  There is an objective pointer to lead you to your next goal.  Kill some bad guys; collect intel; gather materials to help make time bombs, poison bombs, and lock picks.

You can also shoot off arms, legs, and heads.  There is a feature were you can overturn tables for cover if you wish.  Pretty linear game which you shouldn't get confused on where to go hardly ever.  The length is pretty short, but seems to be par for the course these days.  It's around 10-12 hours to complete.  There is on and offline mulitplayer which is a blast.

I've never gone online to see no games available, but it is usually limited to 2 or 3 eight player games.  Small community of online players.  Beware as well your save file will be a little over 2 megs to save your progress in the game.  Good thing is you don't need it once your done unless you wish to unlock and save ""elite"" difficulty.  You can go online without the save file, but you'll have to input your nickname and select your avatar each time.  Other than those few issues its pretty fun and the multiplayer will keep your entertained for a while with all the different modes: deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF, and a see who can hold the severed head the longest mode.

Until Dawn succeeded, and that speaks to the one thing this game gets right more than any survival horror game around today: its hooks work the whole way through. You want to keep playing through every new development and story twist, which are in ample supply the whole game.  That being said, on a 0-10 scale, I would give this game a strong 8.5 or 9, but cannot give it a ten, so no 5 star rating. But almost.  First of all the graphics are beautiful: the overall aesthetic, the physics, the various environments, the acuity of microexpressions in the characters faces during interactions. I was stunned by the precision of audio-visual quality in this game, and can only hope every game of this genre takes the same degree of care in refining the quality of these elements in their stories going forward.  The story... well, my gut instinct about what was going on between the friends in this story was spot on, and I felt a little disappointed by how predictable it was. Even the story sort of explicitly predicts it for you in character dialogue, so I think a lot of people will find this aspect a little disappointing. At the moment of reveal, it's like, Yeah, I already knew that. That in itself isn't a deal breaker  survival horror games, like horror movies, are often predictable. It doesn't ruin the fun, so I can let that one slide. And truth be told there are moments that make you feel some fright, even though you are 90% certain you know whats going on.  Where I am less forgiving is in respect to the gameplay itself. The marketing of this game cites its ""butterfly effect"" engine, referring to how the most simple of choices determine outcomes for characters. Sometimes these choices are meaningful (e.g. will you point a gun at your friends head or your own?), sometimes they are just plain trivial (e.g. will you throw a snowball at them? Or, will you be sympathetic or argumentative). Some choices just feel silly, and you find yourself wishing there was some other option that is not available. Overall though, this is one of the best written game narratives I have seen in a long time. The characters have depth, and they develop. The environment itself has a deep story and becomes its own rich character. Plus the game seamlessly draws from some of the best acoustic and visual horror movie tropes, and includes some geographically specific monster mythology. So considered holistically, this game does provide a rich story to play through  hence I played through it all in one night.  In terms of gameplay mechanics, though, most of the game is linear in the sense that the next place you go in the story is literally a straight shot from point A to point B. This is not an open world game (nor does it market itself as one, so I wasn't surprised). Despite the fact the game markets itself as empowering the player with autonomy, and the privilege of witnessing the outcome of your choices, the degree of freedom you enjoy is somewhat negligible. Basically, you go from one twist in the story to another without much room for exploration, and you choose between two options that, personally, just did not compel me either way. Ultimately Until Dawn plays like a choose-your-own-misadventure survival horror game, which is a fresh marketing concept, but the choices you can make are often pretty banal (will you go left or will you go right?). This leaves you desiring more freedom to explore the environment in some situations, and better options for choices in other situations.  One last consideration: as many reviews have already stated, this game is not a tactical combat or strategy game, and doesn't require skill. You just need to know that going into the game, or you'll have the wrong expectation for how the game engine operates. Personally, if I go into a game knowing that the extent of my skill level is simply pressing a button on the controller before time runs out, I'm totally cool with it. I haven't been sold on some misleading expectation. BUT, If you hate that aspect of games, you might want to sit this one out, because that essentially is the engine of this game. What makes this game fun is the narrative development, and if thats really not your cup of tea, and you really just want to get your gat and blast on fools this won't bring a crumb of those goods to the table.  In short, Until Dawn offers a fresh concept in survival horror games and is mostly well executed in terms of narrative development and aesthetics. You will probably wish the game play itself was more compelling in the choices it offers, and a little more open to exploration. But youll also probably want to stay up playing this until dawn.",Fresh concept for survival horror genre with rich aesthetics and narrative development,1448755200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",,visual player combat star privilege banal say tactical supply compel market scale room last get many thing acuity expectation gut totally outcome movie interaction fun mechanic write really despite extent table right survival point let explore state crumb meaningful almost would degree dawn choice controller forgive ultimately fresh either plus overall two narrative gameplay without stay go mythology tell every hook tropes wish surprise give know face succeed much character enjoy button gat like sell refer graphic seamlessly level development freedom character e.g might concept open execute horror market gun today element acoustic deep well long whats hope friend see consider one depth personally new term whole option determine leave predictable ruin first effect fright ten certain time hate consideration various cup felt game also argumentative snowball plain story rich choose precision monster moment play since story witness though take wish slide respect empower youll spot breaker holistically play yeah head work good genre trivial offer simply need think night next aspect environment marketing run know less draws leave aesthetic play strategy little silly exploration physic lot blast quality deal place hence wrong sense beautiful situation reveal game mostly sometimes truth provide cite sit make rating narrative i'm best often specific audio-visual knew well another get strong compelling care explicitly option butterfly find shot somewhat aesthetic way ample stun movie twist straight environment world moment press video mislead negligible refining tea linear autonomy disappointed already simple speaks feel compel fact play morning thats desire develop go engine dialogue probably cannot want cool fool sort geographically sympathetic literally operate even instinct basically forward skill microexpressions require bring short review disappoint around predicts choose-your-own-misadventure becomes include make outcomes people essentially available throw keep pretty

It has differences that I have never seen in any other RPG and it is pretty cool too.  First thing, you don't just follow the quest you are doing like they'll say to go to a certain place, you follow the path, run into a few battles, and your there.  No, in this game there are no paths.  There are different ways to go so you have to take a wild guess.  You are able to see the monsters so if you don't feel like fighting you can go around it instead of just a battle popping into your face.  Not only there is action in this game, there is some humor.  Theres always funny things happening here and there.  Also, this game is not like every other boring Mario game where you do the same thing, defeat Bowser and save Peach.  In this game some dude from Beanbean kingdom stole peach's voice and you have to get it back.  Bowser and his crew goes with you but they all get hurt so it is just you (mario) and luigi.

You can buy every weapon, go back to easier parts and see how each weapon ""fights"". You have light/heavy & short/long with different damage. You also have the option of using different spells. This is for those like me who want to prolong the game. I can't block/roll(.. physically disabled), so I go the ""best defense is a good offense"" strategy. You have many options how to win = you can thus make the game more difficult or easy based on your decisions. * Weapons - many choices. Light/Heavy; Short/Long; low damage/high damage; Augmentstions etc... You can try differnet weapons out per whatever part of the game; if you want to proplong the the adventure :-). Some weapons just plain look cool ! * Spells - well, I have my favorites, but tried them all. Some work much better than others vs certain enemies. You can pick and choose !. I believe you can beat the game with only 3, but I used my favorite 6 = to spice things up. * Story - well thought out. * Battles - many major fights * XP/Gem runs - I can think of 3 spots where you can increase these important categories. Nice when added to a game ! * Bugs - only a few desktop crashes; XP/SP2  All in all, you are not overwhelmed with too many options. Just get in there and fight :-)  Bad: * Voiceovers - sounded like 1-2 people did all the voices * Women/Villagers - basically the same model * Romance - well, one giggles and talk; the other actually seems to enjoy you. The third option for a wife is a special NPC and seems to be reading from a poor romance novel. Ok, you can hit the ESC button ?  If they wanted to go down this path, the designers should have put more variety/work into this option. Why no romance with Whisper ... would have fit the story + changed the same-ness Why no romamce with Briar Rose - as as above. Why no romance with a Bordello lady - same as above. Wouldn't fit with the story, but changed the same-ness. If you decide to give them a refuge, shouldn't the ladies talk to you; be open to romance ? They just stood there and posed. Why can't I buy clothes for my wives ... could buy a dress for myself  * Maps - I liked the trek from the Guild to Oakvale: much to do and fight. I would go back and forth several times. Hoped to run into Nymphs :-) Seems once you get to Knothole Glade, you really don't feel the need to go roaming and look for something to fight/do. Ok, you have the Arena; lots of fun here = unless you hero save, you do it once. Hook Coast - just part/path of the final showdown Snowspire - well, it's it if you do the last soul. What was the point of talking to villagers; getting married etc, you spent no time in these places. There could have been a cave or forrest or swamp; or a combination to give one something to do while in these villages.  Seems the final 1/3 of the game is just ""rushed upon you"" ... you feel like; "" might as well and just keep questing"" and get this over with. I would have liked to slow down, wander around; etc... If you didn't have the equipment/spells by now, you won't get them by coming to Hook Coast/Snowspire. All I can remember of value would be some xp or ""boosting potions"". If they were just quest driven locals, then only the map would be needed = I saw no reason to get a wife; buy anything at this point * Hero Save - ok if you want to do xp/key runs.

There is a bit of a let down as we don't get quite the closure with some of the characters near the end that would have been hoped for as becoming humanity's savior takes precedence.  You play as Adam Jensen, the head of security for an up and coming trans-human augment corporation. Unfortunately, Adam's life is turned upside down when an attack nearly kills him, leading to him to need life saving augmentations throughout his body. Jensen takes a sabbatical from work to adjust to his situation; however, events cause Jensen to need to return to work six months after the incident. The plot keeps you motivated and has a lot of twists and turns. Without any DLC and playing as a mix of ninja, hacker, and gunslinger, I clocked 35 hours from start to finish of a single play through. There are so many fun ways to approach any given section, you might be able to cloak and completely sneak by, move from object to object and knock out a few guards along the way, hack a gun turret or robots to obliterate the enemies in a room, punch through a wall and start blasting away with a minigun, set up some traps, or even completely avoid an area by jumping a fence or slipping into an airduct. There is no excuse to not enjoy the game because you can literally play it any way you want.  The only real weak point of the game is that boss fights can be a little bit rough on normal difficulty levels if you don't prepare for them with at least a few combat augmentations found on the Dermal Armor line (especially EMP shielding). The first boss was a bit tough for me, the second took a moderate amount of trial and error; however, by the third, I had enough augmentations across the board to take him down after only a couple of tries. The final boss was a complete push over for me as I could hack anything with an interface while laughing off most gunfire and EMP blasts, and had upgraded my revolver while stockpiling ammo for it to a point that would make Dirty Harry green with envy. Having mentioned stockpiling ammo, soldiers in the future seem to be able to pop off hundreds of rounds when they spot you while only ever carrying 2 or 3 rounds for you to take from their person; likewise, someone missed the memo that ammo usually comes 50 rounds to a box! You'll need to scrounge a lot of ammo and be proficient in several weapons to make it through the game if you are aren't planning a 100% sneaky approach (I carried both pistols, a tranquilizer rifle, a minigun, a stun gun, and an assault rifle for most of the game and used whichever had ammo on hand or best dealt with the situation).  Ultimately, not only will you enjoy this game, but it will make you think. I found myself asking a lot of questions about the ethics of transhumanism and what makes us indeed human. More developers need to be willing to explore and interweave issues like this into their storytelling. This game is money well spent; however, you may want to get the augmented edition for the extras like the soundtrack (the musical score by the way is superb, as is the acting and art direction).

2884,122405,5,False,"12 28, 2008",A16WKPOSEGQC3Y,B000X9FV5M,Nanohead,"First of all, I actually DID play through the game.  Till the end, did every mission.  Second, while I understand why folks here trashed it because of the SecuRom virus protection scheme, we should all take a deep breath and try to focus on the content of the game (yes, I know its hard)  Here is my 2 cents.  1)  The game is absolutely beautiful.  As photo realistic as COD4.  The artwork to me at least is a virtuoso performance from the artwork and production design team. 2)  The story line is really cool, but you have to have LOTS of patience to get to the end and see how it turns out (which is VERY neat and timely) 3)  There are something like 100 missions, of which 60% are completely repetitive and somewhat boring after a while.  You constantly have to travel to the OTHER side of the country just to some inane thing.  Why can't the bad buy be next door for once. 4)  The weapons...  well, lots of folks have already commented on how weird they are.  The choices are pretty weak indeed, but I guess they are appropriate for a third world banana republic revolution.  I can see why they had the weapons they had, but it still made it a bit annoying. 4a) The weapons.... having 4 weapon slots is fine, but let ME choose what I put in each slot, not the developer.  The game designers made a decision about what would be available in each slot, but unfortunately, their choices are pretty lousy and took away from the game.  Assault rifles and sniper rifles... you can have one or the other.  Dumb. 5)  The Save system is really really good, except, you have NO idea what the saves are.  With this flexible a save system, it would be useful to be able to Name saves or describe the somehow 6)  The characters and voice acting are totally excellent.  Very authentic and believable.  (a true improvement over FarCry, which was absurd) 7)  The transition from cutscene to gameplay is amazing.  The BEST I have ever seen.  It is totally natural and after a while, you forget its a game. 8)  Searching for diamonds and tapes...  now this one is really silly.  Yep, its standard video game fare to search for money and stuff, and not all of it is easy to get.  No problem.  But in this game, nearly HALF the diamonds are IMPOSSIBLE to get.  Can't be done.  It would seem like jumping is the way to do it (ala painkiller), but jumping up and rock faces does NOT work at all.  Stupid and stupid. 9)  Yep, as others have pointed out, the AI see you whether you creep around in the dark or not.  And sometimes they don't see you when they are standing in front of them.  This seems like well worn territory in shooters, and could have been better.  The code is there, but doesn't work right most of the time. 10) Guardpost discovery simply does not work half the time.  You can stand there, shoot everyone, pick up everything, and it still doesn't unlock.  Should have been caught in testing.  There are probably 100 other things to be said here.  This game IS AMAZING, but you need patience and time, not something all of us have.  The DRM controversy is coming to a head, and its too bad that great efforts like FC2 get trashed on boards like this because of DRM by folks who don't play the game.  I understand why that happens, but its not indicative of the games quality.  The developers and game studio should receive kudos here, while the publisher should be slapped in the face.","A very nice game, and I played it completely through...",1230422400,3.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,know second yep face code away weird hard realistic door breath performance rock work character head guardpost somewhat lousy country natural way repetitive trash assault like protection understand ever stand territory say decision ala board mission true shoot diamond travel absurd could simply turn half need republic actually fine receive try guess completely world useful search others jump timely next lot everyone least can't get virtuoso weapon folk video dumb dark unlock slap thing name developer slot seem take pick something weapon problem great already till third amaze totally indicative stupid tape money cutscene artwork deep well discovery unfortunately inane line put nearly see thing really silly one play point appropriate face securom cent annoy quality make slot right improvement beautiful let yes act revolution farcry able developer good publisher take sniper banana worn probably designer shooter first design boring team kudos bit neat stuff whether game effort cool studio transition time painkiller focus search test would patience sometimes standard creep everything buy bad game production choice still believable weak indeed somehow see voice easy front except virus mission save catch idea side authentic choose photo constantly around describe best forget story gameplay come system excellent content fare scheme seem comment end impossible happen controversy rifle well available do save flexible every absolutely ai pretty drm stand

The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.  Graphics - + Nice, environments were very detailed - Environments all looked the same.  Combat Innovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.  Game-play - This game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)  Re-Playability - None, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-power  Verdict - Possible rental, if it's cheap, or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging.

2894,425921,5,False,"05 24, 2016",A2AWMJMLLPBHDK,B017L187YG,B. Cravens,"Go get a large bowl out of the pantry. Add a few parts of the class structure of Team Fortress 1/2. Add a few more parts of MOBA-esque, team-based PvP. Then add first-person view. Lastly, stir in the remains of Blizzards mysterious yet failed MMO project, Titan, and you get Overwatch.  On the surface, Blizzards newest IP looks like a cash grab amidst the latest trend of making a first-person PvP-only game at the cost of $60, a la Titanfall, Evolve, etc. But Overwatch goes deeper. I implore you to hop on Google, search for Gamespots The Story of Overwatch series and specifically watch the part two video, Return of the 90s shooter. If you ever played Doom, Quake 2 or any of the mods that ultimately gave birth to arena-style shooters like Team Fortress Classic, you played in the same worlds that Overwatchs developers absolutely loved to play in back in the 90s, worlds full of mechanics and a different style of teamplay not found in today's popular military shooters. Watching Gamespot's video will reveal both how passionate Blizzard's Overwatch team is about their creation and what went into the game to set it apart from the plethora of FPS games on the market.  One of the ways Overwatch sets itself apart as a FPS is by having hero mechanics that are easy to learn yet satisfyingly hard to master. If you ever played Rocket League, you know how easy it is to pick up and play (even play well), but for super competitive players the skill ceiling goes very high. Same idea here. Its one thing to get the hang of flying around using D.vas Boosters, but its a whole other story when you learn how to pop her Self-Destruct ult while canceling a mid-air Boost, all at the right moment so the enemy team won't have enough time to escape the blast radius.  Another way OW is unique is how Blizzard took the team-orientation of PvP in a genre like MOBAs and translated it to FPS effectively. Team composition matters match-to-match, making wins feel extremely satisfying, regardless of whatever your K/D is (which isn't even a stat of importance due to Blizzard's 'elimination' model for kills). Doing this well is another attribute the dev team said was a priority in the Gamespot video series.  If you are completely new to Overwatch, please don't misunderstand -- this is a multiplayer-only game right now. Aside from various training modes, there is no campaign or single-player component. Two teams of six duke out matches against each other across 12 maps with three different objective-based modes that are randomly mixed each match. A player can play with 21 different heroes (with the ability to change heroes in the middle of a match). Each hero can be from one of four class types: offense, defense, tank or support. At the beginning of a game when your team is choosing heroes, a tip square on the right will let you know if your team, for instance, needs a support character or higher damage characters.  Speaking of heroes, no one is the same. Each hero has their own set of abilities (usually 2-3) and an ultimate. Though there is no single player, you can read up online about each character's backstory, and if you haven't watched any of the Overwatch animated shorts yet you are missing out.  As happy as I am with Overwatch right now, I must admit I have the same exact concerns I had/experienced with past online-only games of late. I fear Overwatchs content could get repetitive for many gamers, and having 2-3 modes doesnt help this (looking at you, Evolve). Having 21 heroes with specific roles and weapons that do not change could also be a source of burnout.  On the brighter side, Blizzard has promised that all non-cosmetic DLC  maps, heroes, etc.  will now and forever be FREE. Only cosmetic items will have a cost. This is a fantastic model that Rocket League similarly employs with much success, and I am hoping it will be as successful for Overwatch. To top it off, Blizzard has confirmed they already have been testing2 additional heroes.  Time will tell in the end. After the first month and definitely 3-4 months past a games release, a consistent player count emerges. Heres to hoping Blizzard will support Overwatch consistently as they do their other offerings. I will update my review after a few months.","Maybe the first $60, online-only game that gets it right",1464048000,81.0,"{'Edition:': ' Origins', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",,player go cosmetic offering repetitive team ever fear overwatchs say project player market composition search emerge animate amidst self-destruct blizzard's get objective-based many thing dlc make different league doesnt burnout ability happy role read pvp mechanic mode enemy ip part tell quake success ability right cash dev exact let shooter higher across la backstory confirm boost stir late release brighter idea ultimately implore set two d.vas campaign ow character's return go ultimate mid-air review know count mixed had/experienced hard admit much view character type hero like fly way duke could four character usually matter cost watch apart fortress due definitely instance online-only unique offense one moba-esque new priority whatever choose whole forever plethora translate pvp-only k/d similarly first item help time radius various overwatch top damage concern team-orientation employ etc game also match rocket ceiling grab side need moment style yet story classic though bowl single-player short use booster three competitive mobas tank support give arena-style non-cosmetic play additional titanfall satisfy component teamplay genre world extremely creation hero regardless successful attribute stat map team-based enough change gamespot tip structure cancel must randomly go middle here find set win series blast back aside train free single take misunderstand online consistently reveal team game google watch evolve part gamespot's importance blizzard escape hop match-to-match watch mod begin specific gamespots well fps another effectively look defense look master month multiplayer-only pop deeply mysterious match remain way love model surface add completely ult passionate six specifically trend consistent video high pick weapon please already first-person feel doom source hang lastly birth hop square play miss gamers popular developer pantry large super update blizzard full learn month kill fail military fantastic speaking promise even titan today's easy shooter satisfyingly skill class around elimination mmo content end past late newest absolutely

Ng,"If you're a fan of the Three Kingdoms genre and played ROTK and Dynasty Warrios, and you love strategy and aciton, then this game is for you.  First of all, I didn't like Dynasty Warrios 4. I felt that the enemy AI is dumb.  They just stand around and wait for you to come near them. For me, the best is DW3. This doesn't mean that DW4: Empires is better.  The AI still stands still, and only the enemy generals run around the battlefield.  What's worse is that you don't have bodyguards anymore.  For me the redeeming factor is the strategy aspect.  Instead of a linear musou mode, your objective is to conquer all the provinces of china.  You chose when to raise troops, build weapons, attack, defend, bribe, hire generals, etc.  No more picking up special items because these are crafted by your citizens.  Centain provinces have certain products and you can trade them with other items from other Kingdoms.  You can also use them as gifts to win the hearts of enemy generals.  If you lose a battle, it's ok (this is what a lot of games lack).  Attacking and defending provinces brings you to the Dynasty Warrios action mode.  Yet the action mode has strategy elements.  The map is dotted with strongholds (spawn points) that you capture. Similar to Battlefield 1942.  Your main objective is to capture the HQ (you can also win by defeating the ruler if present in the battlefield).  To do that you must creep your way through capturing strongholds one by one.  You can bypass some but remember that enemy troops can spawn there and cut your ""line of supply"".  Strongholds are also useful on your end since they spawn food and soldiers.  When I'm having problems in the front, it doesn't hurt to retreat to a nearby stonghold.  Enemy generals respawn at the HQ.  Some people find this annoying.  But since only generals can capture strongholds and the normal soldiers stand still most of the time, I believe this is an acceptable compromise to make the game more challenging.  If you form an alliance, your ally will send one of his generals to help you out in the battle.  Downside: the objective of all the action sequences are the same unlike musou mode in the other DW series.  Some people will find this monotonous.  Yet the game is still lacking for my standards.  I'm still longing for the day that you can command your generals and tell them where to go ala Kessen.  So if you like simple strategy games with a hint of action, I'd recommend this game.  If you loved the DW series and all it's aspects, this may not be the right game for you. You could probably try Samurai Warriors (which I also like a lot because of it's branching missions). As a warning: this game is very different from the other DW games.",Good blend of strategy and action,1095811200,5.0,,,bribe product send dot kingdom play centain use attack find hurt genre troop raise way branch capture respawn sequence bypass like stand love ally warrior kessen ala recommend stonghold factor province supply could near come hq try useful dw objective action china normal problem aspect dumb mode point bad dynasty i'd wait aciton linear general craft weapon warrios elements simple different rotk spawn downside must better defend stronghold defend soldier unlike ok line long strategy food brings anymore one enemy command love series lot annoy challenge tell hire empire right hint battlefield attack cut similar believe redeem nearby win probably warn ruler first lack item game certain remember monotonous help time what's present creep etc game fan felt also still standard battle form trade front alliance day pick defeat chose aspect mission musou make samurai main lacking build special capture i'm bodyguard around since best map yet mean instead run heart end people gift conquer acceptable go three may citizens lose ai retreat compromise stand

2914,403131,5,True,"01 18, 2016",A124EOGC223CY4,B00YQ2KCWO,Average American Reviewer,"Holy crap....addicting game. This review is not for the long time fans, but more for the first timers like myself just wondering if it is worth getting or not. Or if they should just wait until the price drops (I usual wait 1-2 years after a game comes out before getting it.  Hint: Get it now. Screw waiting. It is one of the few games you don't want to wait.  My first Fallout game. Bought it on a recommendation from a friend. I was expecting a straight FPS- which I am not a fan of or some MMO- online only. Thankfully, it was none of these. It is an open world, single player, thinker game. Yes, there is some FPS aspects, but it is not a run-n-gun. Still learning the crafting aspects. They are interesting. Good skill progression. You will revisit areas time and time again. Example: clear it the place out for a mission. Go back for looting of needed resources. Go back again once your skill for pick/hacking a lock is high enough. There is a lot of replay ability in it so far.  Lot of good backstory I am learning. Games like this make me go back and play the previous versions.  There are a lot of references in the game to Americana.  Resources: What you would initially think of as junk. Items like duct tape and table fans are very valuable...for their component parts. Adhesives and screws...never find enough. At least in the beginning.  Settlements: Finding a new settlement. Set up, build, learn the spawn points to concentrate your defenses. Drop in some traders (trade, bars, and clinic) to make caps.  Back to the open world, I played World of Warcraft for years. Loved how you could literally just get lost wandering around seeing all the attention to detail the programmers put into the game. Fallout: its there. They did a lot of work.  One of the few top game I really love enough to say it was worth buying and not waiting.  Update: Now that a bunch of the DLC content has dropped an update is due. Still addicting. Still addicted- no not going to seek treatment.  Keep in mind, I am a slow player. Level 100+ at this writing. I still have not sided with or against the institute. Nor have I even traveled to Far Harbor. Every time I think I have mined out the bulk of the main game...surprise. New missions I missed (yes, at level 101) earlier in the game.  Mechanist- great addon. Lets you tinker and build your own robots. Get the hacking skill. It will save you a lot of hassle. Hack-shut down. Now in the middle of fire fight you do not have to fight a big nasty robot (who also gives two fusion cores). Lots of repeating missions (hunt down robots)  Fight Pits- decent. But I like the fact I can capture brahim (cows) now for my settlements.  Raider DLC- In the middle of this one. Enjoying it. Gage is decent companion who only ""dislikes"" your actions when you take mentats (I usually do for a critical charisma check or maxing a sale with a merchant). Otherwise, kill, pick locks, whatever, he is good. Too bad I will need to kill him later when I burn the raiders to the ground.

I just started and got creamed in the first level.  The learning curve of such of game was too intense.  Car combat is so simple, why should it take a while to get used to it?  Anyway, with no advancement and no visual aesthetics, I quickly dismissed this game. Fortunately, I came back to it.  I grew accustomed to the drab, gray graphics, I figured out some strategy, and I switched the difficulty to easy.  What happened amazed me.  This game which I thought was terrible turned out to be pretty good. You get to choose between around 12 different characters.  Each character pretty much goes through the same levels, so once you've been through a few characters, you've seen all the levels in the game.  Each character controls another car, and more importantly, gives you a cool movie describing his or her ordeal. These movies are what make the game.  Though very, very short (nothing close to Final Fantasy X), these little 30-second clips are disturbing, intense, dark, and simply amazing.  The credits, with a montage of the various cut scenes played to Rolling Stone's ""Fade to Black"" is worth the price of this relatively inexpensive game alone.

To begin, the controller attaches to the Wii remote, so it is in fact wireless.  So you don't have to deal too much with cords in the way.  Although, this brings about the problem of your Wii remote batteries dying.  Then your shell controller doesn't work so well either.  Another interesting aspect of the classic controller is that you can use it to navigate through the Wii channels if you like.  The layout of the controller is almost an exact replica of the classic Super Nintendo Controller.  The differences are two Z buttons, one next to the L button and one next to the R button, and a home button to navigate back to the wii menu.  Its fantastic for playing virtual console games because the buttons are set to correspond to the same things they did on their respective controllers.  Although at the same time this can be troublesome, particularly for playing Nintendo 64 games.  If you plan on downloading N64 games, the Gamecube Controller works far better than the shell controller does.  Mainly because the button layout just feels awkward at times.  The Z buttons are small, unlike the Gamecube controller which happens to have a fairly large one.  The control stick is also far better on the Gamecube Controller for N64 games and the A and B button placements are better as well.  Otherwise, if you plan on getting a Super Nintendo game, this controller is perfect!  It's also perfect for NES games, although you could just use the wii remote to play those games (although, the wii remote definitely feels awkward at first).  Aside from that, the classic controller works extremely well.  There are a couple of problems, however.  For starters, the classic controller doesn't work for Gamecube games at all.  This brings about the question as to whether the classic controller is worth buying at all.  The answer is simply that it depends on what you want more of.  If you plan on playing tons of Super Nintendo games on your virtual console, then yes the classic controller is a fantastic buy.  It even works better than the Wii remote when playing classic NES games and TurboGrafx-16 games.  However, you can't help but admit the Gamecube controller works great as well (although the Gamecube controller doesn't work quite as well with Super Nintendo games; just try playing Contra III).  The classic controller is great, but until there's actually a Wii game that requires it above all else, its hard to tell people with Gamecube controllers that they'll absolutely need it.  It's a great controller, but not yet a necessity.  On the positive side  +The button layout is pretty good +Can be used to navigate the Wii Menu +Attaches to the Wii remote so you don't have to deal with a lot of cords +Controls are precise and corespond accordingly to each game +Works especially well with Super Nintendo games  On the negative side  -It feels awkward with N64 games (the Gamecube controller is better) -As of yet, there are no wii games that require the classic controller -It's really difficult to recommend the classic controller when the Gamecube controller works just fine as well.  Perhaps when a game for the Wii that requires the controller it'll be a lot easier to recommend to people.  So it really IS a good controller, but unless you plan on playing tons of Super Nintendo classics, the Gamecube controller is a better buy right now--especially if you plan on playing Nintendo 64 games.",A Very Good Controller in Most Cases,1164499200,403.0,,,gamecube hard menu awkward negative admit much downloading channel use nintendo quite remote work investment button wii way extremely like positive however recommend contra require download could depend simply need fine actually perfect virtual try question attache time next problem can't aspect controller iii correspond button ne ton big problem buying definitely great feel console begin navigate layout good although interesting unlike fairly starter thing really bring one fact replica play lot tell back control aside deal answer right point exact far yes go easier home good possibility large use worth corespond couple otherwise first super whether game want respective cord almost they'll cause time help perhaps get difference especially placement fantastic particularly wireless buy bad also game work even accordingly shell plan controller mainly else classic it'll difficult side case either necessity require play stick set two classic yet now--especially instead battery happen unless there's people precise well troublesome get another may die absolutely small pretty control

2941,297981,3,False,"09 12, 2013",A1ETMNKF9HO2TJ,B00C1ZBFTW,ahw,"Shin Megami Tensei IV is an unorthodox and challenging game that will click for some and will be inscrutable to others.  For starters, the story and setting will likely be bizarre for Western audiences unfamiliar with Japanese culture, particularly anime culture.  The setting does not fit into any ""traditional"" Western genre such as science fiction, fantasy, etc.  The story involves samurai, who do not look like samurai and instead wear what looks like school uniforms.  The samurai fight with swords and older, feudal weapons, yet also have access to computerized gauntlets, guns and other modern amenities.  They both fight and ally with demons.  It all makes for a very weird experience.  On top of the odd story and setting, the presentation is very minimalist, which can be disappointing to some.  Initially, world navigation is done via menu, with the player selecting where to go from a menu of locations.  When you get to your first dungeon, you navigate by controlling a sprite.  Disappointingly, enemy demons in dungeons are represented by amorphous sprites of blue digital static instead of 3D models resembling what the demons actually look like.  When your character sprite bumps into one of the blue blobs of digital static, a battle is initiated, but you really can't tell what you are going to fight until after the battle starts.  Later in the game, the presentation gets even lazier, as world map navigation is done by moving a green arrow around a map.  In other words, unlike other RPGs where you move around the world map with a sprite that looks like your character, the developers replaced the sprite with a simple green arrow.  On the world map, encounters are again initiated when your green arrow bumps into a circle of blue digital static.  IMO, this lack of attention to presentation is lazy and makes the game less engrossing.  The gameplay is a cross between Pokemon and old-school RPG's like the Dragon Quest series.  Battles take place between your party (your player-character, up to three of your demons, and an ally) and the enemy.  The battle screens are very similar to Dragon Quest, in that all you see is a 2D anime-style sprite drawing of your enemies on a generic background.  Your party takes turns doling out attacks and can earn extra moves by getting critical hits or using an attack that the enemy is vulnerable to.  Your party can also lose turns by missing with their attack or using an attack that the enemy is immune to.  The enemy is also subject to these same rules.  This relative simple rule-set results in a battle system that you'll either find challenging and enjoyable, or arbitrary and frustration.  It is challenging in that it offers the opportunity to strategize the makeup of your team and their moves to exploit the weakness of your enemy.  It can be frustrating in that you are often vulnerable to being combo'd to death by enemies using attacks that your party is weak to, giving the enemy party multiple turns to wipe out your party.  As a result, a boss battle will typically involve this sequence of gameplay: an initial encounter with a new boss to ""feel out"" his strengths and weaknesses.  If it's an easy boss, or you're just lucky and happen to have a party that is built the right way, maybe you can kill the boss on your first try.  More often though, you'll die on your first try, but hopefully get some intel on what element the boss is weak to and what element its attacks are.  Then, you grind your way to building a party that can exploit the bosses weaknesses and resist the bosses attacks.  Building your party is a lot like Pokemon.  Most ""regular"" enemy demons you encounter can be recruited via the ""Talk"" command.  Negotiating with demons is another aspect of SMT4's gameplay that might frustrate some players because a lot of demons will troll you hard.  Many demons will ask for money, items, or even free attacks against the player.  A lot of times, they will ask arbitrary questions with arbitrary ""correct"" answers.  A lot of times, acquiescing to a demon's demands will result in the demon laughing at your and running away after collecting your gifts.  Recruitment often requires multiple attempts to ""learn"" the demon's personality and be able to predict what answers will satisfy them.  Personally, I found demon recruiting to be rather amusing, because it's akin to trying to make friends with anonymous users on an Internet message board.  Sometimes it's straightforward, other times you have to figure out how to make friends with a troll.  However, I can see how this aspect of the game can be a turn-off for others.  New demons can also be created by ""fusing"" two or more demons already in your party.  You are allowed to see the results of any fusion before you commit to it, and review the new demon's stats and moves to see if it's an upgrade.  The game has a seemingly infinite number of demon types.  The design of each demon is very creative, in a Lovecraft-ian type way.  However, one of the aspects of the game that I found somewhat frustrating is the fact that the demon types are so bizarre it's hard to keep track of each demon's strength and weaknesses.  Sometimes the demons will have a name and appearance that relates to their type (like the Jack Frost demon, who looks like a snowman and is predictably strong against ice attacks and weak against fire attacks).  Most of the time, demons will have bizarre names and appearances, so who knows what they do.  The same could be said for the names of the moves in the game Healing spells are called 'Dia' or 'Media,' while 'Agi' is a fire attack, and 'Tarukaja' is a buff that increases your party's attack power.  Thankfully, you are told what each move does when you hover over them, minimizing the inconvenience.  Still, I sometimes wish the moves were given more obvious names so it is quicker to scan a movelist and know what each move does.  In sum, SMT4 is a very niche game that will appeal to gamers who appreciate the challenge and are looking for something different from the familiar tropes used in most video games.  Buy the game if you don't mind dying a lot, and don't mind a substantial amount of grinding and exploration.  However, if you are a casual gamer or someone who is turned off by the oddball setting or minimalist presentation, SMT4 will not be for you.",Unorthodox and Challenging Game That May Not Be For Everyone,1378944000,7.0,,,player grind japanese internet power jack maybe rpg's sum megami say start player select wipe figure traditional actually location try akin presentation culture makeup time turn lovecraft-ian get player-character upgrade many build oddball different later vulnerable demon movelist scan really enemy command model tell appeal right imo attack odd recruitment frustrate try type amorphous question gauntlet kill school sequence particularly familiar casual sprite predictably negotiate quest click samurai experience either fantasy build run two gameplay system call board fight initiate go told do lose bump relative dia trope wish snowman review replace know away hard move feudal involve name amount personality type stats like element extra weakness resist could turn character might spell user swords can't enjoyable relates modern demon name dungeon money fiction appearance friends obvious one personally death new anime-style generic engrossing increase commit demand likely shin bizarre uniform anonymous attempt access first item time top give message buy etc game also talk still attention weak see typically ice buff create appreciate initially resemble die map yet story correct though battle take ask use three heal give rather old-school weird earn menu appearance navigation recruit control disappointingly genre strategize fire ally offer however boss frustrate opportunity others straightforward aspect circle frost take initial weakness less found dragon attack exploration series lot challenge place regular similar enemy able free gamer satisfy setting allow used fit design team doling game demon's arrow draw result intel mind western collect background sometimes boss strength encounter static troll amenity niche make move turn-off seemingly word combo'd move often represent critical look lazy predict happen gift unorthodox inscrutable another get amuse strong laugh look die minimize looks track via hover minimalist hit find somewhat way screen result quicker science fusion require substantial someone exploit rpgs world audience rule lucky wear video sprite weapon something multiple creative lazy already simple pokemon feel navigate iv anime starter unlike answer fuse involves tensei fact frustration infinite miss cross green medium unfamiliar strength subject gamers blob developer go inconvenience gun lack digital number tarukaja learn hopefully blue recruit challenge party's even battle grind easy acquiesce rule-set aspect computerize encounter disappoint around know instead make party agi dungeon get arbitrary thankfully immune old keep

2950,8850,4,False,"01 13, 2006",A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00002ST8W,SRFireside,"Of all the Genesis games I played back in the old days this was my favorite. Not just because I was familar with the source material of the same name (Shadowrun is a table top role playing game), but the way they incorperated the material into a pretty impressive console game.  The Shadowrun setting is essentially a mix between Blade Runner and Lord of the Rings. You have major corporations controlling a dystopic metropolis (Seattle) while at the same time elves, ghouls, trolls, dragons and other fantasy creatures are seen in everyday life. With you get magic spells along with guns and cybernetic implants. In this game you are an operative for hire. A shadowrunner. This entails you getting assignments ranging from being a bodyguard, courier, corporate thief and more. Along the way you also have a personal mission to take care of. The way this all is put together makes for some great gameplay.  First off Shadowrun is completely open ended. You pick what kind of runner you want to be (cybered up mercenary called a street samurai, mage for fire, or futuristic computer hacker) and you decide what jobs you will do. You're not even that limited by the character you pick. You can give your mage some cybernetic implants or build up your samurai's computer skills. I think you can even get both to start casting spells. The trick is as you gain experience in the game you only have so much resources to use in increasing your skills so technically it's best to pick one and roll with it. Personally I recommend being a Decker (futuristic hacker) as it gives you more levels of gameplay.  Not only is character generation open ended, but the game world is as well. You can travel all over Seattle and the outskirts without being stuck in some linear path. It's funny how people go nuts about Grand Theft Auto and how you can go anywhere and do anything. Well this was doing that long before. As you explore the world around you meet various different characters. Some will just talk to you or sell you stuff. Others will hire you for shadowruns. There are also other shadowrunners out there for you to meet and even hire to help you with your missions.  The gameplay is pretty straight forward. When not in combat you walk around and talk to people, collect items. Pretty standard fare. When in combat things are a bit different. It essentially becomes a move around and shoot as much as you can sort of deal. It's all done with auto aiming so this part really isn't like scrolling shooter. Also be warned you can miss your target... a lot. But as long as you continue to increase your shooting skills in the RPG aspects it works out. A high enough skill level and you won't ever miss.  Another form of gameplay you get to do as a decker is jacking into the matrix. What that basically means is a virtual reality type Internet. The world looks like something from Tron and you go around with a silver persona of yourself zapping or sneaking past intrusion countermeasures as you steal data from computer systems. Gameplay is about the same as other combat modes in that you press a lot of buttons with the exception of a little more tactical planning in picking your programs to fight with.  Okay enough about game mechanics. Essentially the gameplay can get repetitive what with the combat mode and walking about, but that's what's to expect from an RPG. What makes the game jibe so well is the story behind it. All that non-linear gameplay sets up the feeling of being in a living, breathing environment. At least as good as you can get from the Sega Genesis (keep in mind boys and girls this is the 16 bit era). The personal mission you have is more linear, but since you can get on and off track of that anytime you feel it still feels more fluid. The climax of the game feels big and gets you pumped. Definitely worth the effort for 16 bit console fans.  The Sega Genesis is known for being better at music and sound than the Super Nintendo. However the SNES version of Shadowrun (totally different kind of game by the way) I feel actually had better music. Sounds effects, on the other hand, are better on this one. If you want an overal game comparison ultimately the story and gameplay on the Genesis version beat out the SNES (however the songs are cooler on the SNES version).  I loved playing this game and it's the only reason I still have my Genesis. If you are a fan of RPG games from this era, or a Shadowrun, or a fan of cyberpunk styled games I highly this one to you.",Very fun RPG from the Genesis era.,1137110400,4.0,,,internet incorperated steal combat stick implant repetitive ever ring tactical street actually dragon walk get silver favorite expect press ghouls different totally blade path non-linear mage mechanic really mode part beat cooler table hire funny outskirt nut kind limit explore type jack genesis end target bit stuff version highly miss trick work futuristic pick metropolis sound ultimately samurai experience fantasy hacker anywhere collect gameplay without call fight go job do feel give countermeasure move much aim effort nintendo character intrusion like creature shoot level program character open spell name button generation effect definitely sell console good long runner see mercenary corporation one personally role increase girl impressive material shadowrun give worth day shadowruns first item help time live various bodyguard top auto game also snes talk still meet troll mission build play since sega range story old jibe behind comparison data climax elves personal tron planning zap play magic hand use control gain matrix fire recommend mission however travel song know virtual think others cybered reality cybernetic least environment fluid enough system take big everyday familar mean fan music operative little thing set theft lot back technically deal samurai's good set boy anytime shadowrunner major game mind entails thief what's standard level start pump form cyberpunk breathing continue best along shadowrunners life fare well another get care look track warned corporate way love straight overal world completely shoot high mode linear pick roll something great feel feel decker source assignment put dystopic that's persona computer walk courier reason exception sound together gun super want skill sort resource fan even increase basically mix cast shooter aspect sneak forward skill rpg seattle scroll grand around becomes okay make people essentially lord decide past get anything keep style era pretty
2951,244595,5,True,"05 15, 2013",A1HX5GS72Y3BXQ,B0050SYY5E,Jesse Booth,"I have been a Halo fan since November 2001, when Halo CE was released.  At first, I played only multiplayer, but then I discovered the depth of the story involved with the campaign and was instantly hooked. Since then, I've bought and read every Halo novel and bought and played every Halo game. The story is phenomenal, one of the best in science fiction.  And with that little preface, here is my review.  First off, this remake was made for fans of the campaign. The multiplayer is connected to Halo Reach, so even though they remade my favorite all-time Halo CE map (Hang 'em High), it just isn't the same without the Halo CE mechanics.  The campaign is more than just a remake in HD.  It feels just like the original game, because it is the original game with a new aesthetic layer that pretties it all up.  So it is exactly the same, just a lot easier on the eyes.  They implemented additional story pieces called terminals. There is one in each level, and they give you a better understanding of 343 Guilty Spark, as well as the Flood.  We also get to hunt for skulls! Yay! These skulls make the game so much fun, enhancing your abilities, or screwing you up.  Luckily, I preordered and got the Grunt Funeral Skull, which makes each grunt you kill turn into a plasma grenade. Add the skull that increases grenade damage radius and you get some crazy explosions all over the place!  At any given time, you can jump back to the original graphics from Halo CE. I had to use this feature a couple of times in different areas, but I kept it HD for the most part.  I have yet to try out co-op over XBOX live, but hear that it is quite laggy. Not a big issue for me... I prefer to play through Legendary solo.  Another feature actually allowed me to utilize my Kinect! The library allows you to scan just about everything during your campaign playthrough and creates a sweet database with a description of the things you've scanned. It's fun to go through each slide and read about each item/enemy/etc.  The audio got a complete rebuff. It sounds so good! And the newly orchestrated soundtrack is amazing. I bought that, as well, but I won't review that here.  Basically, this game is worth your time and money if you loved the campaign on Halo CE.

2960,266374,5,True,"10 10, 2012",A3RUQO10JKY9NT,B006WQR3GA,Cameron,"++++++ BACKGROUND ++++++ X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a remake of the classic game X-Com: UFO Defense (UFO: Enemy Unknown outside North America) released in 1994 and is considered one of the top ten games of all time for the computer.  There are currently two re-makes currently undergoing development to be published by 2K. The first, known as XCOM, will be produced by Irrational games and depicts the XCOM universe as a First Person Shooter in the 1950's although recent announcements suggest it has been moved to the 1960's and will be squad based combat.  The second, X-Com: Enemy Unknown, was developed by Firaxis games and consists of the game I am currently reviewing. Firaxis are veteran developers of the genre of strategy games due to development of games such as Alpha Centauri and Civilization under the guidance of Sid Meier, one of the companies co-founders and creators of such classic games as Sid Meier's PIRATES!, Civilization, and Railroad Tycoon.  ++++++ GAMEPLAY & COMBAT ++++++ X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a return to the world of single player strategy games that are few and far in-between in this world of first person multi-player shooters. Gameplay is divided in-between two areas; management and battle skirmishes.  In management, you build up your bases, upgrade facilities, preform research and development of weapons all the while monitoring your finances which always feel like a heavy burden you are carrying upon your shoulder you just cannot escape.  The skirmishes are where the meat and bones of the game lie and where you may spend a majority of your time. Simple choices you make in a turn-based fashion have an overall effect on the outcome of the battle. If you slip and make a poor choice the computer will make you feel that error. It may seem fun to go around and annihilating everything in your pass by using high explosive weapons but strategy requires you to capture and collect your enemies bodies and weapons. To get close requires strategy, planning, and luck several moves out. A well thought out strategy and turn is the key to success.  You spend your time recruiting, customizing, and developing your soldiers while watching them rise through the ranks after each successful mission becoming attached in the process only to have them fall in combat....and fall they shall. Your memorial wall will be filled by the midpoint of the game from the losses you will sustain. With the close intimacy of you and your men, the loss of a high ranking officer is a devastating moment to be played through and experience first hand.  The gameplay, compared to the original, has been streamlined but that is expected as the fact the game has been customized to fit the multiple of consoles it has been released for as well as the fact the field of gaming has changed a tremendous amount in the eighteen years since the original was released. The console does play rather well compared to its keyboard/mouse counterpart on the PC.  ++++++ GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION ++++++ The graphics are, obviously, an improvement over its 1994 counterpart. I have had several issues with camera angels. Also, the action shots that you endure that became popular since Fallout 3 are entertaining if somewhat repetative. The skirmishes provide a very destructive environment that will leave the battlefield resembling swiss cheese that was burnt in a microwave.  ++++++ CHALLENGE ++++++ The game is challenging but is not at the point where you feel as if you need to throw the controller at the wall because you have reached an in pass in gameplay.  Some have stated that this game is more difficult than the original. The reason why is the original X-Com in 1994 contained an error so all difficulty levels were the same. Later X-Com games were noted for their increased difficulty because this issue was fixed in sequels and later editions of the game.  ++++++ STORY ++++++ The story is, overall, engrossing throughout the game and provides motivation to make it to the finish to see the end result. Who doesn't enjoy a good Human VS the Evil Aliens story?  ++++++ CONCLUSION ++++++ This game is worthwhile of the title ""X-Com"" even with the high expectations and standards set before it by the classic ""X-Com"" of 1994. This game has met and exceeded the challenges set before it.  Highly recommended for those that enjoy turned based strategy games as well as those that desire something different than the dozens of first person shooter games that now littler the video game marketplace.",A re-make that does justice for the classic it follows,1349827200,7.0,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",,player intimacy combat devastate counterpart console civilization presentation turn pirate get upgrade review different later rank outcome tremendous provide rise soldier fun centauri enemy turn success original point far recent increase stated shooter highly carry difficulty dozen publish everything choice annihilate become leave controller difficult monitoring release experience process overall midpoint two set collect gameplay entertain undergoing return depicts go may turn-based develop camera desire fix preform person amount think destructive enjoy railroad like graphic divide development evil america title several due reach console remake x-com repetative loss marketplace loss finish consider ufo suggest slip upon one conclusion wall meat unknown battlefield engross alien first effect ten vs time co-founders game spend top issue game also area see customize burden fashion year human universe choice build moment body pass since resemble classic story exceed heavy fill worthwhile use always plan expectation rather second explosive note swiss recruiting play hand genre creator become alpha streamline mission finance cheese know need successful firaxis environment luck poor pc consist endure bone veteran obviously in-between although rank officer strategy meet challenge improvement shall tycoon enemy good single memorial fit irrational game result produce motivation background level close standard provide sid squad escape challenge majority make move develop watch field capture xcom eighteen attach management throughout shoulder well research expect defense keyboard/mouse combat....and fall fallout somewhat move men require sequels world meier action skirmish guidance video high company recommend weapon something multiple simple feel burnt sustain shot lie fact play base angel littler change re-makes issue currently computer popular compare reason developer outside cannot announcement edition key challenge multi-player customize even battle error shooter north meier's microwave around contain seem end facility base throw

My main complaint with this  game has nothing to do with the game or developers except that they should  be more careful about who they allow to start fan sites. A certain very  popular site, perhaps the best site with the best forum gave me a very bad  experience. In one of my first posts a regular there refered to me as  stupid and silly and wondered in public if I was senile. All this because I  questioned the diplomatic system in AOK, which any competent reviewer will  recognize as being a joke.  When I complained to the moderators of this  site about this abusive behavior and a general abusive behavior towards  Americans, I was banned from the forum and my ISP contacted for the crime  of contacting these people through e mail.  And now on to more pertinent  information. I found the game easy to learn and fun to play. The  graphics were good but not great. Pretty soon I found myself relying on one  strategy. Wall out the invaders. Get to castle age as quick as I can and  build lots of town centers to expand and defend. Once you beat the initial  big invasion, the idiotic AI tends to just send invaders in little trickles  that never stop, but aren't that hard to deal with. It's fun to use  the various seige weapons, but I didn't really bother mastering the armor  and tremendous variety of knights and swordsmen. They all looked about the  same to me with the exception of the english longbowmen. You could play  this game for a very long time, but there are lots of very good games to  play. This is deep strategy, but not as deep as Railroad  Tycoon 2 and  Rogue Spear. It's also all tiny people and buildings. There's no zooming in  and out or rotating. The fans are kind of ummmm...well, you read what I  said above. I only played twice on the internet and the first guy  left as soon as I knocked down his whole wall with a massive seige attack.  The game then ended leaving me without the ability to even finish off what  he'd built.

These will include the comfort, performance, and materials used in manufacturing and how they have lasted after extended use (I have used my SS Rival for about 10 months). Let's get into it shall we...  First, let's talk about the performance of this mouse. Outstanding, to put it into a one word answer. This mouse, even after months of use, is still performing top-notch as it did out of the box when it first arrived on my doorstep. The tracking is something to smile over, and the responsiveness and precision is spot on with what you would expect in a gaming mouse. No problems or complaints whatsoever on this aspect of the mouse.  Now the materials. The material used on the mouse is also nice, but can leave behind some sweat stains after extended use. The rubber grip on the side, particularly where my thumb sits (and sweats) has been reduced to a smooth worn down remnant of what it once, and now gets ""gummy"" and liquified after long play sessions. However, to fix this issue, I just put a piece of black electrical tape over it, and boom, problem solved.  Doesn't look pretty, but hey, I can't complain. The ghetto-rigged electrical tape and sweat stains are a sign of the bondage we've amassed through our times together, like a grizzled warrior and his trusty sword.  The mouse is very comfortable. I have large hands, and I use a claw-ish fingertip grip. Palm grip users should be comfortable using this mouse too, and as for fingertip grip, if your hands are larger than 7 inches in length, go for it. There may be a grace period of getting used to it, like when you buy a new car, it takes a little bit to accustom yourself to the feel of it. This mouse has daily driver comfort all over it.  A few more things before I wrap up, the SteelSeries switches used for the LMB and RMB are awesome. They are not easily pressed, and require some force to actuate, but are not too hard to press, and I love them. The side button placement could be better, to say the least, depending on your grip and hand size of course. Needless to say they do feel good to press, and actuation is quick and responsive.  All in all, 5 stars. Yes, the materials start to wear down after some use, but my rating is all about performance. Not only has this mouse performed excellent with tracking and precision on day one, but after months and months and months of use, there have been no issues hindering its performance, and no parts have fallen off.

2990,89267,5,False,"03 20, 2007",AJS8E8GAEJY6M,B000GKCI4A,Indiana Gamer,"One of the biggest games around has come to the playstation 3 and about time it did and its called Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion .   First off what sets this version differently from the xbox 360 is that it comes with the bonus content like that was released for the pc then later came out on a xbox magazine cd so you could install.   The graphics will honestly blow you away , and bring the player more into the game . The detail you will see is just so freaking cool . The graphics seen in the playstation 3 version really do stand out . They also look decent on most regular tv's and of course if your hooked up to a hdtv it will look alot better.   The audio for everything in this game is really well done . I have my ps3 hooked up to a sony theater system and sounds really well and brings the game more to life . I have also tested on a normal setup no theater and sounds really well for tv speakers .   The controls might take a little time to learn for most player's but some might be able to pickup a little faster .   The fun factor can come in many different way's but will touch base on two of the biggest that most might like is that being able to design your own toon , and the replay value .    Being able to design your own toon is a good key feature to any game ! The reason is the player gets to see his or hers creation level up and become alot more powerful in whatever class path they select.   The replay value to this game is endless and falls back to alot in being able to design your own toon. The game will be alot different if you did it once as a fighter type then later as a caster type . Just seeing you hack and slash to a monster , might be better for some players . Also being a caster blasting a creature with magic , might be funner for a different bunch of players .   So honestly Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for the playstation 3 falls under one of the must have titles list. This game packs it all into a blue ray disk , great graphics, audio, extremly good replay value as well a great gaming time for the player . Also already having the bonus content already in the game , just really adds more insane fun for the player to check out.   The bonus content i talk about is the Knights of the Nine expansion . It was released for the pc version , then also came out for the xbox 360 with that one you had to get it via download or off a cd.   One last thought the playstation 3 might have started out with a minor selection of games . The list is starting to grow now with alot more better games comming out. If you was looking for a reason to get a playstation 3 , look at some of the titles comming out and oblivion is verry good choice for showing off the power of the playstation 3.   Have a great playing time with a great title for the playstation 3 called Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion !",A true must have title for the playstation 3.,1174348800,15.0,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},,player fall via away scroll power base magic detail title think speaker knight feature xbox like come way's slash value creation toon tv's graphic download level factor powerful player blast could player's funner come start might elder sony alot fighter ray normal title last differently get many theater expansion blow pc take great already different later creature must iv path magazine well fun little faster minor see grow really sets brings course one touch freaking hdtv control whatever back setup showing audio pack bonus regular oblivion reason replay able sound good disk caster type become insane verry list first design come game extremly honestly cool version learn add time game nine hooked blue check everything test cd game also key talk decent see tv install playstation big select release class choice bring monster play comming around two endless hack look system life content call bunch pickup well do get see start look selection stand

2994,95442,3,False,"09 14, 2007",A3LW6FZ12WUX2A,B000K9OP2A,4MaskCurse,"Heavenly Sword,for me,was a HUGE disapointment. First,I will state that good,as I believe this game could have been amazing;maybe even perfect.   1.)Gorgeous graphics,beautiful cinematics and terrific voicework.   2.)Outstanding epic battles very similar to Dynasty Warriors or more recently Genji for PS3. Terrific battle/action cinemas tied with button choreography. Example:rapidly push X to run across the falling rope,or push analog stick in the directions show to to jump up the cliff.   Now the severely unfortunate which lead to a HUGE letdown.   1.)Many times you are switched to Kai,an assasin,and you must ""guide"" the arrows into your targets via the sixaxis controller. This may sound cool, but to be perfectly frank,the controller just doesn't work very good.   There will be plenty of times where the arrow JUST misses the target. You also have to go through this with the cannonball/catapult misson. These missions also have the teeth grinding torture of adding a time limit and if you cannot complete the goal of the misson before the time runs out, or Shen gets killed etc. you get the dreaded instant GAME OVER screen.   To me,that's a huge step backwards in video games to just add  all-or-nothing type elements to a game.   It's extremely annoying and you will become enraged with frustraion. The back of the case for this game never said that you would have to complete ""aim at the target sniper"" missions like this. Had I known,I never would have paid as much money as I did for this.   2.)It feels as though the game developers FORCED the sixaxis controller into the game rather than just letting it come natural,or give the option of whether you want to use it or not. Personally,I think it would have been alot easier and less aggrivating if you just guided the projectile using the analog stick rather than the sixaxis motion.   Many times the extremely cool battles just stop so you have to solve the ""puzzle"" by flinging a shield at a switch. Just think how this affects the game:"" Yeah,I love fighting in this game and killing all these warriors!.... oh.... it's time to hit the switch and open the door.   3.)There are certain attack styles that can cancel out the attacks of your foes;I think speed against power and vice versa. Well, it's hard to know when to switch back and forth when the attacks are coming at you a mile a minute. Oh sure,the attacks are surrounded by a different color aura,but it still doesn't help when you haven't even got your finger on the alternate attack button yet... yes,it's that fast   Also there are many times when all the enemies will do is BLOCK!You can attack them ten thousand times...and still...they JUST BLOCK! HOW ANNOYING!   4.)The total gameplay is only around 6-8 hours;not at all worth the price that I paid. I think that when games are being sold for as much money as they are,there should be a requirement for the gameplay to last AT LEAST 20 hours. I don't care how beautiful the graphics are. Beautiful graphics alone does not make a great game;in fact,it doesn't even make a good game.   There are alot of great ps1 and ps2 games out there that can average 40 to 60 hours of gameplay. They just don't make 'em like they used to. I guess it's just the new generation that has to have the ""oooooooo"" and ""ahhhhh"" effects of eye candy to replace other important elements.   I am going to contact Sony and demand a refund. First of all because they mislead the consumers on what type of game this is,and second because the game was a rushed product with such a short value of gameplay.   I've only played my copy once,and I don't want it in my collection. If there are enough fanboys out there to keep this game and praise it because of how Nariko looks (which is a pretty lame excuse),then they can do so.

2995,123752,2,False,"01 31, 2008",A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B000YIYB3K,Mike,"When I heard about Rail Simulator I was happy to see a railroad simulator back in the market since Train Simulator 2 was cancelled (but restarted for a 2009 release). Train Simulator was a good foundation and the sequel had so much promise. Also, Train Simulators minor expansions were a waist. I found the Trainz franchise too model like and not heavy on the simulation. I love both however. I grew up with Lionel trains and building a decent size layout with my father but our space was limited. Even after 17 years when we first laid out our own track, we miss it but don't have the space to rebuid (obviously I've since moved out). I am a lover of the tycoon and buisness games and while I'm not a huge technofile, I will knitpick at every little detail of a computer game. So I do love both model trains and a deep simulation. What hurt Trainz is it's download content manager. It is a pain in the neck to manage and download content (even to this day). The speed of the downloading depended on the ""ticket"" you bought. If you didn't by the ticket your downloading time was at a snails pace. If you bought a first-class ticket, the speed was way faster. Another problem was that you had to search the for the content and the parts to go with it. If you didn't find it all, it wouldn't work which would prove ot be very frustrating. It was annoying and involved too much work and sometimes upon loading Trainz to play, it acted screwy more times after you started to download content. The manual wasn't a help either.  Now comes Rail Simulator. The newest simulation game using the trains theme. The graphics are very vice; not stunning, but very nice (about 2 notches from being stunning). Much better than Train Simulator and the Trainz Franchise (created by Auran). The people and cars are more realistic in Rail Simulator. Unfortunatley the game fails some major aspects. Shipped in the North American version, 99% of the routes were European. Only one route is from North America (California) and it wasn't even a passenger route. For people who love to drive passanger trains or complete or build passenger routes this was disheartning and  unbelievable. What were they thinking? Even in a PC-DVD you would expect a little more passenger routes. The European routes also were mostly non-passenger. The one I played in Britain was soooo boring, I didn't even get to the first station (it was 34 miles away). I quit the program feeling very depressed because I was looking foward to the game and with all it's hype; it left me with a question: When will anyone create a great buisness/simulator/modeling train simulator. Don't get me started with Sid Meier's Railroads! I read a few articles that although this is a European game, the North American publishers were going to include mostly North American routes and passenger routes as well. This wasn't the case, as I was very disappointed. (How many times have you counted the word disappointed in my review, can you guess if I was disappointed :-) I was also looking at the website where you can register and download content. Not much is available which is ok, since the game was just released. In Trainz: Railroad Simulator 2006, you can go on the download manager and get NYC subway cars and platforms as well as near look-a-like Long Island Railroad cars. None on Rail Simulators. I was shocked to see no Amtrak both as a route included in the game as well as in the download section of the website. When is any train game going to include the NYC subway system, the trollies, the monorail in the Disney area complete with passenger routes, Amtrak's route from NYC to Orlando (AutoTrain), or how about all routes and trains across all of the United States.  Part of me is wondering, for $39.99, seems like they spent most of the money on the graphics because there is hardly any content. Since it is a PC-DVD, I was expecting a lot. Sadly, I was wrong. You click on 3-4 main scenarious and it gives you at most about 4-5 ""jobs"". The original Train Simulator had many more routes.  From startup the installer was perfect and it didn't take long to install. After the initial install, the game worked perfectly, no crashes and no error messages. I hope people will realize that you can't get away with running a computer with 64-512mb of RAM and a video card with 64-128mb of RAM. Onboard graphics is a no-no. If you have any questions about this or need help, don't hesitate to email me.  I hope more routes will be added as I enjoy passenger routes the most. It would be nice for Railroad Simulator to appeal to everyone; ones who like passenger scenarios and industrial scenarios as well. Sadly on this PC-DVD, the passenger scenarios are lacking; as in there are none in North America! The passenger scenarios in Germany can all be done in one day (not totally but you can get drift) and the same goes for Britain as well. I gave the game 2 stars because of the lack of content but with nice graphics/scenery and the fact that people don't look like blocks (they did in Trainz if you were able to see any). One thing that was puzzling was when I was approaching road crossings, the cars never stopped. Some disappeared when they reached the gates. In MSTS, you heard the bells go off and the whistle along with the gate going down. The cars also stopped and formed a line in real life. If it weren't for the graphics, then it would of gotten 1 star. I'm still disappointed and hope more passenger scenarios are added (in North America). It would be nice to drive the Maglev and high speed bullet trains in Japan and in Germany. What about the monorail in Florida (from the transportation and ticket center to all the parks and hotels that it stops at which would make a great passenger scenario). I wish I can drive the NYC subway lines dropping off passengers and picking them up. What about Amtrak/Acela (auto train also), the Long Island Railroad, and New Jersey Transit? Train Simulator had Amtrak's Acela high speed train.  It would of also been nice to see some speaking on the station platforms to announce the inbound and outbound trains and the fact that you see people entering and exiting your train yet you see no movement when you are in passenger mode inside one of the passenger cars. Also it would be nice to see some announcements in the trains to let passengers know what the next stop is as well as the trains route. Wouldn't it be funny if you announce the trains stops and see some passengers quickly get off with a sad look on their face. How about adding licensing, to become an engineer you have to learns about speed limits, traveling at high speeds, braking correctly at station platforms, honking the horn at road crossings, and emergencies and if you fail one of these while on the job, you can get fired. In other words, follow the rules or else you would have to find work at another railroad company. If you did such a poor job or killed someone you wouldn't be able to find another job and the game ends. Incorportating a business sim would be interesting. I know this isn't a tycoon game but it certainly would keep you entertained. You could buy locomotives and additional passenger cars and get and increase ridership. You can raise fairs (multiple types), have to pay your workers (ticket agents, cleaning crew and mechanics), and maintain stations and their platforms as well as maintaining your railyard to make it efficient. You can build/create routes in all cities in the United States and Canada (subway or above gound).  Did the developers do their homework? Did they purposely leave out most of North America? The California scenarios are non-passenger ones and this is it in the United States. Did they purposley concentrate on mostly non-passenger scenarious for a future expansion? Will there be future expansions for North America?  Concerning the manual. These days most games don't come with manuals or they have it as a pdf file on the disc. For people who jump right into the game and learn as they go (like me), it doesn't bother me that there was no manual in the box. For people who do read the manuals, the pdf file is easy to access. The minor issue you might have is printing it out and using up your paper supply. Maybe the company was thinking that most people don't pay attention to the manual and jump right in....perhaps to cut costs. Who knows. There's a small pamphlet explaining the controls which is pretty straight foward in understanding. There is a very small ""guide"" in the box but you would think since there is no manual inside this ""guide"" would be a lot thicker. As for me, I'm waiting for Train Simulator 2 but I haven't given up hope for this one. This game needs and I hope it gets more content! Disappointed; Yes. Given up on it; No!
