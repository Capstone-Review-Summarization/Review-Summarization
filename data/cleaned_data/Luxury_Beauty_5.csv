The information on the package and bottle stated this product would diminish the appearance of wrinkle lines. Those lines on your forehead, under eyes, around lips. I took a small amount and applied it to my crows feet and blended it into the lines. At first indeed, the lines looked somewhat diminished and smoother. I did not notice any lifting of my face around the lines, and after awhile, an hour or two my crows feet were back to it's wrinkly appearance.  This product is supposed to take the place of Botox injections, or at the least the effect is supposed to be equal to Botox. I have not had Botox, but I have seen the effects, and the softening of lines for an hour or two is not the same. I would use this cream when I am going out for the evening or to an important event.

I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.  As far as low-key colors go, it's good for work, play and about anything else.

Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.  Overall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

In the past 3 years, I wore imPRESS nails which I loved & I've been using do it yourself LED (light) nail polish which I also love.  The problem is, I tend to pull the imPRESS nails off & pick at the LED polish instead of removing it properly.  Both these bad habits made my peeling nails worse & I've been having trouble strengthening them again.  Through the years, I've used a few different nail strengtheners.  I have a couple favorite brands that  when used according to directions they protect & harden my nails enough that my nails grow out again.  Their (my nails) nature is to peel, so eventually they'll begin peeling...no matter how healthy they are. I also found a filler polish which helps even out the ridges caused by peeling layers.  I've been testing Julep Take A Breather Oxygen Nail Treatment for about two weeks now.  It seems to act as a filler & a nail hardener.  It is a milky pink color which when applied looks more sheer.  It seems to hide imperfections pretty good...my peeled layers look much nicer & smoother.  It also hardens my nail. (I test this by trying to bend my nails that have peeled & are thinner on the edges) I've been applying two coats, then wait a few days and apply another.  I've found that I don't like the looks of the polish when I use 4 or more coats.  For me to have the polish look presentable, I should remove the polish on about day 5 & start over.  This polish does seem to chip easier than some polishes. According to instructions, it works best if used alone so I haven't applied additional color on top of it. It is a sheer pink which looks milky pink but when applied it is sheer & surprisingly helps hide & smooth my peeled layers. The polish becomes more opaque when 4 or more coats have been applied.  However, I don't like the looks of the polish if I use more than 3 coats. The container looks like it would easily tip over, but its weight helps keep it upright.  Even at that I am more cautious when using it, especially when I remove excess polish from the brush.  I'm now at the two week mark of using this polish continually, as instructed, and it seems to be working. I like the way it helps hide/cover/fill-in the layers caused by my peeling nails.  It doesn't completely hide them, but definitely improves their appearance.","After two week test on nails that peel - it is strengthening my nails, my nails are growing out &  helps hide peeled layers",1471046400,,,look hardens presentable protect much additional oxygen week i've use peel nail way upright smooth like loved sheer treatment however week accord properly harden completely brush nature favorite hardener bad enough wait pink opaque eventually pick nail take cause problem seem tip definitely test color act trouble coat different hide/cover/fill-in begin cautious find imperfection appearance surprisingly apply bend grow healthy love mark polish make julep layer remove apply pull try help breather easy chip nicer instruction use couple day hide strengthener light weight lead they'll alone improve test impress especially would peel top continually bad also good...my thinner work even edge brand start matter easily filler remove day year wear excess tend smooth container instruct milky strengthen i'm peel best becomes two work ridge instead look seem direction peeling...no use past another apply keep habit polish pretty

You pay a lot, you agonize over ingredients you look at reviews and then... wait and see if it has any effect at all. If this product was sold as really thick moisturizing cream with natural ingredients I'd give it 5 stars. I think the thickness people have complained about is because either their skin type is more oily or they're not used to natural products that in my experience are less absorbent or at least slower. I used this product over several days while in SF with my gf--we were staying with my mom. I mention this because we got a wide variety of skin types to test this product out. As mentioned early it is thick on everyone. The apple smell is amazing. The age defy part though... thats a little nebulous. My mother who's in her 50's  saw little change, but loved it as a before bed leave on product. She swore in the morning it filled in some of the lines. As thick as this product is, and as long as it takes to set in, I can very much believe that it does rejuvenate some of the dry lines in her face, though it was hard for us to notice anything... but she seemed to like it so thats something? My partner who's in her 20's hated this product. Her skin is naturally very oily and she thought it felt slick and thick and just not pleasant. Her laugh lines and slight lines around her eyes saw zero change. She was the first to stop using it after just a few applications because she just hated how it felt and had to wipe it down to apply makeup even an hour later. Lastly I was probably the most apathetic about it. My skin is drier so I didn't mind the thickness, especially right before bed. It still took a little longer than I would have liked to absorb, but I didn't have any major problems like my gf. But that being said I also didn't see any major benefit over this and any other thicker natural moisturizer I've used from kiehls or even neutrogena Norwegian formula.  All in all 2oz isn't great, but its about standard for a high end beauty product so while its not great in the value department its not bad as these things go. And if you realize its a heavier product for either exclusively nighttime use or for very dry skin, that will probably do more to keep you from having weathered skin than anything to actually reverse the process you're gonna get more use out of it.

100,31132,4,False,"06 20, 2016",AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B01DQ1CEMG,,Nerd Alert,"I have used a couple IPL systems before, including a different Silk'n model and the Philips Lumea.  Both work well, and I was excited to try out this system that promised to be more compact for getting into tight places.  Unfortunately, it is almost identical to the Lumea, and I don't say that to be dramatic.  It is seemingly the same unit with a purple trim portion and carrying case.  Thankfully, the Lumea is a nice unit, but my hopes of a smaller detail hair removal tool were dashed.  My guess is that only very specific models have been FDA approved, limiting the diversity in home systems.  If you are new to IPL, I will try to give a brief overview.  The IPL system has emits a burst of light at a frequency that is absorbed by pigmented areas, with the goal being to heat up the base of the hair follicles enough to damage them.  With repeated use over months and years, the hair will grow back thinner and more slowly, making it much easier to keep smooth.  So, this will only work on relatively light skin and relatively dark hair.  If your skin is dark, it will absorb the light before it gets to the hair root.  That means it won't work, plus it might burn you.  The more pigmented areas of the body like the genitals or thicker hair density areas like a man's face are not advised for these home systems, but certainly they are done with more powerful systems in a clinical setting.  I think the main point of that warning is to avoid liability.  If you choose to do it anyway, start with the lower intensity light to make sure you don't burn yourself.  As with the Lumea, you can hold the button down between flashes to cause it to flash as soon as it is ready.  That makes going over large areas easier than the original Silk'n.  Since it has the same shape head, with a large border, it is awkward to use under the nose or other creases.  However, it can be done.  Even large areas are pretty quick and the pain isn't bad if you have pale skin.  For home use, this is as good as it gets right now.  It's still a bit clunky and low powered compared to professional treatments, but persistence does pay off.  Don't expect quick results and be disciplined and you'll likely be pleased.  The main alternative is doing electrolysis, but I find that challenging without causing scarring on myself.","Works Well, But Identical to Lumea",1466380800,7.0,,give man's nice cause awkward heat much base detail brief use find head work approve persistence button excite smooth like result model however powerful clunky pigment compact follicle skin pay might emit try guess think flash professional hold unit pale tight liability hop dark shape enough certainly system expect clinical sure make different mean pain burn unfortunately density nose silk'n grow place tool genitals face model new back challenge original slowly advise removal right relatively hair point compare low soon go easier likely home good setting treatment limit quick use large couple dash scar warn ready bit flash light almost absorbed month repeat carry thicker burst damage please trim bad discipline thinner promise area anyway overview small still electrolysis even start ipl root year lumea identical make choose main case plus avoid seemingly since purple pretty intensity absorb fda power without system include specific body make philip cause diversity well alternative goal get say thankfully dramatic frequency get do border lower keep crease portion

To my eye, after using this for several weeks, a scar that I have on the side of my neck appears lighter and less noticeable - perhaps the effects of the niacin/vitamin B, or perhaps just from being moisturized daily.  In any case, it's an improvement.  I'm glad that I read the other reviews before I began to use this, because it did cause a reddening appearance and a slight burning feeling when I tested it out the first time.  I used my wrist as a test spot, and the redness went away after a few minutes, so I went ahead and tried it on my neck.  It did get a little red and warm feeling for a bit, but this decreased to the point where it is unnoticeable after 2 weeks.  I absolutely think that they should put this as a warning on the side of the jar.  The cream itself, outside of the health effects, is nice to use, although not my favorite.  It seems that some people can smell a weird or chemically smell from it, and some can't or enjoy the smell.  I fall into the first category.  The smell, to me, seems like compost or soured greens.  I'm not a big fan.  The feel of the cream is cushiony but I find it slightly greasy compared to some of my other creams.

156,31561,2,False,"01 9, 2017",A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,B01FB6G8GM,{'Size:': ' 0.67 fl. oz'},Gen of North Coast Gardening,"Some background: I have been doing a Korean 10 step beauty routine, or some iteration of it, for the last six months or so, and prior to that I was using facial cleanser, serum, and either a moisturizer or a moisturizing facial oil for some time, so I'm familiar with using oils and some of the strategies for making them work. For example, if I'm having a hormonal day where I feel like I might break out, I apply the oil onto my wet hands and rub it around first before applying to my face to kind of dilute the oil and keep me from breaking out. Other times when I need more moisture, I rubbed the oil onto my dry hands and apply directly.  I have tried a variety of beauty oils for the face, and I usually like ones with the most natural ingredients, though I do intersperse them with using a regular moisturizer just because I find a lot of the oils sit on my face and don't sink in quite as effectively as I might hope. That said, they provide a great barrier of protection for those days when I have to be outside more, because I work as a landscaper there are a lot of days when I am in the elements.  This oil falls short in the ingredients department into really notable ways: first, the artificial fragrance is absolutely awful. On first sniff, it's not too bad, however I'm not used to having a facial oil be fragranced. Given that fragrance is one of the primary skin irritants, and given the fact that people usually use facial oils when they have delicate, sensitive, or aging skin, why in the world would they muck up a premium product by adding such a common irritant that many people don't like? I can tell you that if I want to smell the fragrance on my skin all day, it won't be something like this  I would instead carefully select a fragranced lotion or perfume. I don't look to my facial oil to provide a fragrant ambience to my day.  Then, later in the ingredients it contains hydrogenated vegetable oil. I don't know about you, but when I cook with vegetable oil, it tends to break me out. I don't see any justification at all for putting hydrogenated vegetable oil in such an expensive facial oil product. There are wonderful facial oils on the market that are fairly inexpensive in comparison to this  definitely less than half of the retail price, that do not contain any of this junk. In addition, you can find ones for cheaper that have coldpressed or organic ingredients. Just here locally, I have a number of vendors blending up beautiful, simple facial oil blends with truly high-end ingredients and they do not charge so much money for them.  I can't speak to the long-term effects of using this oil because I couldn't tolerate it. In fact, on the first day of using, I had to wash my face multiple times to try to get the fragrance off, because it was making my face well and making me need to sneeze. The fragrance is not that bad, I am just extremely sensitive to fragrance on my skin care products. However, I use a number of Korean beauty products and even though a few of them do have fragrance, the vast majority don't have anything like this. I've also used a lot of lush facial products, all of which do have some natural essential oil fragrance, and those don't bother me either. This really smells like a drugstore shampoo, and why in the world they would put it on a facial oil, I really can't tell you.  There is some good stuff in here, but the fact that it's overshadowed by an overbearing fragrance and a few questionable ingredients, plus a lack of organic or coldpressed oils, makes me think that the price tag is just due to Cindy Crawford's name and not due to the ingredients. It's a shame.

It did take three coats to become opaque, instead of the usual two.  However, since it's mostly glitter without a base color, that's not too bad.  I used a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat (no base coat) and it helped this polish to dry quickly.  I thought the brush was nice.  I kind of don't like the rectangular ""extra"" black cap on top of the applicator, though.  It seems like a waste of plastic and it was a little difficult for me to remove, for some reason.  However, overall, this is a good polish -- even if it's been sitting around for close to a year (just shake it up a bit) and I think I will get many uses out of it.

I have combination skin, so take that as you will.  If I apply this after my normal cleansing ritual and before applying moisturizer, it does reduce the look of fine lines (and I'm a former smoker, so I'm always happy to reduce the appearance of wrinkles which prematurely aged my skin through my own folly), but the effect does not seem to be permanent and fades after a few hours.

I've tried several beauty serums - mostly free samples - and thus far have not found one which works on my skin to produce the purported effects which the marketing departments claim.  On the other hand, this serum is organic and not full of nasty chemicals. It has a pleasant scent which I did not find overpowering.  It is also not oily and did not make me break out, as many of the beauty serums have done in the past, so I consider that a win, as well.  Although I do not believe that this serum has had a permanent age-reversing effect on my skin, as a temporary measure, it works very well.

But this does not interact with my moisturizer, primer or foundation makeup, so it's just a mild inconvenience.

The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass.

Inside are small capped vials intended to provide one application.  There is also a ""dropper"" that screws onto the bottle (with cap removed) to dab your scalp with the ""liquid"".  Similar to dying your hair/roots.  The enclosed instructions are woefully incomplete.  Basically says, ""make three straight lines down your scalp"" (and massage in).  Three lines?  Where...side-to-side?  front-to-back?  There are youtubes available, but I wasn't in the mood to sit through a video when I just wanted to test the product.  So I focused on the areas of where my hair is thinning the most and then randomly dabbed, massaged in, added my usual small amount of gel & leave-in conditioner and partially blow-dried.  If I use too much in one area, the combination of my hair and the liquid leaves my hair feeling somewhat clumped and like it's dirty (my fault).  If I'm patient, it absorbs well.  My hair did ""feel"" like it was more full upon drying (though that isn't part of its claim).  Recommended to use three times to freshly washed damp hair (and then dry as usual) per week.  I'm skeptical these days, but after two weeks (9 applications), something DOES FEEL different.  I know that isn't scientific and vague, but I'm still curious to see the results after a month's use.  (and I will update then)  Where I can definitely feel a difference is when I condition (after shampoo) and rinse out the conditioner, I have nowhere near the hair in my hands than before using this product.  The claim is that it anchors the hair to the follicle ~ and to that note, I do have far less hair loss after conditioning/rinsing.  Recommended is 3 months use and if my results continue in this positive direction, I feel encouraged to purchase two more sets at their pricey amount.

This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

I suppose I let my past experience with Henckels build up my expectations. I thought this would be the best grooming said I had ever seen, but it turned out to be just pretty good.  This trio of devices is packaged in a little leather pouch with a snap. The pieces didn't fit all too well in the pouch, and I got an immediate sense of cheapness in the whole presentation. The leather pouch comes in a bag which comes in a box, but after all those steps, what you see is kind of a let down. The pieces are shiny silver in that Henckels way, looking a lot like our knives actually.  The manually-operated nose hair clipper was painful. It looks like something  that should have a battery, but you hand turn it. My nose hairs got caught and pulled, ouch. Not a great experience. The other pieces were better.

A note to the reader:  I will do my best to give you a fair, accurate, and unbiased view of this skin care product.  Like most people, I feel that if something goes on my face it should be gentle and beneficial.  It is not acceptable that there should be discomfort or harmful effects.  To that end, this is a good product in that it meets those basic criteria.  It is gentle, easy to use, pleasant smelling, and it leaves the face looking better without excessive redness or ""blotchiness"".  It does feel nice and soothing on the skin  Others have reported a tingling sensation- I would agree, although it is only slight, there is no pain, and this tingling is transient.  I also do not leave this exfoliant peel on longer than 10 minutes.  I tried the sensitive skin product-it is a lot less `caustic' and harsh than other hydroxy acid products that are available.  After use, the face is glowing, slightly pinker, and moist. There is no flaking, burning, or drying. The skin feels super clean, plumper, hydrated,  and perhaps more `balanced'.  The skin tone looks more even and improved after use.  I have used it several times about every 7-10 days. without  noticing any ill effect. I've not  had to discontinue use for any reasons.  There has been no rash or skin outbreak.  With any new skin product (new to me), I patch test it first:  Before liberal use/application, apply a small amount to an area you can monitor (such as the under belly of the forearm). I see they recommend trying it behind the ear (I like the forearm better-easier to regulate). If no itching or redness develops, it is not likely that an allergy has occurred.  You might then want to try more use and greater distribution.  But, when in doubt, always stop use and consult your physician.  JUICE BEAUTY has a nice web site-take a look. It's quite informative and readily details their skin care philosophy and `mission statement'.  The components of their skin care line are discussed.  Chiefly, they use a blend of fruit stem cells infused into a Vitamin C, resveratrol-rich grape seed formula. This line of organic products uses natural and organically found chemical ingredients that are found in the fruit stem cells of apples, grapes and lemons.  This skin care line is somewhat unique in that it makes use of resveratrol-a naturally occurring helpful chemical commonly found in grape seeds.  In the past, it was less common to find that in a readily accessible product.  ""JUICE BEAUTY skin care products are made with naturally occurring chemicals found in fruit and are never made with  petroleum by-products, `parabens,or propylene or butylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfates,  pesticides, phthalates. No artificial or synthetic dyes or fragrances are present in this product line.""  As the skin tolerates this well and there is a good result, I will incorporate this Green Apple Peel into my facial skin care regimen and I plan to continue using this after this initial sample is done.  I am pleased with this product, no complaints.  EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database rates the Juice Beauty  products quite favorably-among the best ratings out there.

In the last couple of years, I've also been using their honey lip balm and several of their moisturizers, and have really liked them all.  While I do love the cooling sensation of this new body spray (for that's essentially what it is), it has a really strong floral scent to it that lasts for several hours, meaning that you wouldn't want to use perfume when you use this.  It's a really cloying scent -- one that smells strongly of baby powder. I know that scents are a very personal thing, but this one just feels outdated and is very strong.  The positives are that this comes in a beautiful frosted glass bottle, and the spray mechanism works to evenly coat your skin.  It looks beautiful on the vanity or bathroom counter.  Despite those positives, though, I may pass this along to a friend because the scent is just too much for me personally.  My advice is to try to smell this before purchasing, or only purchase if you like floral, powdery scents.","Has a strong smell, but it feels cooling for the summer",1466812800,,,"know look evenly honey baby much i've use scent like dry lip hour smell skin try glass meaning counter last strongly several sensation thing feel frost advice huile love&nbsp;<a multi-purpose purchasing cloying outdated really smell that's one despite like love personally new prodigieuse beautiful spray perfume bathroom scent positive use couple come want purchase friend also coat bottle powder work oz.</a data-hook=""product-link-linked powdery vanity class=""a-link-normal year fl cool moisturizers pass oil last along floral though body mechanism gift balm use essentially strong may personal give absolutely"

It's like it magically last 24 hours bc I've ""checked "" myself the next day & thought I can use my old deo.  Oh no, 2 hours into my sweaty shift, I was reminded why I love this deo.  Upgrading to 5 stars.  Btw, does soothe after shave as well.  Original review- First, I have to say~ I thought when I read this was a cream I was going to have to put it on with my finger which made me a bit hesitant to try.  The tube has a rounded tip that allows you to squeeze & apply like a roll on. So bonus point right there. (See pic)  The tube is about 3 inches long so, about half the size of a roll on/stick & travel friendly.  You squeeze tube until 1/2"" of cream comes out and rub it into your skin with the rounded tip like applying lotion.  Now, a little background on what this deodorant was up against... (Poor guy had no idea of the torture it was about to encounter)  I work special events in formal wear ( White long sleeve shirt, black polyester vest And tie, black pants) in the Florida humid, sticky, brutal heat.  I carry deodorant & body spray with me because no matter what I use, after about an hour... I can't stand the smell of myself.  My uniform creates a sauna of heat with no escape.  All I can say it's after 8 hours running, sweat dripping from my face, I'm clean.  Now this is a deodorant not anti persperant so it's not designed to keep you dry but I'm pretty fresh.  It goes on white & creamy so maybe not little black dress approved but this will save you in the summer heat.  There is no scent so should work on the masses.  All I can say is, I took a chance on this because I love my Vichy after shower skin firming cream in the pink tub & I'm glad I did.  This is a game changer.  Thank you Vichy!!

This is the sort of scent I adore....with green & woodsy notes, rather than a face full of florals! I feel as if I'm in a forest after a light rain. Heaven!  The top note is certainly a bit fruity, sweet, and powdery. I also get grassy undertones. There's a distinct ""greenness"" that opens up this fragrance. It then settles into a smoky, spicy scent where the nutmeg is detectable as the sweetness fades. Citadelle then settles into it's primary basenote, a heady VETIVER dry down. That's where this fragrance really shines. The vetiver base lasts and lasts. Silage (longevity) for me is about 4 hours, which is very good for me....I find that most perfume doesn't last a long time on me unless it's cloying. But if you're looking for a scent that lasts all day, this isn't it. It's a LIGHT fragrance, very wearable for work, not heavy and does not ""project"".  One of my all time favorite perfumes is Sycomore by Chanel. It's very expensive, a scent I've saved only for special occasions. Citadelle reminds me of a lighter version of Sycomore, in many ways more wearable because it has less of a dark/heavy feeling about it. This is a scent that can be worn year round, rather than just saving it for Fall/Winter months. If you love Vetiver & tree/green smelling perfumes, you'll enjoy Citadelle. It's certainly more affordable than Chanel, or Encre Noir by Lalique and the lightness of it will win over those who feel that those scents are a bit too heavy and overbearing.  Unisex? Yes! My husband likes this scent very much. This fragrance is in no way too girly. No floral notes anywhere! But he'll have to get his own bottle....this one is MINE and I'm not giving it up.

A lot of plant based or all natural treatments contain aloe, which Im allergic to.  So I was very glad to see that this treatment for lips didnt.  It does promise a lot, though.  Its supposed to visibly reduce the appearance of vertical lines, smooth, soften, and plump the delicate lip area.  Also, lipstick will glide on beautifully and you can say goodbye to lipstick bleed!  This lip treatment is different than anything Ive ever tried.  Its neither a balm nor a gloss and its not in a tube.  Its a very light cream (the box describes it as delicate) and its in a tiny little jar. It has a very light, very soft feel to it as it goes on.  Unlike practically anything else Ive ever used on my lips, this product absorbs into the lips really quickly.  And while it doesnt leave a waxy or greasy layer on the lips, you definitely know its there  lips are moisturized, soft, and rosy (even though its not tinted at all). A little goes a long way, which is great considering the price.  I haven't been using it long, only about two weeks.  So I cant really say if it will ever really reduce the signs of aging around my mouth.  But I have noticed that my lips look healthier. Ive always had a huge problem with chapping and peeling  I have lip balms stuck everywhere because of it  and that has not been as severe since Ive been using the VENaffect.  In fact, I don't reach for the lip balm as much as I used to.  Lipstick does go on smoother when using it and it stays truer to color because the balm isn't watering it down. Actually, I prefer to put it on before any other makeup and smooth it in the area around my lips, too.  Its not exactly the type of thing Id want to carry around in one of my nice handbags for fear it the lid would come off  it would take up more space than a tube of balm anyway.  I try to use it at least three times per day: in the morning under my lipstick, before I go to the gym, and then again before bed.  The only sticking point for me, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars, is the price.  Eighty five dollars ($85.00) is a lot of money to pay for a tiny jar of lip cream.

This potion is very smooth and silky going on, and covers very well.  Almost like it's skimming along the surface of your skin more so than being absorbed by it, although after a bit of time it seems to be 'in' the skin. It has a pleasant scent, but does leave a slightly sticky residue on your hands and face. (Very noticeable as flakes on the skin if too much product is used.)  The product's website details this product in the following way:  ""This powerful, dual-action anti-aging serum helps visibly lift skin and acts as a non-invasive line filler to help temporarily smooth out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It contains a rare, exclusive orchid extract which comes from the Emerald Coast of France and is designed to enhance natural production of healthy collagen and elastin in the skin.""  It's part of a skin care line that if used regularly promises amazing results. Unfortunately I don't have the entire line to try out, but this 'filler' - used to temporarily smooth fine lines and wrinkles - is a good product from my brief usage of it. It does add a moisturized layer to the skin; especially around the eyes, that gives the skin a plumper appearance.  Used underneath my mineral make-up, I noticed a subtle, positive difference.  I do get a slight blotchy redness right after applying it, and some very minor tingling.  This does disappear rather quickly though. I think using less is actually better and it may not be necessary to smooth it all over your face as much as the areas around your neck, mouth and eyes.  This product is expensive by comparison to other products I've used and I look forward to giving it at least 30 days to work its magic. Ideally I would use it for 3 months, but I'm not sure there's that much product in this 1 fl oz bottle.  I'll definitely update this review the longer I use the product to let Amazon shoppers know my experience with it over an extended period of time.  --------------------------------------  UPDATE:  7/18/16 - After a month of consistent use I can say this product works very well to make my whole face and neck feel moisturized.  My skin seems plumper - more elastisity - and does seem to make the appearance of fine lines (especially around my eyes) significantly less noticable.  This stuff is really remarkable in the sense that it takes one pump (very small amount) to get full coverage.  My 49 year old skin is generally fairly dry so I was afraid this product would be sucked in never to be seen again.  Much to my delight it went on silky smooth, with no oily residue.  The inital red, blotchy skin reaction I got when I used it went away within a week of use. Maybe my skin got used to it?  Really smooth applicaiton with no tingling after two weeks of use.  On the downside, it's not ideal with mineral make-up.  What generally had a matte appearance became more 'oily' looking.

This brand is new to me.  I have the ""ProQuinoa complex"" conditioner with sage since it appears that multiple items have been listed on this page in the past.  My particular hair concerns were frizz and color protection.  I have naturally light colored hair that I dye black, and it can get kind of brassy looking in the summer.  And I exercise a lot, so I have to wash my hair every day.  My hair tends to dry out because of this, which leads to frizz, since I live in Georgia and it is summertime.  I find that my hair soaks this up a lot more than it does with conditioners that have more oil in them (this has coconut oil, but it is pretty far down the ingredients list).  Unfortunately, that means I have to use a lot of this product to get good coverage.  That is one reason I have taken off a star -- I am going to run out of this very quickly.  With regards to color protection, my hairdresser did a semi-permanent color rinse a few weeks back to try to get rid of some of the brassiness (in her professional opinion this would look best and I trust her judgment).  And, that is still working, despite shampooing and conditioning my hair every day in between.  My roots (with permanent dye) are also looking good.  So I am happy with the color protection aspect of this product.  With respect to frizz, this isn't doing as much as I'd like.  It does promise to smooth and soften the hair, and it kind of delivers on that.  My hair is definitely softer afterwards.  And I think I am seeing fewer flyaways.  So it is OK but not great in that regard.  (I use detanglers and oils afterwards to control frizz and if you do that, this could still work for you.)  It may be just too difficult to overcome the Georgia summer humidity.  But I still have to use all my anti-frizz products after I wash my hair.  For the ""ProQuinoa"" complex conditioner, I am not sure the ingredients list in the product images is up to date.  Here is the most recent version I could find (as of August 2016):  Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Lauryl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Bromide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Citric Acid, , Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Coconut Oil, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Barley Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sage Oil, Sage Leaf Extract, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl-3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Phenoxyethanol, Mica, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides).  I think maybe the reason I am not getting the results I want is because the ingredients that work for me in conditioners (oils and silicones) are far down the list here, so there isn't much of them.  This is not to say this is a bad product, just that it's not 100% appropriate for my hair type.  If frizz and flyaways aren't concerns for you, and your hair isn't particularly dry, or if you have finer hair and don't want to use a strongly oil-based conditioner, but want some color protection, this may be perfect.  If you have thicker, coarser, drier hair like I do, though, this will not be anything special.",not the best for my hair type but will work for some people,1471910400,2.0,,cetyl product barley fill black leaf much detanglers week find use maybe coarser star work complex lauryl acid wash rid ci glycerin smooth like protection result appear dye dry oil curator pay could semi-permanent product try think perfect brassiness exercise professional conditioner protein strongly aspect get delivers behentrimonium finer i'd tend mica dimethicone regard definitely anti-frizz sure great multiple color take proquinoa mean dioxide phenoxyethanol root iron oxide interested happy subscription date hydrolyze box unfortunately naturally ok brand carboxaldehyde citric few fee one rinse despite page extract appropriate lot new flyaways image back august cetrimonium frizz limonene hair bimonthly coconut far coverage permanent recent live reason bromide kind go good cetearyl type quickly judgment chooses list panthenol item conditioner trust methosulfate cinnamidopropyltrimonium titanium light want list version quinoa color shampoo would particular thicker particularly georgia concern bad also promise regard still soy water receive soften day lead opinion summer difficult humidity oil-based silicone soak summertime ingredient special stearyl oil since fragrance shtrands sage best drier work condition soft look though run quiz call brassy alcohol respect hairdresser past base get say see every afterwards may look chloride anything pretty control overcome

I also tend to splurge on facial products so I liked the notion of something that would enhance the effectiveness of what I've already been using.  I've been also using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarisonic-Mia-2-Sonic-Skin-Cleansing-System-Lavender/dp/B00B9UE8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarisonic Mia 2 Sonic Skin Cleansing System, Lavender</a>&nbsp;which claims to improve your skin's absorption of Vitamin C, but this was the first topical product I've seen that claims to boost performance of your skin care routine.  To give context to the rest of the review, I'm a 30-something with skin that is acne-prone but also sensitive and dry as a side effect of two rounds of Accutane in the past.  As a result, I look for products that make my skin look soft and hydrated, while avoiding things that overly irritate my skin or aggravate breakouts.  When opening this product I first appreciated how well packaged it is.  My bottle came tightly sealed in plastic and not a drop was unaccounted for.  Given how expensive this is per ounce I much appreciated that none is wasted.  The instructions, however, leave a lot to be desired.  It seems to be one instruction sheet for many StriVectin products.  In fact, at first I thought it was a sheet for the wrong product until I realized the Booster Oil was mentioned, just for only a couple of sentences.  It's a shame because with a product this expensive I always want to better understand how it works and how to best apply it for maximum effectiveness.  Here the instructions were simple and straight forward.  Apply 2-3 drops to my face with or without moisturizer and then follow up with my usual serum.  It didn't specify that it had to be StriVectin Serum so I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ole-Henriksen-Truth-Serum-Collagen-Booster-1-7-oz/dp/B007W0JA70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ole Henriksen Truth Serum Collagen Booster 1.7 oz</a>&nbsp;because that's what I'm using at the moment.  When I went to apply this the first thing I realized was that I didn't love the application process.  Essentially you screw off the lid to reveal a dropper.  I like that the dropper gives you a precise measurement of how much you need, but I don't like that the rest of the container is essentially open making it easy to spill.  All the other pricy serums I've used have had more of a pump-type dispenser which makes it harder to spill or waste product.  Applying it to my skin was also tricky because 2-3 drops didn't seem to go very far. Adding it to moisturizer does seem to make it easier to apply to the entire face.  However it does make me wonder if it will make this booster lose its effectiveness and potency because many of the topical prescription products I've used for my face have specified applying it to a clean face and letting it absorb fully before adding lotion.  When applied without the lotion it feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.  Even though it is an oil you are applying so little to your skin that it doesn't feel greasy.  The scent isn't overly pleasant but thankfully is also not noxious and seemed to dissipate quickly enough.  I then followed up as directed with my serum.  Generally I find these things take a couple months to fully see the effects so I plan to report back after I've had more experience with this product to see whether it does seem to be boosting my skincare routine and how long the bottle lasts.

So I'm happy about that. And I've found it does extremely well with a BB cream I just tried!  So, perhaps I shall go with the 4 stars. If I like the brush, and if I would recommend it, and purchase it if I lost it or it became too old, then it deserves my stars. (Though, knowing me, I'd try to find it on sale, or one like it for less :D ) This is one of those updates I love to add, when I determine that the product is better than I first thought and I'm sold! ----  Rating Explanation: Really, 3.5 stars (4.0 for the softness and for how foundation doesn't cake onto the brush and how it blends in well; 3.0 stars for bristles falling out and the price being a little high compared to my usual foundation brush, which was half the price and does the job well, too)  General Description: A small, handle-textured, soft-bristled 'buffing' brush--black, with a tiny loop with which to hang it (after washing or if you want to hang it otherwise). Price now: about $21.00  General Comments: Makeup brushes can be expensive, but I probably would not spend $21 on this brush since on first use some of the bristles fell out--not many, mind you, but after that happened I read a few other reviews and found that after washing this has happened. With my experience, it was right out of the box I lost some bristles as I applied my foundation as directed. So, for review purposes, after one use, I gently washed it - as I did, a few more fell out (again, not very many). After drying, I used it again and a few more came out. In all total, there were not very many bristles to fall out but this does make me wonder if this is normal upon first few uses -- that in manufacturing some bristles are going to be loose and with use this will stop, or if with continued use and washing more and more bristles will fall out. Time will tell but this does seem to be an issue with this brush.  Applying Foundation: As the instructions indicated, I applied liquid foundation right to the brush. I placed just a tiny amount, for I wanted to do this in a layering application. I swirled the small dab of foundation on half my face (for comparison with my regular makeup brush on the other side). The brush is extremely soft on my face--this I did like very much. And my makeup disappeared into my skin quite quickly. I put just a little more foundation on the brush and swirled that into the same side of my face and again it disappeared. It was a nice finish, I will say. When I applied my foundation with my regular flat-bristled foundation brush on the other side of my face as I usually do it, I really could not tell that much of a difference, though there may have been a slight difference, but not enough I could really say for sure. My foundation brush is half the price of this one.  Positive Point: 4.0 stars for this: One difference between this brush and my regular foundation brush that interested me is that my regular foundation brush you can see the residue of makeup on it, but the Japonesque didn't have any residue that I could see! That in itself was pretty amazing. Perhaps with more use it would but I believe with small applications and swirling it in thoroughly, most of the makeup would end up on your face and not left on the brush--which is a good thing.  Negative Point: bristles falling out, and the loop is pretty small--not sure where I'm to hang it.  I would like to try this with mineral makeup (I am out of that right now) to see how it does but I expect it to do well with mineral (""powder"") make up.

It is also a scent that lasts, which I take as a mark of Proraso quality. They seem to really care about the quality of their products.  The Green menthol cream is the original Proraso and many people swear by that cream. However, I did not like the smell of that cream at all, as I thought it was just awful. I would bear it in order to use the cream, but I hated the smell. Also, I do think this is better at taming a thicker beard than the original (though that could just be their marketing working on me). It definitely doesn't dry your skin out as much as the menthol original and that is a big deal to me. This is now my new favorite Proraso product. I just wish they had come out with an aftershave lotion that matched this scent at the same time. Hopefully, they will do so soon.",Better than the green.,1363824000,,,beard wetshaving hated product soupy much use amount think double scent like order however dry legendary smell scent could among know beard skin come usually product think menthol tame specifically get favorite truer many market take definitely lather cream big triple wetshavers well lotion sandalwood thick really smell course mark shave green new term quality original deal peppery right exact aftershave rival soon good price cannot creams time hopefully would thicker particular comment also bear proraso water forgive easily mix swear design process work last though seem match people overly say awful manly wish care

While it's much better than cheap flat irons, what I don't like about it is you can't adjust the heat (it gets VERY hot) and it makes my hair very flat. Straight, but flat. I was eager to see how this T3 Micro Single Pass Luxe compares, especially being so expensive.  First, the packaging is luxurious. It comes in a beautiful box with a lid. Inside you find an elegant iron and two hair clips, plus an envelop containing the instructions and a heat-resistant resting pad. Of course, looks don't really matter (only performance does), but it's a pretty presentation nonetheless.  This iron comes with multiple heat setting, which is a big, big plus. Although my hair is curly, the strands are very silky--thus, easy to straighten. I don't need sky-high temps (like the CHI) to straighten my hair.  The plates are so smooth that they glide down the hair effortlessly. The first few times I had to look closely because it seemed like they weren't even touching my hair (they were).  The end result?

Again, as a Floridian, I heard of people complaining about cracked, dry skin, but I didn't realize how bad it could get.  After reading numerous reviews, I see that many people use this Rose water to help with dry skin.  That's so amazing that you can actually use something natural to help. I do remember my grandmother would always spray a spritz of rosewater on her skin at night.  She always smelled so good and who knew that it was keeping her skin so soft?  So After returning home with the misery of dry skin, we tried the spray. It seems to work very well to moisturize and soften the skin.  It does have a very pleasant smell, one that takes me back to my childhood. When I first sprayed it, it feels very cool. After it dries,  I do notice that my skin feels soft.  The product literature recommends spraying your face each night before bed. I will continue this regimen to see if it actually helps.

If you do not, then the fibers might get on your pillowcase.  With a new bottle, I peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.  You do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. Part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. You may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. If you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. It does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.  This would not work well for extensive baldness (nothing does!), but works well for the dreaded ""wide part"" problem.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing.

Instead there was a long blah-blah-blah description of leaf serum.  You have to purchase the box to see each item and what they do.

It did seem to work on my neck which felt smoother.  I then used the cleanser.  It was crap.  It didn't really clean anything.  I put it on showered and put my nail to my face because it felt like there was a film on it.  Nope, the film was actually my foundation still on my face.  I faired better with the SPF 30 moisturizer.  It was light and went nicely with my foundation.  We did a lot better here.  But...we'll get to that in a minute.  The night cream went on heavier than the Oil of Olay I normally use.  I had to take an extra minute washing my face in the morning.

I am pretty sure that it was listed differently when I ordered. I received the CC cream as pictured. It is definitely a CC Cream/ Sunscreen and not a cleanser.  I am a huge fan of BB creams. However, I have not been able to find a CC cream that I like...until now. CC creams tend to be heavy on sunscreen and with my oily skin that often means breakouts and slick, greasy skin after wearing it for a few hours. I have tried about 8 different CC creams previously and had pretty much determined that I didn't like CC creams. Three things drew me into this La Roche Posay CC Cream to make me try it after so many CC cream fails: 1) the brand name - I have heard great things about La Roche Posay 2) Tone-correcting cream - I have very uneven skin and I am always attracted to tone correcting products 3) redness-prone sensitive skin  - My skin is very red and can be sensitive  When this CC cream arrived, I tried it immediately. It does have a slight sunscreen feel, but it is very, very light. I don't love the initial feel of putting it on my skin, but it is tolerable. What I really love is the great coverage that this CC cream gives you! It definitely evens out my skin tone and redness. It is also comparable to my favorite BB Cream/ Foundation in the amount of coverage. I recommend blending it well with a beauty blender or similar beauty sponge (there are some cheaper ones on Amazon that are comparable). After the cream is blended into my face, it does not feel heavy, sticky or yucky at all. I have been wearing it all day long and it does a decent job of staying put. It also does not make my skin greasy or break out. This is a huge change from all the other CC creams that I have tried!  I personally really love this product and I will continue to use it. I will note that it says to reapply every 2 hours and it is not sufficient enough if you are swimming or sweating. So, like most CC Creams, this can not be used as your sole sunscreen product. However, it is great for your typical everyday wear.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

754,33530,4,False,"08 5, 2018",A1VS1LL905P5L5,B00QPNKVGY,,Hyytekk,"I'm always apprehensive when it comes to using and reviewing an expensive serum or face cream. Why? Because we all have a strange willingness to part with our hard earned money for some small exotic vial of fluid if it purports to make our skin more youthful and radiant. The magic allure seems to rise exponentially the more expensive the product is. I've heard of the Erno Laszio line of products but this was my first opportunity to use a skin emulsion first hand. While not a chemist or scientist, my first response is to consult the ingredients list to try to make some sense of exactly what's in there and the product's strategy to produce it's desired end. Often there's some type of exfoliating acid that's designed to help loosen and gently dislodge the outer layer of dead skin cells and I've had great success with several of those products, though this emulsion seems to use another strategy. With the help of Google, I surveyed the ingredients in this emulsion with some interesting results. There were numerous ingredients whose purpose is to make the product glide on evenly and smoothly as well as fill tiny superficial imperfections with substances such as silicone derivatives. But if my admittedly pedestrian understanding is correct, the two seemingly active ingredients designed to do the heavy lifting are basically rice starch and niacinimide. (Not to ignore the oleanolic acid which is found in olive leaves and supports among other things skin elasticity, but it is listed almost last in the list meaning it is one of the least abundant ingredients in the formulation)  First, do some homework regarding rice water and rice based skin benefits and you might be surprised at the effectiveness of this simple easily purchased and even more easily made at home ingredient. In the past I liked very much Dermalogica's Daily Microfoliant product and a little probing revealed it was largely rice based also. As an alternative, I experimented by purchasing, believe it or not, white rice flour on Amazon. A generous 24 oz size is only 14 dollars. I used it exactly as I used the Dermalogica Microexfoliant and it seemed to produce the same positive results. You use it with water to gently exfoliate and then allow it to dry on your face before rinsing off. It is highly effective in brightening your skin and evening skin tone, though don't expect dramatic results overnight. But with consistent use it is impressively effective. I may have seemed to stray off point, since I can report that using this Lazio Emulsion produced gradual skin tone evening and I noticed a definite improvement as well. Forgive the meandering discussion, but I wanted to give an alternative to purchasing such a spendy product. Rice water or rice flour isn't nearly as sexy as a high end cream, but it seems to get similar results with a basic ingredient.  Niacinamide is also known as vitamin B3. I won't create an unreadably long lecture on that ingredient though I encourage you to do some homework yourself online. It also offers impressive results and should be included in any skin care routine. Interestingly, it is readily available in products costing a relatively meager fifteen to twenty dollars.  My evaluation, therefore, is that this Erno Lazio is an excellent and effective product you should not be disappointed in purchasing and using regularly. There is the matter of it's high cost which for  many might make it a deal breaker. You can have similar results, though, I believe from my personal experimenting and first hand observation, by purchasing a Niacinamide serum and making or purchasing Rice water or even rice flower and using it as a gentle daily exfoliant and mask all at a small fraction of the cost. Conversely, if your budget allows, and your not interested in experimenting, this Erno Lazio Radiende Emulsion offers a simple solution and an effective recommended product.

First we put the polish on her fingernails.  What a disappointment.  There are hardly any glitters or sparkle at all.  What we ended up with is a plain clear base coat that had hardly any sparkles showing.  Too bad, it looked so promising --  Then Paige had the idea to paint her toe nails with a pink polish and try putting the USLU AIRLINES POLISH on top of that -- maybe then the glitters and sparkles would show.  Nope, not even with a pink base coat.  We did apply a second coat and did manage to get a few sparkles on her thumb.  A little while later -- they came off!

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

This gave my face a whitish cast and it ""pilled"" when I tried to rub it in.  That means when I tried to rub this product in, it would actually rub off instead leaving what looks like the residue left over when you use an old fashioned eraser all over my skin.  This residue had to be brushed off which, in turn, tended to create even more residue.  This also left residue and white streaks all around my neck by the end of the day.  I would not purchase this product again.  Update: I ran out of my regular sunscreen and, in a pinch, had to make this one work.  I found that when this product is used alone, as in clean, dry, naked skin without any serums, primers, anti-wrinkle cream, make-up, etc, that it didn't pill and it was much easier to rub in.  Being able to rub it in well also eliminated the whitish cast that it previously left on my skin.  So, if you are at an age where you can get by with just a moisturizer, then this sun screen would be worth a try because, as sun screens go, it's pretty moisturizing.  However, if you need to layer products to address other skin issues then this isn't the sun screen for you.  Maybe someday they will make a moisturizing sun screen like this that does ""play well with other products"" or that is a multi-tasker, eliminating the need to slather on so many products.  Until then,  this is better suited to younger skin.  And, if you need to use acne products you younger folks might run into the same pilling issues when you try and layer the two.

Matlack,"Okay, I'll begin by saying that I actually like this product a lot, but I will add that I have been a fan of mineral makeup for about 8 years now.  The Scott-Vincent compact is sleek and I love the turn dial on this that allows you to grind and mix a fresh batch each time. I also can control the color a little better, I can tap out some of the white and that gives me a little darker color which is perfect as I need a shade between light and medium just to deal with the naturally dark eye circles I was cursed with. It says that it is a cream but it really is powdery, but stays. I'm a fan of mineral make up because yes, it does make your skin look smoother, does not have the heavy and drying feeling of wet foundations. And of course it it SPF 29 (but quite frankly all mineral makeups offer a degree of SPF protection.)  Tho' I have to admit, what really sets this product apart is the exfoliating application brush! What an amazing and beautifully made little brush, this feels like Heaven on my skin. I could just stroke this on my face all day and its like this amazing little message. When I went to Youtube to check out videos on the product (I was hoping to find out about using the mask, I will get to that next.) I found an HSN advert and was a bit dismayed to see the foundation retail for $24.00 dollars (with free shipping) of course halfway thru the video Scott-Vincent intros the Brush and it retailed separately for $25.00 (still not thrilled that Amazon retails this set at $78.00 when HSN sold them for $49.00 - but hey that's why we browse and compare, right?) But I will say that, YES! I would be perfectly happy to pay $25.00 for this Brush alone, it is quite simply the BEST makeup brush I have ever seen/used in my life and it cleans up beautifully. LOVE this Brush.  Now on to the weird part.  Along with the compact and brush came a mask. This is frankly the oddest gimmick I have as yet to encounter with foundation. The instructions included read as follows: ""To prep skin for even quicker skincare benefits, apply mask prior to first use. 1.) Brush white skin care side of foundation treatment on face. 2. Place moistened mask onto face for 5 minutes to enhance nutrient absorption into epidermis. 3. Use both sides of foundation treatment going forward.  Ummm - okay. This is why I went to Youtube and I did not find a video offering instruction on this part of the ""application"". So I winged it by following the above directions. It was odd at best, Since it is only really a one-time use deal there is not a whole lot of purpose for it. Second, maybe if I lived somewhere with some humidity it might not have been a big deal. But I am in Wyoming which is an arid desert state, my skin dried quickly and felt very dry and tight so I washed my face and tried again with my usual three step routine: 1. wash face. 2. apply moisurizer and 3. apply foundation.

While I am aging and as a result, my combination skin of youth was beginning to dry out.

I decided to play it safe and put on the Elemis Biotec Skin Night Cream on only at night. II actually just discovered that moisturizer helps when applying makeup but I didn't want it to be too much that my makeup slid off my face.

The other side which is this thin whitish substance is the part that has the nutrients. Now, I believe that the two pumps you need to administer to your face and neck should mix the products together. However, it doesn't, First, the oily part gets pumped into my palm and then the whitish cream blobs out separately. Not only is this not eye appealing but now I have to blend it so I can properly apply it to my face. I am not sure if the bottle was created poorly that it doesn't mix together or it is intended not to mix but they don't explain anything to the customers. So after you deal with that mess, you apply it all over your face and neck which is easy with the two pumps of cream. It spreads easily and it was absorbed into my skin quickly.

I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.

Because of this, what I can say is whether or not something is irritating to the skin because thats important to know, especially if you have sensitive skin like I do.

At first I tried the product all over and it was so-so, But now If I use the product twice a day on the lines on the limited area over my upper lip it,  it actually helps. (Just remember, before you use this, clean the area by using either a lip sugar glazer and wiping it off or you use whatever else you want to use to make sure the area is very clean and any dead skin sloughed off.)

Mind you, the lines aren't completely gone, but there is an improvement.  On the negative side, if this product is applied too heavily (which isn't hard to do,) you can end up with it peeling/sloughing off - not a good look when you happen to look in the mirror.

Amazon inadvertently sent us the perfume to review instead of the milk, and as my girlfriend (and me) really like the fragrance we decided to keep it.  This product has been a refreshing change. Due to having migraines, asthma, and a VERY sensitive nose, my girlfriend is generally unable to wear most scents. With the BURBERRY Body Tender, Eau de Toilette, however, she found she could apply small amounts of it to places generally not near her face (on the small of her back, I believe), and it didn't cause any reaction.  She's pleased because she LOVES the Burberry fragrance and says it make her feel ""sexy"". I wholeheartedly agree with her assessment!  It has a subtle citrusy, floral scent that smells clean and fresh. Over time it seems to smell more like sandalwood and musk, but never too heavy. The scent lasts much of the day, though she says she will occasionally apply a bit more in the evening if we're going out.  The fragrance comes in an interesting, tall, narrow, octagonal pink/mauve box, and the bottle within is heavy glass in the same narrow octagonal design, with a silver cap. It looks very classy on a dressing table.  Overall a great, high quality fragrance from a premium brand, with the commensurate premium price, which is the only thing I'm critical of.

When it comes to fragrances people either tend to like them or hate them. That's what this fragrance is like. It's a bit strong so if you don't like strong fragrances you're not going to like this. On the other hand, if you like stronger, uplifting fragrances this is perfect. It almost smells as if it has a hint of cinnamon and other spices and an apple undertone. That's just me. Any fragrance you use on your hair or body is going to interact with your own chemistry and you'll either love the smell or hate it. In my opinion, this is a great scent for those frumpy, tired days when you need an uplifting fragrance to enhance your mood and make you smell good. I especially like it after being around someone who has been smoking or other odors that tend to stick to your hair, clothes, and skin. This takes care of the lingering odor right away.

The spatula makes for a more hygienic application since you don't have to dip your fingers into the jar and risk the possibility of introducing bacteria into the cream.  (Of course, Paula Begoun mentions that skin creams and lotions should really be in tubes so that the product ingredients don't oxygenate and lose their potency; the spatula doesn't help avoid that issue, but at least it makes things more sanitary.)

Lately, I've been going with the curlier look because it's getting more difficult to make my hair do what I want.  Enter this Obliphica curl control cream.  I disperse one pump throughout my hair (more on that later), and my hair is much more manageable and style-able.  The style holds throughout the day without any crunchiness or unsightly residue.  And I love the scent.  When I apply, I follow what my stylist does:  squirt a pump into my palm, pick up a bit with the fingertips from the other hand, rub it between them, and then apply by plucking two-thirds of the way up my hair to the ends.  When the cream is almost gone from my palm, I rub my two hands together and use what's on them to finish up.  I don't need to use more than that, although you may, especially if you have tightly curled hair.  I find that this curl control cream is best for, yes, controlling.  If I want to stay curly, it ends up relaxing the curls or weighing them down instead.  That's probably because I have that in-between kind of hair, neither straight nor truly curly.  It keeps the frizz under control, too.

Everything blends so well (I have fair skin that can look clownish easily) and never causes breakouts on my sensitive skin.  This is a GREAT bronzer. When I ordered it, I didn't realize it was really targeted to contouring, but it didn't make a difference. I've now used it as both... a light natural bronzer just dusted on my cheeks and forehead, and for more dramatic contouring.  It comes with three shades of bronzer. The one with the most gold (far left) is the only one with shimmer, in case you are trying to avoid that for daytime or winter use. The bottom stick that looks like an applicator is actually a highlighting stick. It works best on my browbones... the yellow tone doesn't quite match my undertones enough to use it on my nose, even though I'm a neutral.

More importantly for those of us with dry or aging skin, it leaves skin hydrated all day. It left my skin feeling a bit sticky for a couple of hours, so it is absorbed slowly and leaves a protective barrier. After a few days of use, I noticed that my skin seemed plumper and smoother.  The package is a nice heavy glass with a silvery mirrored top. The scent is light and pleasant.

The primary difference between the premium brands and the common ones is generally found in the ingredient list.  If you showed me this Erno Lazlo ingredient list without telling me what the product was, I'd swear that this was Olay.  It contains everything that women are trying to avoid these days:  silicone, petroleum products, and parabens.  That said, those do condition skin, except for those who have developed sensitivity to those ingredients.  In an expensive cream, though, I look for ingredients that are gentler on my skin while still providing moisture and care.  At least the fragrance is not overbearing and is more in line with an expensive product.  Despite my disappointment with the ingredients, this cream does indeed moisturize.  Like most night creams, this one is thick and white.  It goes on smoothly (thanks in part to silicone), and, while it requires a bit more blending than a lighter day cream might, it absorbs fairly quickly.  Use it sparingly -- you don't need a lot.  I love that it comes with a little plastic scoop to keep my fingers out of it.  Even though it is preserved with parabens, you don't want to introduce bacteria that could turn it prematurely.

So far I'm in love.  The brush was a little wet and overloaded with product when I first opened the mascara so I wiped it on a lint-free cloth, as I've done with another mascara and it fixed the problem.  After completely cleaning the brush of the existing product, dipping it back in and starting over I got just the perfect amount of mascara.  I LOVE that sweeping this on my lashes gives them volume and length without being spidery or clumping.  And the ball tip is perfect for getting the small lashes in the inner and outer corners of my eyes as well as going back over anything to make sure every stray millimeter of lash is covered.  I also think it wears well.  I don't notice it flaking or smudging off on my face even though it's quite humid and hot here in Chicago right now and I also commonly wear eye makeup to my hour-long workouts where I am sweating profusely.  It also removes pretty easily with my Sephora brand makeup remover and a cotton round, which is nice because some mascaras can cling on so tight I find myself losing lashes when removing it.

I have tried it on the face for when I'm feeling winter-dry flaky skin and it does work well, but the product is very thick and you'd have to wait some time for it all to sink in before applying makeup. As a night cream? Again might work, but the scent is so strong I wouldn't be able to apply it and stick my head right into a pillow and smelling it all night. Yes, the scent does dissipate, but not immediately.  As a body moisturizer? I liked it a lot, despite the thickness of the cream (apply lightly and then add more if you like). It does help with the winter-dry flakiness, and right after applying I could pour water on my skin and it repelled it - a good thing for those out in the great outdoors. As for the sunscreen aspects?

The ingredients include arbutin, another name for glycosylated hydroquinone, which reduces melanin production, plus alpha hydroxy acids to remove dead skin cells and give skin a fresh appearance.  It slightly improves the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with regular use, but is not noticeably effective in reducing age spots or other areas of increased pigmentation.  A chemical peel can irritate the skin, especially with exposure to solar radiation, but this formula is fairly mild and contains skin conditioners, plus I have not spent much time in the mild winter sun, so I have had no problems using it.

I loved the product itself, but really disliked the color of Cool Beige.  Application: This setting powder comes in a standard 1oz plastic jar. The lid screws off and there are holes to allow you to sift the powder out a bit at a time. It came with a fuzzy applicator puff but I felt like that was wasting a lot of product so I switched to my usual brush. The directions say to apply liberally and buff off after letting it set for 2 minutes. Unfortunately, the Cool Beige tint of the powder really darkened my foundation (currently using Dermablend mousse foundation) in uneven patches so I was unable to use as directed. When applying just a tiny amount with my brush and quickly blending I could minimize the darkening and prevent the splotching effect. I was really surprised that it darkened my foundation as much as it did and in such an uneven way. I have used tinted setting powder before and my skin is not at all pale. For reference, I wear an NC35 in MAC.  Wear: After I got over the quirk of it darkening my foundation, I was pleased with how it extended the wear of my foundation. It gave a nice matte look without looking or feeling dry. My skin stayed fairly oil and smudge free for over 16 hours. I expect the results may have been even more favorable if I was able to apply generously as directed.

In my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. The lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. Most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. Chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.  The directions are simple. Apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. Then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. Make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. Once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.  Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.  I will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and I do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.

It claims to purify skin, soothe skin, eliminate dirt and pollutants, mattify skin, leave skin feeling soft and clean, and reduce pore size with regular use. Vichy also claims that it is safe for sensitive skin. Aloe Vera and Allantoin are the soothing ingredients. I have very sensitive skin with effectively no barrier. Ive had bad reactions to clay masks in the past and have found them too drying, but I gave this one a try, because the ingredients seemed mild, and the instructions said to leave the mask on for only 3-5 minutes. It should not dry on your skin. The clay is fine-textured and gray. It goes on in a thin layer, so a 2.54 oz (75 ml) jar will last a long time. Vichy recommends to use it 1-2 times per week, concentrating on the T-zone area or wherever your pores tend to clog. Rinse off with water.  I started with a small area to make sure I wasn't going to react to the mask. I ended up using it on my whole face. I left the mask on for about 6 minutes, and it was dry in spots. It dries quite quickly. I can confirm Vichys claim that this mask works with sensitive skin. I didn't have any problems with it. I was a little concerned that my skin would react to the fragrance, which I have seen described as a light scent of mint and woody amber. I don't smell the mint, but I would describe the scent as an amber with woody notes. Its musky, and I think there are some florals in there. It does not seem light when the mask is smeared on my face, in close proximity to my nose. I found the scent unpleasant after a while. Its too strong for a mask, and the musky-floral mlange is an odd choice.  I was most interested in the masks pore-clarifying properties. It removed about half of blackheads and performed less well on smaller oil deposits that were not oxidized. I assessed the results in a 10X magnifying mirror, which is scary but essential to see how skin care products are working and to distinguish between a blackhead and a freckle. My Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil does a better job on the oil deposits. A fine-grained scrub removes both blackheads and other oil deposits. The Vichy Pore Purifying Clay Mask did leave my skin feeling smoother than it began, but not as smooth or soft as Im accustomed to when I do a facial treatment. Ive used other mud masks that worked better on blackheads and oil but proved too harsh for my skin. So there is a trade-off. If you have sensitive skin and like masks, this one is probably safe.

Because this is well under the manufacturer's suggested time with the product, this review only covers my first experience with the NuFace itself, not its effectiveness.  PROS  BUILD QUALITY: Other reviewers have complained about the build quality of the NuFACE, but I think it's quite nice and, as a designer, I have a pretty high bar. Granted, it looks a bit like a frog, but overall it's quite nice.  ERGONOMICS: The NuFACE feels good in the hand.  CONS  CHARGING LIGHT: Why oh why do products intended for bedrooms and bathrooms insist on bright, blue lights? Studies show that blue light triggers the brain to wake up. The light the NuFACE emits while charging is bright enough to illuminate my entire (rather large) master bathroom. I really don't need a ""Facial Trainer"" to be the most prominent thing in my bathroom. Nor do I need it to trigger me to wake up every time I make a midnight pitstop. Silly and unnecessary.  UNCOMFORTABLE: This isn't the most comfortable treatment. You'll feel a mild sting throughout the process. And if you have a problem with acne, forget about it. I've noticed that even the slightest facial blemish, scratch, or sunburn is irritated, rather profoundly, but the electrical current given off by the NuFace.

It effectively moves basic daily makeup, finds remnants of lipstick that aren't even very visible, and leaves my face feeling clean and pleasant.  It is great for a quick wipe to remove the oils around my eyes from wearing glasses mid-day that can start to sting my eyes by the evening.  It will take off eye makeup if left to soak for a short time with the cotton pad, but for heavy eye makeup, I think for ease and complete removal, I would still use eye makeup remover and then go over it with this product to clean off THOSE oils.  This product is gentle on the eyes, has no taste on the lips when used for lipstick, has no odor at all - I honestly can't believe this works.. but it does, much more effectively than just water on a cotton pad (I tested that just to make sure I hadn't realized all these years I could accomplish this with just a cotton pad of water...

That's because I cannot replicate it's original fine point. The sharpener that came with it does a poor job -- the usual breaking of the ""lead"" in this pencil, which results in a dollar's worth of loss each time.  Perhaps better attention should have been paid to the selection of wood or better quality control in actually testing the product on the sharpener attached.  It seems that the original manufacturing process produces a point that might not be available to the average consumer.

I can favorably compare this Vincent Longo pencil, however, to the more expensive drug-store options from L'Oreal and Revlon: They are generally half the price but also half the length (or less) and half the quality.

This means you truly can sketch the small lines that emulate eyebrow hairs instead of drawing on a big blob of color.  3. The compound's consistency  means it has staying power. No running or ""migrating.""  It also adds a little body so that you when brush the brow, everything stays where it's supposed to.  4.

As a corrector stick, this works pretty darn well. The color is obviously not as good as an actually color matched concealer, but that's one thing nice about concealer... it doesn't have to be exact because you put it under your final coat of makeup and blend it in.  This dark beige worked just fine on me. I think the lighter one would still be a tad better, but I just ordered it so we will see.  Quality and use is PERFECT.  The stick worked just fine for me, you just take the lid off and twist the base to make it come out. The thickness was PERFECT, and others complaining about the brush are just goofy... it's IDEAL for laying in the concealer in the corner of my eye and under; and I use my fingertips to brush it out and blend it in.

So before I used the NuFACE I spent a few days stepping up my beauty routine.  I masqued, exfoliated, biore-d, derma-rolled, and moisturized my face to get it looking its best.  Then I asked my husband and my daughter to take a good look at my face under bright lights before and after.  NOTE:  The NuFACE facial trainer is not meant to reduce wrinkles so much as it is meant to brighten, tighten, and fill out the face for an overall more youthful appearance.  Though many people have noted a reduction in wrinkles, that is more what the LED attachment (not included) is for.  If you have seen med spa advertisements for a ""lunchtime face lift,"" they are talking about microcurrent facials.  The NuFACE is easy to use.  You just put a thin coat of the gel on your face, power it up, set it to your desired strength 1-5, and you are off.  My skin is not sensitive.  I started out on 3 but bumped it up to a 5 almost immediately.  When I did it near my jawline I had a slight metallic taste in my mouth, and sometimes I could feel the electricity but it wasn't even strong enough to be called a mild shock.  It felt like a gentle,  rapid tapping and was by no means unpleasant or painful in the slightest.  Most of the time I didn't feel anything at all but the smooth metal balls gliding over my skin.  It is easy to get the timing right but no big deal if you don't.  For problem areas you can even hold it on one spot on your face for awhile without moving it.  I did half my face then asked my daughter to compare.  She quickly guessed which side I had done, stating that my skin looked better.  I personally noticed a bit of a brow lift.  When my husband came home that evening I asked him to take another look at my face and he said he could tell a difference as well.  I also took before and after pictures, and can tell a difference.  I have used it for three days now.  It is really easy to work into my routine.  I just wash my face in the morning, do the NuFACE for about 5 minutes, wipe the gel off, and go on about my day.  I decided to do some research on microcurrent as a beauty treatment, and found that it has been around for many years and popular with the Hollywood set.  The level of electricity mimics what is present in the human body anyway, though that decreases with age, so it is completely safe for most of us.  People with pacemakers should not use it, people with thyroid issues should avoid the thyroid area, and everyone should avoid using it on the chest area to avoid getting your heart out of rhythm.  Microcurrent started out as a medical treatment as a pain therapy and also to help people suffering from palsy or stroke to lift their drooping facial muscles back in place.  It stimulates your body to produce more collagen and more amino acids, both which lead to a more youthful and lifted appearance.  If you read unbiased reviews such as by users on YouTube, etc., you will see that pretty much everyone loves it.  The NuFACE is not as strong as the ""lunchtime face lift"" microcurrent treatments advertised by med spas, but that just means it takes longer to see the full effect, not that they are less effective.  And five minutes at home each morning is easier, less time-consuming and less expensive than med spa treatments twice a week for six weeks, which is the recommended start up treatment, with less frequent follow-up treatments thereafter.  NuFACE does not interfere with facial injections such as Botox or Juvederm, though you should not use any microcurrent treatment for about two weeks after having the injections.  After that it is business as usual, and there is some evidence that microcurrent actually makes the injectables last longer and helps to reduce the amount needed.  Yes, the NuFACE is expensive and is not for everyone.  However, if you have been tempted by the ""lunchtime face lifts"" or regularly get med spa treatments, or are just really not pleased with the signs of aging on your face and are willing and able to invest that kind of money, NuFACE is an excellent way to bring back some of the youthful skin tone, fullness and tightness.  It is a hefty initial investment, but check out the unbiased reviews for yourself, do your own research, and figure you can spend that cash now for a piece of equipment you can use quickly and easily in your own home for years, or you can get a handful of spa treatments that will last at the most a few months.",Med spa technology at home,1438300800,271.0,,trainer power even taste bump wash come treatment say wipe figure actually electricity advertise medical injection last nuface get many botox sure read really business tell right cash yes kind shock easy home quickly mimic tap ball bit almost would heart metal amino lift please easily effective juvederm facial overall set two meant without call go alternative time-consuming do note derma-rolled much amount like level suffering could start week handful usual injectables user hold everyone follow-up mouth spend spas palsy problem exfoliate ask money well appearance see pacemaker one personally help compare day acids metallic effect desire lead awhile help time rhythm spend issue etc felt also area anyway see five year human side though take interfere tone use invest chest three noticed picture sign slight mild spot note microcurrent masqued week use bright work longer investment step youthful however lift near half expensive thereafter area stroke tighten enough age take big moisturize gel initial mean muscle less found look daughter face brow reduction back deal place state able good drooping take use talk hollywood sensitive guess slight present sometimes check rapid produce strength start make willing avoid piece best move equipment beauty look body well research time another strong difference look unbiased age med fill painful gliding wrinkle way smooth immediately skin collagen attachment tightness completely six thyroid stimulates jawline recommend therapy brighten minute feel fullness routine pain tempt gentle put safe include need lift morning popular spa twice treatment facial youtube hefty reduce cheap want light full thin frequent month decide love advertisement lunchtime decrease item coat even easy husband lead day biore-d bring review around excellent evidence make people regularly unpleasant get anything pretty

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

Their quality is on the middling side of high-end skin care, which is to say they are good, but IMHO, probably not worth the price they charge.  I have never been so overwhelmed by their products as to purchase them full size, but if I received a sample, I'd probably use it if a favorite moisturizer, serum, or other skin care product was unavailable.  That being said, this mask was one of the more unusual ones I've seen in any line. I'm surprised that no one has thought of it sooner. The delivery system is nifty. A turn of the top and you roll on the proper portion of the gel-like mask to take care of your skin for the evening. It has a strong perfumey scent that I like; be warned if you're allergic to strong scent, this will put you in the ER!  I use Retin A, glycolic acid, and Vitamin C on a daily basis, as well as a Clarisonic, and various scrubs and exfoliators, so my skin is about as good as it gets, product-wise. I'm in the age bracket, though, where I'm always interested in any product that will tighten up my epidermis, so this mask was of particular interest.  I haven't used it quite a month, but so far, I can say I notice a minimal lifting effect. Let's put it this way: it's so minimal, I'm apparently the only one who has noticed it (my husband looked at me as if I had two heads when I asked him if he saw a huge change in my skin.) Now I'm not against a product that only gives a small reward, if it's one YOU notice and works for you. I daresay if you have crepier skin than me, or if you haven't gone whole hog with anti-aging skin care as I have, you might experience a bigger oomph.  I'm going to stick with my Retin A/glycolic acid/Vitamin C regimen, because as far as I'm researched and in my own experience, these are the products that really work.

I haven't used a concealer in a while, but there have been times that I have wished that I had one on hand. I was quite pleased to have the opportunity to try the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Invisible Corrective Concealer Anti-Wrinkle CC Cream.  My first impression on seeing the packaging was, wow! It looked like it contained a jar the size of my Bare Minerals Foundation. That seemed like a lot of product. I soon realized that I was mistaken as the jar takes up only about .75% of the box. The box is made with interior walls that hold the smaller jar in place. It disappoints me when I buy a package that seems to hold a good amount, and find that in fact, there is mostly air or excess packaging. I don't see the point of having the much larger package. The jar is attractive, but the lid is nearly as big as the jar itself, which I also think leads the purchaser to ""see"" a larger amount than is actually provided. This is intentional and very common, no matter what we are purchasing. A lot of time and effort is put forth to make us feel we are getting more than we actually get. The jar is pleasing to look at however, and the lid fits snugly. I keep my cosmetics in a small basket and I have no concern about the lid coming off when this is tossed in with the rest.  The product itself is good in my opinion. When I first touched it, it did feel a little clay like, and was not the soft creamy texture I expected. I used the handle tip of a small brush to take a small amount of the product out of the jar, and placed it on the back of my hand, because I prefer to apply and blend make up with my fingers.

Puret Thermale 3 in 1 Micellar Solution and three .5 oz sample sizes of the Pore Purifying Clay Mask (for purifying), Quenching Mineral Mask (for hydration) and Double Glow Peel Mask (for dullness). I consider my skin dry and sensitive, and I'm really pleased with the Micellar Solution and Clay Mask while the other two masks don't seem well suited for my skin.  The Micellar Solution is wonderful, and I've grown to like it more over time. One of the first things I do when I get home after work is wet a cotton pad or cotton balls with the Micellar Solution and wipe my face. It's a quick and easy way to remove my makeup, cleanse and refresh my skin. The amount of makeup and grime left on the cotton pad is astonishing. This product feels gentle and contains no soap, colorants, oil or alcohol. It does list fragrance as an ingredient, but I really can't smell it. This is a great product.  I've tried all three masks. I'm impressed with how the Clay Mask makes my face feel. I apply a thin layer and rinse just before it's dry. My skin seems to soak the moisture right out of this mask for some reason, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, fresh and extra clean. It also seems to soften white gunk in my clogged pores by my nose, though it doesn't remove it. But I then focus on those pores with my Clarisonic and the mask seems to help get rid of the gunk. I'm very pleased with the Clay Mask.  The Quenching Mineral Mask makes my skin itch, so I haven't continued to use it. Denatured alcohol is a main ingredient, and I'm guessing but I don't think it agrees with my dry skin. It just doesn't feel good to me, even though it should given that it's for hydration. The Double Glow Peel Mask is an AHA face scrub that should gently exfoliate. But it makes my sensitive skin feel like it's burning, and I need to rinse it off.

I am a bit surprised to find that this hair gel has received so many negative reviews - overwhelmingly 1 or 2-star reviews (as of the writing of this review). That has not been my experience using this product for a few days, however, I do not have the history with Jack Black Hair Gel that some other reviewers do.  My ""go-to"" hair styling product for the last several years has been American Crew Forming Cream. That product strikes a good compromise between styling hold and control and avoids hard, stiff hair a.k.a. helmet head. It is, however, a bit pricey so I am always on the lookout for other products with similar performance at a cheaper price. I think Jack Black Building Hair Gel is that product even if the savings are marginal.  I've worn this product two days; both days work days where I keep my hair neat and tidy. The product has performed great! The gel is clear, definitely fruity smelling (no surprise there), and holds my hair while not giving me hard, stiff hair. The Jack Black definitely is stiffer than my American Crew forming cream but nothing like the cheap drugstore gel of my youth. Honestly any stiffer and you might as well buy a tub-o-gel (in neon blue) from the drugstore.  I found that styling my (short) hair was as easy as the forming cream I use. The Jack Black product held my hair throughout the day without issue. So for me this is definitely a product that I would purchase and use again.

The cons:This is very chalky and much lighter than I expected. Also, and this is the biggest drawback, it doesn't cover that well.

It is creamy, applies evenly, blends well, and dries fairly quickly. It contains a moderate amount of pigment and is more translucent than opaque.

It makes me sad to see adults with terrible acne scarring that could have been avoided. As far as I can determine eating things like greasy food or chocolate causing acne is a myth.  First I should remind you this device is not for scarring, wrinkles, dark spots, rosacea, cystic acne or anything else except inflammatory acne. Of course don't use on moles, cold sores etc. If you're on a prescription consult your dermatologist. If you have dark skin start using the ""blue' more slowly.  They think that maybe darker skin types are more sensitive to the infrared heat in the device, and maybe they should get used to the device more gradually. They don't say so but I would think this would be a reason to avoid using on tattoos.  You should have some kind of timing device (an hour-glass egg timer works well) to tell you when to move the device to another area. Wouldn't it be nice if they could put a time reminder on it like they do electric toothbrushes? But the most important thing you will need is patience and determination.  You have to hold the device on each area for three or four minutes twice a day.  You won't believe how long three minutes really is. If you're listening to music it's about the length of one song (unless it's ""stairway to heaven"" of course)  Be sure to completely charge the unit the first time before you use it.  Be sure your skin is completely clean and dry before you start. They say it will take from three to seven weeks for the ""Blue"" to work but I think there is a visible improvement in as little as a week.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing.

Let's see how this measures up.  WHAT IS THIS LIKE? This salt scrub is made with fine himalayan salt.  It comes in a red plastic jar and is sealed.  It has some oil in it, but mostly salt, so it is not over-oily.  The smell is delicious.  Although it has some artificial fragrance, it does not gag me or make me prefer a natural one instead.  HOW DOES THIS PERFORM? When using this in the shower with dampened skin, I found that I only need a teaspoon for my arms and a little more than that for each leg.  The salt is very fine and it does scrub well.  It is not overly oily, but it does seal the skin nicely, creating a moisturizing effect.  The fragrance is very lovely.  It stays on long enough to make me feel special, but is not so strong that people recoil when they encounter me after a shower.  ANY BAD REACTIONS? There have been no bad reactions to this at all.  MOISTURIZING? The moisturizing lasts for me all day and into the next day although it is summer and I don't have as hard of a time as winter for dryness.  THE BOTTOM LINE For a beautifully fragrant experience that feels royal and naturally but gently exfoliates the skin, this scrub is really lovely.

1742,23310,3,True,"11 19, 2016",A2IDRAYYZ5GKBZ,B00ET3D5VK,{'Size:': ' 1.7 oz.'}, Catrinka ,"Frankly, after reading some of the reviews and shelling out $110 for this L'Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream, I expected it to be wonderful and that I'd absolutely love it.  That wasn't my experience, though.  For starters, the HEAVILY perfumed scent was very unappealing to me with my first use.  I don't insist on only unscented facial creams and usually expect at least some underlying scent in most beauty products that I buy.  However, this is by no means an ""underlying"" scent with the Immortelle Divine Cream.  Instead, the strong perfume hits you as soon as you remove the lid.  Fortunately, the heavy scent doesn't seem to last more than a few minutes after applying it to my face.  Or at least I didn't notice the strong smell after a few minutes.  My skin can sometimes react negatively to heavily fragranced skincare products, but I experienced no breakouts with the Immortelle Divine Cream.  As far as the anti-aging benefits, I haven't noticed any difference in three months of use.  In fairness, I always use high quality facial creams and serums, so it's unlikely to register the same improvement in a situation like that as opposed to someone who uses few, if any, high-end beauty products.  My skin texture neither improved nor worsened, although I did notice that my skin wasn't quite as dewy or glowing with this cream as it is with some other night creams.  What I DO like about it?  It seems to last a bit longer than similarly sized jars of other creams.  I think this is because a smaller amount seems to go further when smoothing onto your face.  It has a bit of an oily texture going on, so my face would be a greasy mess if I used the amount I'd normally use.  The result is that a little 1.7 oz jar is lasting longer than usual.  This would be great if it happened to be a night cream that I loved.  This L'Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream works best used only as a night cream.  For several hours, my skin is left with a greasiness from it that doesn't work with any daytime makeup application.  It's fine for daytime when I'm going without makeup, but most days I apply at least a light dusting of bareMinerals powder.  The powder just thickly gums up on my skin when I tried to apply it over this cream, even if I wait for a half hour or so.  And liquid foundation just sort of disappears and doesn't adhere to my skin.  I'm always concerned about high-end beauty products possibly being counterfeit and I specifically avoid buying them if they're far below the normal purchase price or have slight differences in packaging.  My little jar arrived in original box with all of the safety seals, including the pretty embossed gold foil inner seal.  The expiration date on mine wasn't great -- due to expire 2-3 months after my date of receipt.  I'd actually intended to send it back for a refund after I noticed that, but time got away from me and by the time I went to do it, it was after Amazon's 30-day return policy.  Bottom line, this cream does as well as any of my other favorite night creams in the $50-80 range.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.

At first I didn't like it very much and had not bought bar soap for many years using only liquid soap for face, hands and body. I have tried this and a few others that are similar in price (or even more expensive) and it's growing on me now. The reviews of this soap are basically good and I can see now why they are. My skin has not been dry after using this and I did test it by not using any lotion on my body which I normally do every night after a shower. I also used it to hand wash some underwear and it was quite good. The lavender fragrance is not too strong for those who want to have the smell linger afterwards. As I said in my first review this bar is rather large and a bit awkward at first. I found it slipping out of my hands but am using a washcloth now to prevent this from happening. I did want to revise my first negative review for people like myself who do read them before buying something they're not familiar with online! The original version was: This is the first soap bar that I have purchased in many years - I use bath and shower gel and liquid face soap. I thought I would try something different and since this had many good reviews and I like the smell of lavender I bought it. I recently noticed that my skin was looking 'thin' and I attributed this to the many showers using a washcloth on my skin with the liquid soap. My skin is normally dry (bar soap has always been drying to me and I do apply moisturizer after every shower) and this one didn't feel dry right after using it which I did like. The bar is large and should last a long time but it does get slippery when it gets wet and slides off the built in soap bar in the shower and it's somewhat awkward to hold on to. The lavender smell is not so strong and it really doesn't have any scent unless you put your nose on top of the bar before it gets wet. As for the price of this soap I think it's a little too high and possibly because of the name L'Occitane and the fact that it's made in France the way it is described.  I'm not sorry I bought this and will use it eventually, perhaps for some hand washing of delicates.

My sense is that it is at its best doing what I term as ""maintenance shaves"". That is, one or two passes in order to get to an acceptable level of closeness. On very thorough shaves, it can become a bit aggressive. Every time I've done a third facial pass, I have found that I regretted it afterward. Not because I have actually cut myself, but because I have felt that I've put more wear and tear on my face than was warranted.  My experience indicates that a moderate blade works best here, one that splits the difference between smoothness and sharpness. My go-to for the 39C is the Personna Lab Blue. The Wilkinson Sword worked great for the first pass, but was really prone to getting a bit too aggressive on subsequent passes. Of course, your results may vary.  What this razor excels at is the first pass. None of my other DE razors take as much hair off, as easily, as the 39C. If your preference is to simply do a quick shave every day, and you're not looking for a baby smooth result. This is your machine. I wouldn't recommend it as a first DE razor, but that' simply because a slant head is always going to take a more gentle hand, and it could really cut you up if you couldn't find the angle.

On a related (downside) note, the packaging is this tiny pump that only pumps out a little at a time.  To get the necessary coverage on my face -- because sunscreen is not the thing you want to skimp on - I need to pump this sucker a good 8-9 times.

While their products may not fit my skin type completely, I'm glad that their high quality ingredients ensures that they won't do too much harm, either.  I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but unfortunately it feels just too thick and pasty for my taste. It comes in a nice frosted glass jar and has a consistency not unlike sour cream. Because it feels so thick, I used it sparingly on my face and neck. Fortunately, my skin absorbed it quickly and it doesn't leave too much of a residue. The fragrance is so mild as to be almost not there, which I don't mind (I shy away from anything too strong-smelling).  It's OK but I have many different types of moisturizer and nothing about this one stood out. Yes, my skin was a little softer, but no better or worse than other products I've used, like Neutrogena, Aveda, Burt's Bees and L'Occitane.  I think this product would be best for those who are have highly sensitive skin and break out often to the use of artificial ingredients.  The price is a little high, and given its OK but not outstanding performance, I'll stick to my current AHAVA Dead Sea moisturizer.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

I buy high-quality brushes as a rule, but I love this brush even more than my normal one and will be using it from now on.  I am surprised that this foundation is described as a cream, as it looks and applies like a powder.  I tried it on bare skin, on half my face.  My teenaged daughter immediately pointed to that side of my face and said, ""That side looks better.  And younger.""  I was surprised at the younger comment.  Then she asked if that was the side that has the makeup on.  It is that light, that you can hardly tell that you are wearing it other than that you look better.

I have used the Vincent Longo Blonde Micro Pencil for several weeks now and I have to say that it does not wear well.  The pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.  The color is nice- very close to MAC Lingering or Tarte Taupe brow pencils in color.  The pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  The sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  I don't like that feature.  What I have found with this pencil is that despite it looking very close in color to the other two which I have previously mentioned, it does not wear as well.  I have done one brow with this pencil and a different one on the other.  At the end of the day, the other brand is still good, but the Vincent Longo pencil is smeary, spotty, and seems to have settled into my pores a bit too.  I do not have oily skin.  For the price, I don't think that this brow pencil works for me anyway.  Nice color, but very disappointing wear time.  I don't want to have to try that hard with any brow products.

Even at luxury price points, many items are purely functional and one can't wait to stash them away in a drawer to eliminate visual clutter in a bathroom or dressing area. This little beauty of a beauty tool, however, you'll wanna leave out. It's just that nice looking, and shouldn't tools we use to enhance our appearance inspire that goal? Aside from its good looks, it's very ergonomically designed. It has a comfortable balance in the hand, the lever has a perfectly tuned resistance, and there's nothing your hair can catch on during use. This makes curling your hair a very slick and sleek operation. It's simply a pleasure to use.  According the manual, there are five additional barrels available to interchange with the convertible base . They are: a 1.25-75"" tapered barrel, a 1"" straight barrel, a 1.5"" straight barrel, a 1"" straight barrel with clip, and a 1.25"" straight barrel with clip. That's quite a long list, and helps justify the lofty price point, especially if you like variety in your styling habits. I, however, don't curl my hair on a daily basis and that's why I removed one star from the review. I think there are less expensive and functional options available for folks who don't require an iron day after day.  This iron heats up impeccably fast. It reached its hottest setting in under 30 seconds! I have very thick hair, so I had to use very small portions of hair on each go. The result, however, were very soft, shiny and sleek curls like nothing I've ever previously experienced.  This is just a gorgeous, high quality curling iron that's just a pleasure to use.

Although it comes out looking 'white,' (it's the sunscreen), it didn't seem to have color on my face. It has SPF 15 sunscreen.  Why doesn't every foundation and primer have sunscreen?  This is perfect for wear to and from the office. I am 54 and have oily skin.  Even on a humid Iowa day, at the end of the day, after using this product, I still had a relatively matte finish rather than a big oil slick, and my foundation was still in place, i.e. it hadn't slid off the way it usually does.  Things that gave me pause about this product --  It took me a while to figure out how to get it open.  I know, how hard can it be, right?  The chrome lid is a pull-off, not a twist off.  THEN, the semi-conical ""spout"" does twist 180 degrees from ""off"" to ""on""  So, two steps, which is kinda weird.  The reason I can't love this product --  I have oily, blemish-prone skin.  I'd gone 4 weeks without a breakout but by the end of the first day with this primer, I had three new blemishes.  To be totally fair, I have NEVER found ANY primer that doesn't make me breakout.  It's not an irritation at all, just blemishes.  So if you don't have blemish-prone skin and have used other primers successfully, I would recommend this one, because I really did like the feel, the performance and the sunscreen.

First, the both of the colors are really quite orange, so unless your skin is on the Oompa Loompa spectrum, it might not be great. But, and this sort of contradicts what is says about ""medium to full coverage"", it is relatively sheer, so when you put it on, it looks like a light spray tan (yes, the orange kind, but not in a terrible way, just in a kind of unnatural way).  If you are in the heat or sweating, you can also expect it to look patchy if used alone. Some parts will look shiny, some won't. Some will keep the color, some will kind of soak into your pores, making your face feel like it's suffocating a little. I was outdoors for not very long but in Florida heat, and it should have done better for fewer than 10 minutes.

It's great because unlike many cleansing creams and soaps, you don't have to put it on with a pad or sponge; just use your fingers and add water.  So it really does work well as a cleanser and also it is a makeup remover. It's also advertised to work as a toner as well. In fact, they recommend leaving it on your face for 5 minutes before you wash it off.  The first time I did that, the next morning I found that bits of the skin on my face sloughed off - but not in a severe way like it did when I tried using a retinol cream. Instead this sloughing was barely noticible (more I could feel it) and I just rinsed my face and it felt so much cleaner and softer. Loved it.  I have tried and used many facial cleaners and aging creams from cheaply priced to very expensive, and have to say this is my favorite cleanser. It is on the expensive side, but you really don't need to use very much - just that pea-sized drop.

The best skin creams can only keep the skin plumped and hydrated enough that wrinkles are smoothed and seem to disappear or at least be less noticeable. But I believe that by keeping the skin moist we can at least delay the appearance of some of the new wrinkles.  One of the biggest reasons I like this cream is that it makes my skin feel good. When my face feels dry, right after a shower, or outdoors on a cold or windy day, it makes me feel out of sorts and uncomfortable.

During the past year, my skin has become dry, irritated and red.  To my chagrin, I had to stop using an electric shaver; this helped but I still had some patches of dry skin in areas where I didn't shave, primarily around my left eyebrow.  In order to relieve the situation, I had to shave every other day and only wash my face in the morning and never at night.  Every morning, I used an exfoliator that was designed to be gentle (NIVEA Men Sensitive Face Wash).  Still, I had to use a lot of Cetaphil in order to relieve my dry skin.    When the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Mario Badescu Seaweed Cleansing Soap, I jumped at the opportunity to try it.  It has noticeably improved the feel and texture of my skin.  I have returned to shaving every day and to washing my face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night before going to bed.  In fact, I feel confident that I could wash it more often as needed.  I squeeze a tiny smear of the greenish, speckled cream onto the palm of my left hand and use my right fingers to smear it onto my face.  I gently rub it into my skin.  The seaweed cleansing soap has a pleasant smell that is barely noticeable.  It is not strong and abrasive like liquid aftershave.    The soap is easily washed off.  It does not sting my flesh like some exfoliators have done.  My skin is left feeling moist, not dry and irritated.  According to the packaging, this soap is designed for ALL skin types.  The plastic bottles appearance is neither feminine nor masculine.  It is what I call gender friendly.  However, there wasn't any safety seal beneath the old-fashioned screw on cap.  It is difficult to rub a small amount into the palm of my hand.  It would have been better if the cap had a spout that lies flat with the top of the bottle.  You lift up the spout and squeeze out a small dollop of the cream.    Overall, I really like the seaweed cleansing soap from Mario Badescu Skincare.  It thoroughly cleans my skin, giving it a healthy glow, without dehydrating it.  I relish the creamy texture, color and scent of the cleanser.  It easily washes off my face.  The bottle is small enough to carry in a backpack, purse, shoulder bag, tote bag, etc.  Therefore, it is conducive for traveling.  After using the product for nearly a week, I haven't experienced any adverse side effects.  I highly recommend this seaweed cleansing soap.

2320,19006,5,False,"05 29, 2015",ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,B006HMAT9C,,Terry R. Nye,"For many years I have been in search of a quality, compact grooming kit.  Over the years I have had kits given to me as gifts, and have purchased kits myself, but all have been the typical Chinese junk one finds at the local discount stores.  For a long time I have had to settle for nice nail clippers made in Japan, which I really like, but I have still lacked the nice matched set I've wanted.  So when I received the opportunity to review the Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set I got very excited.  The set arrived in today's mail and was perfect timing as my nails have very much been in need of a trim, and I have been waiting for the set to arrive.  First off, this is not just over-priced junk.  This is a very precision-engineered grooming set manufactured by the same company known for its premium chef knives.  This grooming set falls in that same category of quality craftsmanship where you get what you pay for.  So before fainting at the price keep in mind you are paying for very high quality.  The set arrives in a nice box for gifting, and the grooming tools are neatly arranged in a stylish, thick leather case with a zipper closure.  There are only 5 tools in the set, but the case is overly large and has extra slots in it that lead me to believe it was designed to hold additional tools (a comb and/or razor, perhaps?).  Each tool has its own slot with the longer file and cuticle pusher needing to be kept at the edges of the case or it won't close.  The case is a bit bulky for this grooming set, but the leather is very nice and no doubt contributes to some of the high cost of this set.  The nail clippers are very unique and frustrated me at first.  Unlike other clippers, these are designed to fold completely flat for storage and arrive that way.  To open them you must gently pull back on the top half of the clipper (there is a small ribbed area on it to give you a surface to pull it backward with) which allows the two pieces to separate a little bit.  This is where I got initially frustrated as the tool will not clip or work properly without taking the additional step of lifting the back end of the upper clipper upward and then pushing it forward to lock it into a clipping position.  I don't know if the one I received had a stuck spring or if I just didn't use it correctly at first, but once I figured it out I had no problems using the clipper.  The manufacturer really should provide a little instruction sheet with this set as I have no doubt many have been frustrated thinking the clipper was useless from not knowing how to open it correctly.  The clippers are so lightweight and frail-feeling that I was afraid they might break easily, but I quickly found that very little force is needed for them to precisely cut my nails.  And when I say cut, I mean cut.  These have very precise and sharp edges that cut the nail off with absolutely no jagged edges or tearing like ordinary clippers.  Even the fine Japanese nail clippers I own do not cut this easily and precisely.  After clipping my nails I found little need for usage of the nail file, although the file in this kit is equally nice and works great.  The scissors in this kit are also remarkable in their precision and sharpness.  The rounded tip makes them very safe for trimming eyebrows, nose hairs, and hair that always seems to grow out of men's ears as we get older.  There is nothing particularly special about the cuticle pusher/nail cleaner or tweezers.  They have the same look and feel as the other tools in the set, but for my purposes won't see that much use.  In a perfect world, for the cost involved, it seems like a small stainless steel comb should have been included in this set.  Overall, this is a very fine grooming set.  I would say this is what I have had in mind in my years of searching for a quality groomng set.  The cost of this set will not be appealing or likely appropriate for many men, but for the man who appreciates quality and wants a nice grooming set to stay well-groomed this Zwilling J.A.

I am picky about my products because I believe shaving is an art. I did not expect to be overly impressed with L'Occitane CADE Shaving Cream but I was. If you are just a squirt from the can kind of guy this may not be for you. There is no doubt that you can rub in in your hands and apply it to your face and get a decent shave, but this cream works best for me when applied directly to my shaving brush after it has been moistened with hot water (before applying the Cream to the moistened brush shake the brush once to eliminate excess water saturation). The amount of Cream squeezed from the tube to the shaving brush should be no more than the length of toothpaste you would squeeze onto your toothbrush. There is no need to spread this Cream on your shaving brush. Instead, working the brush starting on either side of the face using a circular wrist action will begin to work up this cream into a lather as you work he brush on your face. Once you have covered your face by circular motions, use a back and forth motion with your brush to make a consistent, smooth creamy layer on your face.

The smell is nice, and I find it to be more masculine than other reviews have indicated.

The colors are white with copper-ish colored trim.  I expect the copper color to definitely wear off with frequent use, but for starts it's the loveliest curling iron I've ever seen.  And I guess it should be for $185.00.  I have several curling irons and brushes stuffed under my bathroom sink right now and none of them compare to this one.  The clip that holds hair against the heated barrel is strong and the clip must be opened to release hair once it's been curled.  You will not be able to easily pull it out without losing some hair so be sure to open it again.  The various 5 heat settings are really nice to have and are very easy to set.  I don't like it very hot but my daughter has very tough hair and needs to use the highest heat setting.  The T3 Micro Twirl Convertible Curling Iron comes (I believe because it's not quite super clear) with a straight 1.25 barrel but you can purchase different sizes of barrels.  It heats up fast and they include a black pad to rest the hot barrel on when you lay it down on your bathroom countertop.  I think that was a very nice extra since it could possibly damage it if it was really hot.  The tip of the barrel does not heat up so you can hold it with your bare fingers if you need too.  Still be careful though, because you have less than an inch of ""cool tip"" to hold onto.  The cord is nice an long and should give you plenty of room to work especially if you only have one electrical outlet and have to share the counter space with someone.  And the cord swivels from the end so getting your cord all curled up shouldn't be a problem.  It also has a 1-hour automatic shut off (which I admit, I haven't tested yet).  It's got a nice weight too.  It might get your arm tired for a while until you get used to it.

When using soap first on smells that are new on the skin and then using the stainless steel bar on the hands for 40-45 seconds under running water, 90-100% of odors are removed from the hands.  When the odors are older and have been on the skin for a while (such as cutting onions for a giant pot of French Onion Soup, or tons of garlic for garlic laden dishes), with or without soap, about 80% or more of the odors are removed.  That is still quite significant.  I have never had a big problem with fish smells on my hands.  In the autumn when we get local onions, that will be another time to test because they are the most powerful in terms of removing from skin that I have encountered EVER. No other onions the rest of the year compare to the local onions that time of year. I will update if there is more to report there. If this removes most of THAT odor, I will be thrilled.  URINE ODORS We have male rabbits and a cat.  This can make for a huge odor problem with things you have to wash or encounter in cleaning up.  I have found that using this bar as recommended after soap, almost all of the odor is gone consistently.  I would imagine this would also be applicable to mothers who have to contend with diapers and other baby messes involving organic origins.  BODY ODOR When using this in the shower, you can apply it to the under arms using the same principle (a bit tricky to keep water flowing on the area constantly compared to hands) I do find that it really does cut down on body odor more than not using it.  This would be a great idea to keep one in the shower for any family members who have a bit harder time with strong body odor.  SMELLY FEET I have not had the opportunity to use it yet as no one has had the problem recently.  I will update when I do.  UNMENTIONABLE ODOR Used once in a difficult situation during an illness that affected odor, it did help a lot.  This would be another reason to keep one in the shower for someone who has a difficulty in this area.  It is not chemical or harmful to the body and does help remedy the situation greatly.  THE BOTTOM LINE This stainless steel bar is not only great for reducing or eliminating kitchen odors, but also for pet urine, diaper smell, body odors of various kinds, and perhaps even more that I have not discovered as of yet.  The bar is designed to be a bit rougher in texture so that it will help more effectively get the odors off of the skin and keep it from slipping out of the hands when wet.  It is easy to hold and well designed.",Great To Have Around For A Multitude of Uses In Addition To Kitchen,1418774400,,,fall local diaper texture member fill baby hand use brief quite find cook soup wash nicely smooth wet like order ever host shower hour flow chemical surface cut contend powerful smell origins skin significant heard someone shoe opportunity dishwashing cat time hold area laden tall onion soap get encountered shape ton big problem recommend hard great test diaper bar hand scrub feel steel preserve soap principle unmentionable involve source mess shower find huge line food remedy thing really smell french affect one point despite agitation origin lot new term go urine discover arm whole removing tray compare cut deduction far matte foot compare reason synthetic sound good harmful use day consistently male kitchen list first illness update bit skill variety almost help time organic odor remove perhaps stainless difficulty would various imagine dish everything test also mother rougher area still situation kind arm onion even water autumn leave clean giant smelly rest report bottom applicable easy drop recently difficult reduce second side make tricky idea never design pet rabbit encounter run constantly recess two last yet try without run eliminate slip oval body thrill allows greatly use year well tell strong effectively remove another apply old odor family fish pot garlic abrasion keep

Strivectin is a well-known name in skin products, since its beginnings as a company that just produced a skin cream to reduce stretch marks.  Now they have branched out into any number of skincare products.  According to its description, this Advanced Retinol Eye Cream has been proven to (1) deliver benefits of retinol without skin irritation, (2) minimize fine lines and crow's feet, (3) firm and fortify the eye area, (4) nourish and hydrate, and (5) smooth and refine texture.  To make this sound even better, it has a patented NIA-114 technology to do all this.  (Yeah, I don't know what that is either.)  However, a reading of the list of ingredients, of which there are more than 50, does not inspire a lot of confidence that this is truly revolutionary.  Other than the retinol, it looks like the usual ingredients for skin creams, some of them perfectly innocuous, some of them slightly iffy.  But how does it work?  Does this grandmother have minimized fine lines, smoother and more refined skin texture, less visible signs of aging around the eyes?  Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't notice that this works any better than many less expensive eye products I've used in the past.  And, even though I only use a very small amount under each eye (maybe a dab the size of a sesame seed), it takes quite a while to be absorbed.  It feels somewhat greasy and looks somewhat shiny, and, if I put on mascara, there is sometimes smearing when the eyelashes touch the moisturized skin under my eyes.  After I have used up this sample, I won't be purchasing it again.  Considering its high price, I don't consider it effective enough.  What I really need is to get enough sleep.  That's what makes these old eyes of mine look better.

Vichy (which is owned by LOral) claims that Rhamnose has anti-inflammatory and skin soothing properties. This is based on a small sample clinical trial that was funded by Vichy. Whether Vichys claim on the efficacy of Rhamnose is accurate or not is anyones guess. Lets say that it may be effective. It will take about a month to see if there are any real effects.  This serum is a light milky looking liquid that has a floral fragrance. It spreads easily over the face and neck and is absorbed quickly. I do not find the fragrance objectionable. If you are sensitive to fragrance, you may dislike this one.  It is dispensed from an eye dropper attached to the products cap. Prior to unscrewing the cap, press down once on the button at the top of the cap. This fills up the eyedropper with the appropriate amount of serum. Unscrew the cap and holding the dropper over an open hand press the button and the serum is released. I find that a single dose is plenty to spread over my face and neck.  I use this serum in the morning prior to applying moisturizer. So far, I have found it pleasant and easy to tolerate. My skin is soft and smooth and because of this, signs of ageing are diminished. I use a prescription generic Tretinoin Cream, .025% at night and so do not apply this serum at night, only in the morning.",Anti-Aging Serum and Not a Moisturizer!,1460592000,4.0,,sign product heavier strengthen month hand liftactive use sample find component amount acid button dislike smooth screen skin efficacy skin loral guess spread open night serum plant soft claim anti-inflammatory topically dose funded claim press clinical take effect benefit protective cream real contains dispense find naturally buckthorn anyones unscrew one miss replace face appropriate fill morning underneath reduce generic vichy apply age far hold own tretinoin single twice use quickly tolerate rhamnose accurate major whether light cream sensitive pleasant absorb neck intend let barrier particular top augment moisture sun occur provide see moisturizer plenty easy easily liquid effective day cap property diminish prescription release moisturizers unscrew vichy milky prior eyedropper objectionable fragrance floral attach bind dropper eye spread anti-aging sugar base say soothe apply may look trial healthy small hyaluronic

According to AHAVA, ingredients include Dead Sea Osmotor, a patented combination of Dead Sea minerals contained in all AHAVA products, known to improve skins moisture and youthfulness.

A lot of makeup artists say that a shimmery bronzer is great on people with deep skin tones.  My skin tone is light-medium.  The Balm seemed like a good one to try based on some YouTube reviews I watched.  I am absolutely pleased with it.  It's 100% matte, has a soft and creamy natural texture.  It is a powder but it really melts into my liquid and cream foundations beautifully.  It has good pigmentation, and a little bit of product goes a long way.  This makes it easier to work with since you don't have to keep layering it.  I find that products that aren't pigmented enough require a lot of layering which makes the product look caked on.  It is VERY easy to blend.  I love the shade most of all. It isn't too warm or cool.  It isn't ashy.  It's the perfect color for warming up your face.

This primer by Japonesque is mostly an illuminating base that can be worn under foundation or can also stand on it's own as a product that brings out a healthy glow. That said, it's really only going to give a healthy glow for those with fair skin. Those with darker skin I think may find that this is really best only used under other makeup, as a primer. It has a lightening effect, which I really like since I'm fair skinned, but others won't.  It smooths on nicely, and the bottle is a decently large size considering that a little goes a long way with this product. It has a shimmery look which can help make dry skin like mine look fresh and dewy. On the other hand, I'm not sure this is my favorite primer. While it's a nice fresh, illuminating base, it doesn't have that silicone feel my other primers have had. I've also noticed this product doesn't make makeup stay put the way my other primers have.

The Eau De Toilette is not as strong as a perfume, and takes a bit more but is potent and lasting. 1-2 sprays provides a great scent profile for most people.

This is a woody, green, herbal fragrance that is manly and fresh without being overtly sexy. In the initial spray, basil leads but quickly fades back to being an almost undetectable middle tone that says ""herbal"" really more than ""Basil"". After the dry down, which does not take long, the mandarin is an invigorating top note, while lavender lies just underneath. The base notes of sandalwood with just a tad of vetiver give it a woodsy, earthy fragrance and deep masculinity. Its probably got other notes, these are just the ones that I can distinctly detect. Also, note that in some people, after the dry down, the notes can vary in their lead, so it might seem more floral and sweet on some, if the lavender leads the fragrance on them.

After a one-minute ""application"" with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.

The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a ""cool"" factor to it.  - There's a one minute timer that has what I call a ""tripacer"" (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.  - None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.  - The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.  - This can be used to remove cosmetics.  - The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.  CONS:  - Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.  - There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.  - If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.  - The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing.

To test just how 'unisex' it is, I conducted a mini experiment where I asked friends to smell a sample and try to determine if it was a 'male' or 'female'. The results were expectedly mixed, with some leaning towards male and some leaning towards female. No one was especially passionate about one side or the other and when they discovered it was a 'unisex' scent there wasn't much surprise. Personally, I think it is more feminine than masculine.  What leaves me underwhelmed is how un-signature this fragrance is. Call me cheesy, but I like to select unusual colognes and even mix together favorites. I also want a fragrance that conveys images of mystery and intrigue, or at least convey SOMETHING. It doesn't have to be ultra masculine, in fact I've even mixed in some of the less sweet perfumes before. I think this fragrance is just kinda bland. By aiming to be neither male or female, it ends up being nothing. Like a clothing store where too much perfume and cologne have been sampled and they mix together into a bland mix of nauseous.  It does make me a little nauseous, too. A small spray goes a LONG way and too much is not flattering. I find myself almost being scared to use it because I'm afraid it'll end up being too much.  OVERALL: Not bad smelling, but it is strong and it doesn't have a lot of personality. Use in moderation and you'll smell nice, but I doubt you'll get any complements.

The main active ingredient, supplamine, is a combination of two aminos that work together to  treat glycation.  Glycation is a major cause of skin aging, and is cause by sugars attaching to collagen and elastic, creating inflammation and less resilient skin.  Supplamine not only prevents the toxic sugars from being made, but it also works to neutralize existing toxic sugars.  So now with that background information out of the way, I can share how my experience with it has been.  I have rather sensitive skin, and many anti-aging products have caused irritation and stinging when I apply it.  This serum hasn't caused any problems for me in terms of discomfort or irritation.  The product information says it takes at least 28 days for full effects to be seen, so I will have to update this review after a few weeks use in order to evaluate that claim.  However it does leave my skin feeling well hydrated and is not sticky or unpleasant feeling.  This is only 1 ounce of product, so at close to $100, is rather expensive.

Part of why I like to mix my scents is because I'm rarely 100% satisfied. Perfume these days tend to be either too sugary and sweet or too old-fashioned and flowery. Adding a musky cologne can tone down an overbearing perfume and, alternatively, a hint of sweet perfume can make a cologne less intimidating.  The reason that I have chosen to give 'Sensuelle' 5 stars is because I feel like it is pretty much perfect as is. There is a brooding darkness that lingers just underneath the floral overtones that is the perfect combination of naughty and nice. I like that they describe the blackcurrant as 'tart' because there are some notes of bitter grapes. The floral aspects are indeed sensual, but in a youthful modern way. It's very much a strong, powerful businesswoman fragrance. It's not something I would wear to the club. It smells too important for leisure and frivolities.  My only warning is that you should not overuse this fragrance. A little goes a LONG way. Too much will have a dizzying effect that will be counterproductive to the mystique that makes it work so well. The bottle is simplistic, but perfect. This fragrance doesn't have a gimmick or celebrity sponsor, it's just classy. The dark, purplish blue color of the bottle is an excellent representation of the scent in a hue.  OVERALL: To be honest, some of Lacoste's fragrances have left me underwhelmed. This one, however, is worth trying.

We were encouraged to see that this is put out by Guthy Renker, a well-known producer and marketer of high quality products over a lot of years. We first ran into the company back in the day, when they put out Tony Robbins' ""Personal Power"" series, and we used their teeth-whitening system as well.  From the female of the family -- I'm willing to spend good money on ""anti-aging"" products as long as they work (although there's really no such thing. You try and be the best you can for your age!). I was given a sample of ""Crepe Erase"" to review and I'm grateful, because I'd have to see a lot of 5-star reviews before I'd spend the money. Having said that, when it works, I'll dish out the dough -- I'm worth it!  I have used this daily for two months before I wrote the review, as you need time with something like this to prove that it works. I'm in my early 60s, and I can definitely see the signs of aging, and the reduction in youthful collagen that causes especially female skin to get that loose and ""crepey"" look.  This is a 2 step Treatment to tighten and smooth the skin. My impression: the Crepe Erase duo really do smooth thin, aging skin on the back of hands, arms, legs and neck area. The fragrance is fresh -- a light citrus. The treatment starts with an exfoliating scrub that buffs away dead skin, leaving the body smooth and clean. I only use the exfoliator every third or fourth day since it takes about that long for skin to shed a layer of cells. Skin remains buffed and smooth for several days.  The hydrating cream (""Intensive Body Repair Treatment"") is great to use every day. Living in arid Arizona, I have dry skin on my lower legs that I continually battle. Crepe Erase has helped with this, and I truly think it has reduced that look of crepey skin around my knees and upper legs. I love how the body cream works all day and doesn't quit before my next shower. I discovered many of my favorite ingredients in the cream; shea and coconut butter, coconut oil, olive oil and beeswax. One excellent ingredient in the duo is apple extract -- antioxidant and astringent, possessing a natural alpha hydroxy acid that helps remove dry skin. The acid-wash action of both the body polish and the cream work well for me. I am a long-term fan of exfoliating with alpha hydroxy acid because it's an easy method and does not require undue scrubbing, which can be hard on the skin itself. With the rich, long lasting and effective ingredients in the body cream, this is a winning combo for me.  By the way, there's no paraben and mineral oil in this, which are contraindicated these days.

The packaging is a glass bottle (not plastic) with a pump that lets you dispense just a tiny amount, which is very nice.  However the clear plastic top that sits over the dispenser was not on tight and some product had leaked out on to the bottle and inside the cardboard box.  Not a lot, but enough to warn against packing this in a travel bag or makeup bag.  The web site does not provide any information about ingredients.  This does not contain any sunscreen, so will be relegated primarily to night time use.  The list of ingredients is printed on the box, and this contains the usual things -- for example dimethicone, glycerin, talc, mica, PEG 10-15 cross polymer, butylene glycol, silica, fragrance, among others.  It does not state whether it is paraben free, which suggests it is not.  The color I received, No 4, is a light-medium shade that is on the cool side, without any yellow or pink undertones.  The fragrance is negligible.  On the skin this feels like it is at least partly silicone based, rather than  cream based.  It has very good slip but still covers quite well, without feeling at all heavy or oily.

I had given up on finding a foundation that I could wear without stinging and irritation - but as a Vine reviewer, this product was offered at no cost in exchange for my honest review, so I thought, what do I have to lose?  So glad I did....YAY!!!! I LOVE THIS!  First, it is very thick, and I thought it would go on heavy or cakey. Neither was the case. It spreads very evenly and nicely, takes very little to give the right touch to the whole face and neck. It smoothed to a silky finish that had me saying to my daughter, ""feel this!"" The coverage was excellent, without dimming the glow of natural complexion.  That has always a disappointment to me in other foundations, as I find that they make one look sort of dead, and more like a natural fiber canvas than a living being. Again, this was not my experience with this product. It evened out my skin tone and softened the lines and wrinkles, it gave a nice ""glow"" and felt wonderful.  As mentioned above, I have sensitive skin, and most liquid makeup and moisturizers make my skin sting, almost immediately, and without stop for hours until I wash it off. Even the stuff specially formulated for sensitive skin has not worked for me -- until this. Not only doesn't it irritate my skin, but I loved the look all day long - and even forgot to remove it when I went to bed. That's how wonderful it is.  The $30 price tag might seem a little much compared to drug store brands, but with the superior nature of the product, it's very much worth it to me.

I've been using it as directed morning and at bedtime for about a month and have had no negative reactions or results at all. Unfortunately, I have not been able to discern any positive results on my face either. I have some dry spots on the backs of both hands and occasionally apply a dab to those before applying a heavy moisturizer cream to my hands. I have seen an improvement there, but not on my face. It does make my skin feel soft and clean, but so does my much-cheaper aloe vera moisturizer (which I have continued to apply once the toner dries on my face and neck). Results might be more dramatic using several Obagi products together, but they are expensive. I like the product and the fact that most of the ingredients are natural. The scent is mild and dissipates when the toner dries. I have not noticed any tingling sensation on my skin when the product is applied. I have no complaints except that I don't see much in the way of results on my face. UPDATE: Since I wasn't seeing much improvement on my facial skin, I decided to try using this product on the backs of my hands. I have had very red, itchy blotches on the backs of both hands for a few years now, and they have been getting redder and itchier.

Here are her comments about it:  ""That's because it contains a high amount of the B vitamin niacinamide, which research has shown can improve excess melanin (skin pigment) production, lessening and potentially eliminating dark spots. The issue is that for many, treating dark spots takes more than one ingredient. To that end, La Roche Posay included phenethyl resorcinol, an ingredient that has some research showing it can help lighten dark spots! That's exciting, but we're skeptical the amount this serum contains is enough to kick in that benefit.  Even if you wanted to bank on the niacinamide alone, we wouldn't advise it due to the amount of alcohol this fragranced serum contains. It's the fourth ingredient, and in this position is likely to cause some amount of irritation that no one's skin needs.""  In this version, alcohol is actually the third ingredient, so its potential to irritate is even higher.  It's no wonder that some reviewers have experienced dry skin.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.  The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave.

Lappen,"Here's another 24 ounce pump jar of the best body lotion under the sun, a great size that lasts forever, at a price you can't beat with a stick, available complete with Amazon's free super-saver shipping.  Ahava is really a fantastic cream, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. A dab goes a long way, carries a delightful scent, and heals even the driest skin.  [Updated 12/10/2011: Regarding false comments of a political nature, please note: Ahava has done and is doing nothing illegal under international law, or otherwise, regarding its production facilities, regardless of the opinions of pro-Hamas folks. Obviously a campaign is afoot --- having nothing to do with Ahava's products or their quality --- to delegitimize Israel through boycotts like this.  Here are the facts, both historically and according to established international law. There is no final settlement in the disputed territories. The Palestinian contingent has repeatedly rejected at least five final settlements offered by Israel and its predecessors since the 1920s. The last formal proposal came in 2000 although several more attempts since have been made to arrive at final terms between the disputing parties.  Alas, current Palestinian Authority leaders are just as hard line as Hamas. They do not recognize Israel's right to statehood at all, and regularly so state in official media of every kind. A rhetorical question: How should Israel negotiate with people who openly envision another genocide? I have no answer, and those who boycott Ahava clearly do not either.  Historically, the last internationally recognized High Contracting Party in the disputed territories --- now known as the ""west bank,"" as in ""west bank of the Jordan River"" --- was the League of Nations. In 1922, the League established a Mandate for Palestine, entrusting its administration to the British government, which withdrew in 1948. The world's nations voted on this Mandate after World War I, (and Arabian royals in the Hijaz agreed), just as they voted on Mandates for Iraq, Syria, The Lebanon and so on. This land was intended as part of a national home for the Jewish people. The plan established by High Contracting Parties, and therefore international law, remained in force until Britain unilaterally and illegally established Trans-Jordan to appease the Sharif Feisal of Mecca, whose offspring unsuccessfully attempted to rule where originally assigned. The Palestine Mandate to establish a national home for the Jewish people included what is now generally called the ""west bank."" In 1948, after the United Nations recognized Israel as a state, Jordan rejected the settlement offered at that time, attacked the nascent Israel and illegally seized that land against dictates of international law. Jordan illegally controlled the land until 1967.  Jordan then bombed Jerusalem --- despite repeated peaceful Israeli attempts through diplomatic intermediaries to persuade Jordan not to do so. Israel counter-attacked --- a perfectly legal measure under international law for any established, recognized nation that is attacked.  Israel won the land in self-defense, and has repeatedly attempted to reach a final settlement with those people who claim it. Alas, any final settlement between the parties to the dispute must include an agreement to peace between them --- something the Palestinian Authority refuses to do, as this would require recognizing Israel, which it openly and repeatedly states it never will.  Therefore, under international law, Israel's presence in the disputed territories remains legal. Israel stole nothing from Palestinian Arabs. If their leaders choose to reject a final peace settlement, it's a shame. But international law requires that they do so for there to be any final settlement at all, much less a valid one.]  --- Alyssa A.

Though many people have noted a reduction in wrinkles, that is more what the LED attachment (not included) is for.  If you have seen med spa advertisements for a ""lunchtime face lift,"" they are talking about microcurrent facials.  The NuFACE is easy to use.  You just put a thin coat of the gel on your face, power it up, set it to your desired strength 1-5, and you are off.  My skin is not sensitive.  I started out on 3 but bumped it up to a 5 almost immediately.  When I did it near my jawline I had a slight metallic taste in my mouth, and sometimes I could feel the electricity but it wasn't even strong enough to be called a mild shock.  It felt like a gentle,  rapid tapping and was by no means unpleasant or painful in the slightest.  Most of the time I didn't feel anything at all but the smooth metal balls gliding over my skin.  It is easy to get the timing right but no big deal if you don't.  For problem areas you can even hold it on one spot on your face for awhile without moving it.  I did half my face then asked my daughter to compare.  She quickly guessed which side I had done, stating that my skin looked better.  I personally noticed a bit of a brow lift.  When my husband came home that evening I asked him to take another look at my face and he said he could tell a difference as well.  I also took before and after pictures, and can tell a difference.  I have used it for three days now.  It is really easy to work into my routine.  I just wash my face in the morning, do the NuFACE for about 5 minutes, wipe the gel off, and go on about my day.  I decided to do some research on microcurrent as a beauty treatment, and found that it has been around for many years and popular with the Hollywood set.  The level of electricity mimics what is present in the human body anyway, though that decreases with age, so it is completely safe for most of us.  People with pacemakers should not use it, people with thyroid issues should avoid the thyroid area, and everyone should avoid using it on the chest area to avoid getting your heart out of rhythm.  Microcurrent started out as a medical treatment as a pain therapy and also to help people suffering from palsy or stroke to lift their drooping facial muscles back in place.  It stimulates your body to produce more collagen and more amino acids, both which lead to a more youthful and lifted appearance.  If you read unbiased reviews such as by users on YouTube, etc., you will see that pretty much everyone loves it.  The NuFACE is not as strong as the ""lunchtime face lift"" microcurrent treatments advertised by med spas, but that just means it takes longer to see the full effect, not that they are less effective.  And five minutes at home each morning is easier, less time-consuming and less expensive than med spa treatments twice a week for six weeks, which is the recommended start up treatment, with less frequent follow-up treatments thereafter.  NuFACE does not interfere with facial injections such as Botox or Juvederm, though you should not use any microcurrent treatment for about two weeks after having the injections.  After that it is business as usual, and there is some evidence that microcurrent actually makes the injectables last longer and helps to reduce the amount needed.  Yes, the NuFACE is expensive and is not for everyone.  However, if you have been tempted by the ""lunchtime face lifts"" or regularly get med spa treatments, or are just really not pleased with the signs of aging on your face and are willing and able to invest that kind of money, NuFACE is an excellent way to bring back some of the youthful skin tone, fullness and tightness.  It is a hefty initial investment, but check out the unbiased reviews for yourself, do your own research, and figure you can spend that cash now for a piece of equipment you can use quickly and easily in your own home for years, or you can get a handful of spa treatments that will last at the most a few months.",Med spa technology at home,1438300800,283.0,,trainer power even taste bump wash come treatment say wipe figure actually electricity advertise medical injection last nuface get many botox sure read really business tell right cash yes kind shock easy home quickly mimic tap ball bit almost would heart metal amino lift please easily effective juvederm facial overall set two meant without call go alternative time-consuming do note derma-rolled much amount like level suffering could start week handful usual injectables user hold everyone follow-up mouth spend spas palsy problem exfoliate ask money well appearance see pacemaker one personally help compare day acids metallic effect desire lead awhile help time rhythm spend issue etc felt also area anyway see five year human side though take interfere tone use invest chest three noticed picture sign slight mild spot note microcurrent masqued week use bright work longer investment step youthful however lift near half expensive thereafter area stroke tighten enough age take big moisturize gel initial mean muscle less found look daughter face brow reduction back deal place state able good drooping take use talk hollywood sensitive guess slight present sometimes check rapid produce strength start make willing avoid piece best move equipment beauty look body well research time another strong difference look unbiased age med fill painful gliding wrinkle way smooth immediately skin collagen attachment tightness completely six thyroid stimulates jawline recommend therapy brighten minute feel fullness routine pain tempt gentle put safe include need lift morning popular spa twice treatment facial youtube hefty reduce cheap want light full thin frequent month decide love advertisement lunchtime decrease item coat even easy husband lead day biore-d bring review around excellent evidence make people regularly unpleasant get anything pretty

It really isn't an under eye cream for the night. It's a moisturizing complex for the day time or evening time that can be worn over makeup to add a bit of pearl essence to the eyes.  In the summer I use it under eyes on bare skin after applying moisturizer and then pat a little foundation in powder form on top. In the winter, I apply it under the liquid foundation and then dab a bit on top too. I don't think it will work for those who have deep dark circles.

What I found, instead, was completely fine! But let me start with the results. I'm an extreme skeptic about eye treatments in general, because I think they cost a lot for results I don't really see. I genuinely was not expecting much from this one either, but when I took off the tissue, the results were dramatic. I have olive skin and am prone to puffiness and darkness around my eyes. This eye treatment made the area around my eyes dramatically better. I took before and after pictures just to be sure I wasn't imagining it. The effect seems to last for at least a few hours.  Now in terms of the application, it seems to me that the product designers had this challenge of how to put the serum that they know works under the eyes for a period of time. Tissue paper itself would probably disintegrate while a sponge material wouldn't stay in place on your face. They came up with what feels a bit like rice paper. When you see it in the package, it looks much sturdier and more sponge-like than it is. I accidentally nicked off a piece of one because I didn't realize how fragile it was. But it really is the perfect vehicle for the liquid. I don't see how it is hard to apply, like others have said. You just pour a bit on to saturate and then put it under your eyes. And that's where you can see the application really works. When you put it on your face, it looks like how you'd imagine putting a wet tissue on your face would look. It holds to your face completely. Is it a liquid? Yes, so you need to pour it while standing over a sink, but that's not a big deal. And you want to be careful not to pour too much over just the first pad. But they give you plenty for both eyes in a vial. And with practice, I imagine being able to conserve enough for two applications per vial. But of course, I wouldn't have enough of those cool rice paper pads. The serum has no smell and is not sticky. It has the consistency of water.  The price, of course, is the downside. It's about $12/treatment.

You can aim it to get the lotion exactly where you want it, since the stream is thin and the lotion comes out with pinpoint accuracy.  Now to describe this light, subtle fragrance.  The jasmine is the first topnote to meet my nostrils.  And everyone loves jasmine.  A white rose is the next note. I would have chosen water hyacinth as the middle note, although this mentions sandlewood (which would be a bassnote) and lemon for the middle note. And yes, the lemon is there, but I had to search for it, which is for me unfortunate as it is the most favorable note in fragrances for my body chemistry.  There is also something of water, clean laundry, sunshine, with rainclouds on the horizon.  The lemon peeks out in the dry down.  The initial happy aroma quickly dies down into a skin scent.  What is left is a silky, watery moisture drenching my thirsty skin, and I keep putting my arm to my nose to inhale the soft, delicate sunny scent.

The longer bristles are nylon and the shorter ones are boar bristle. It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.  All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.  There are two things you need to know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort.  One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you'd do better with a larger size.  The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want a mixed bristle brush like this one that is part boar bristle and part nylon? What is most comfortable and performs the best with your hair. This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick. Otherwise, you'll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. Mason Pearson also makes an All Boar Bristle Brush for finer or shorter hair but I have never tried it.  So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair. I bought it for myself but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won't reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs. My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair. This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it's worth it. If you're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.

I have hair that is impossible to curl, so I'm not the best reviewer for that, but it did keep a beautiful flat iron curl for a few minutes, per my normal. LOL  DO pay attention to the recommended heating levels. My hair used to fine; is more in the middle now.  But when I couldn't get the curls to stay I turned it up to max but it left weird crimping in my hair... I'm hoping it's not damaged now although it seems fine after washing.  I've never had a curling or flat iron do that, so I know it can go up higher than most, which is great if you need that level but no so great if you aren't being careful!  I love the grip... it's sensitive to your touch, so if you aren't using it for three minutes it will turn off; otherwise it can sense you are holding it and it stays on. It's easy to turn on and see what temperature you are at (and it has three color levels for even easier remembrance); and the biggest thing... you can't easily adjust the temperature WHILE you are curling. I've had major issues with my irons turning off on other models just by gripping it. Not with this one at all.  The hot part is a bit smaller than most flat irons, but it did such a nice job smoothing out my ""easy to frizz"" straight hair that I didn't care. Made it sleek and smooth.

Results are not instantaneous, but require weeks of consistent treatment, so when people say it is all that and a bag of chips, what they see in the mirror is what they wish to see.  That being said, this tool appears to do what it claims to do, stimulate the collagen which plumps up slight wrinkles in facial skin over bone, and anything else is a byproduct of the attention the user is likely also giving to their skin while using the Tria.  Try the Tria on your cleansed and dried off forearm to be sure you recognize the prickly sensation that will be felt on the face.  Use it on a cleansed and dried off face, avoiding the eyes, staying on areas that cover bone, following a four sectioned or zoned order.  I have found that as suggested in the Tria online video, I prefer to move the device vertically along my forehead area and horizontally along the remaining three zones.  I then use a facial serum and moisturizer to rehydrate the skin and I drink a glass of water to rehydrate my interior.  It is suggested to perform this ritual five out of seven nights a week prior to bed for twelve weeks, raising the stimulation from one to three as you can tolerate the prickling sensation.  Stimulation is increased with the levels as is the timing for eachieving zone.  My sensitive skin showed no adverse reaction at any stage, that is no redness, darkening or burning.  I also religiously apply sunscreen during the day and would do this if I did nothing else to my face.  This is a good tool and becomes easier to use over time because it becomes second nature to move the laser area along the face.  For the first few nights, I found that I had difficulty getting it to move smoothly and if it did not touch the skin, the laser stopped working.  Initially, that was frustrating, then I discovered that by assuring that my skin was completely dry after being cleansed and then carefully regulating the pressure with which I moved it across my face, the two minute treatment went by as quickly as the two minute cycle of my electric toothbrush.

Although I did see improvement in my skin, I have concerns about both the performance and design of this system  The product is packaged in an attractive teal box.  The system itself is encased in rather cheap looking plastic and contains a separate power cord, three diamond heads and some filters. There is an adequate dvd that should be viewed prior to use. It is easy enough to set up although the heads are hard to remove.  First you decide which area of the face or body you are going to treat. You then choose which tip to use: normal for body and less sensitve areas, fine for face and sensitve areas or precision for delicate and hard to reach areas such as around the lips and nose. A small disposable filter is placed between the device and the head. Choose the level of suction--I never used anything greater than the first level.  Holding the skin taut, you then glide the head across the area two or three times. The skin is sucked into the vacuum where the diamond tip exfoliates.  I have mildly sensitive skin and found this device a bit rough. Although the DVD states that pinkness is to be expected and will disappear after a short time, I found mine lasted into the next day. I decided to use the device only once a week as opposed to the recommended two to three times a week sugested. My device also did not go over my skins as smoothly as demonstrated in the instruxtional dvd. Based on my reaction to the more gentle tips, I did not use around my eyes.  I did see results.  After the first treatment, my skin was velvety soft. After seven weeks of one use per week, I did notice some slight refinement overall. This year, I developed a small but annoying  line over my lips. It is like a light smoker's line (although I've never smoked), It probably annoys me more than it should. It has diminshed but not disappeared.  I would avoid this machine if you have very sensitve skin or adjust your usage as I did. This may delay the results. Overall softness was the most noticeable benefit although there were other small improvements. I would have preferred a retractable, longer power cord. The tips should be replaced after ten uses and the filters must also be replaced. So factor in the associated costs. (You can get the parts on amazon.)I did not experience the suction loss others complained about. I wish the tips were easier to remove and were marked in different colors.  This is a pricey machine.

For reference, my hair is shoulder blade length, not too thick, mostly straight with a little wave and some tendency to frizz. This produced lovely beachy waves, truly similar to what I see when I've let my hair dry in a bun at the beach, but smoother and shinier.  My only disappointment was the tendency for the waves to fall out quite a bit over the first couple of hours. Perhaps using a strong hairspray rather than a sea salt spray would hold more (though I think I'd like it less) as well as using maximum heat, though I felt setting 4 out of 5 should be adequate for my hair texture.  The shape of a curling wand really lends itself to a natural looking style and getting more of the length of my hair in contact with the barrel. Yes, you have to wrap your hair around and hold the tips in place, so there's more risk of a burn if you aren't careful. The glove protects well, though it made it harder me to deal with the hair, so I tend to take my chances without it. The technique is different than a curling iron, but I didn't find it too difficult to master.  For the money, you're getting a beautiful and high quality instrument. The ability to change out the barrel for other styles will be valuable to some, if it's worth paying for more; I'll stick to this one. I think the ceramic and tourmaline really contribute to shininess. I also like the ability to select a temperature. If you have never used a wand, I'd suggest starting with something lower cost to see if you like using this shape of wand. But if you're ready to invest in a great one, I have no cautions about this selection.","Smooth, shiny, natural looking waves",1446163200,2.0,,fall hairspray texture contribute master contact heat i'll lovely i've find quite wave tendency caution natural sea like beach curl dry hour straight add salt maximum wrap think cost hold lend high length shape i'd take disappointment wand harder change careful something great different blade iron money ability happy less burn glove thick little really suggest tool one tool quality make deal frizz place technique hair similar let beautiful barrel yes spray set use worth shiny couple truly style shininess first ready bit produced perhaps would mostly wave adequate felt also pay see go-to reference temperature chance difficult select tend bun smoother tip never i'm style around stick overall instrument without though risk there's valuable shoulder use well beachy ceramic tourmaline get invest strong style start look low selection protect rather

This stuff is great and the price is right too, compared to other lines I mentioned below.  I highly recommend this cream, again if you can tolerate the fragrance which I have gotten used to. ----------------------  I have been using and exploring skin care for quite some time now, so I have had a chance to use many different brands at a wide variety of price points.  Let's see how Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex compares to the creams I have used.  WHAT TYPES OF CREAMS HAVE I USED Some of the creams that I have used are as follows Lancome Absolue Lancome Renergie Multi Action Algenist Firm and Lift Algenist Genius Loreal Vitalift Yes to Blueberries L'Occitane SKII L'Oreal Genesis LaPrarie Clarins Christian Dior (variety of them) Chanel Shiseido  The above list only reflects some of the brands I have had a chance to explore and test out.  Keeping this in mind, I will compare this cream for effectiveness and what results it achieves.  WHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE? Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex is indicated to be for mature skin that is post menopausal.  That means that the targets are for plumping skin, shrinking pores, radiance, making skin feel denser (thus more youthful), contours, and more of an even tone to skin.  This cream does not have SPF in it which I am THRILLED about.  If you want to use SPF, then you can put it on yourself.  The jar is glass another feature that I like.  It has a tight fitting cap with an inner seal which helps the cream from drying out.  The color is a beautiful iridescent peach color glass and the cream inside is an icy peachy pink color.  It is a bit thicker than the night version of this cream&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vichy-Neovadiol-Replenishing-Care-Night-Cream-1-69-fl-oz/dp/B017R8MYGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vichy Neovadiol Replenishing Care Night Cream, 1.69 fl. oz.</a>.  HOW DOES THIS CREAM PERFORM? When applying this cream, it is extremely lightweight- not at all thick and sticky like you might expect.  It goes on easily and absorbs VERY quickly into the skin.  The best way to put it on is to dot about a lentil to pea sized dot on each quadrant of the face and then spread it into the skin.  There is a very heavy scent to this, which I have to be honest at first with the night cream made me want to retch, but I quickly got used to it.  Many people would probably find it pleasant, but at first it was hard to get used to.  I have used this with the night cream at night so the combination of the action is to be considered.  I find that the cream leaves my skin very plump, glowy, moisturized for 12 hours until I use the night cream, and there is absolutely no sticky residue.  I find that it does seem to work best when I apply&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Natural-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Liquid/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99% Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Liquid</a>&nbsp;on BEFORE any moisturizer and after cleansing the skin.  I use this with all skin care as it improves performance greatly.  This skin care line will enable you to have a much better canvas to use makeup on for older women.  I do makeup on older women quite often and one of the biggest problems is not using really good skin care first.  This skin care (along with the night cream) will greatly improve the skin so that makeup application will be much nicer and less apt to look caked on.  I would say that this is an excellent skin care line for mature skin if you can tolerate the fragrance.  WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM Excellent price for what you get Glass jar A little goes a long way It is not sticky Absorbs quickly Differences begin quickly Does what it promises  WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM Fragrance is a bit overbearing.  THE BOTTOM LINE I have to say compared to the other lines of skin care that I have tried over the years on myself and on others whose skin I work on, this line of Neovadiol Compensating Complex is a serious contender for performance with good price range compared to high end.  I would put it in the same ball park as some of Lancome, Algenist, Dior, SKII, and I find it even better than some Chanel, Shiseido, Clarins, and L'Oreal (although this company appears to have ties with L'Oreal).  I really do not like the heavy scent, but I did get used to it.  It does not make my eyes water, and it fades away quick enough to be able to use it.  For the price vs performance, compared to other lines, I have to say this is a five star, although I am tempted to give it four stars due to the fragrance.

There are two things you need to know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you'd do better with a larger size.  The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want all nylon, like this Detangler? Even though the Detangler is all nylon, some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter, just like the mixed bristle brush. It's hard to see in the picture. You should know that the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a bristle brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.  The Detangler is a brush just like the other brushes, not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing. It is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also. Even though my hair is very short, it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick. This handy size is about eight inches long.  It's quite a large expense to buy any Mason Pearson product compared to other manufacturers of hair care items--it's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it's worth it. If you're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.

But at the same time, knowing how much waste goes into this is also a bit frustrating and I wished there was a little spatula rather than capsules.  To use, each capsule has a little tab on top to break off and then squeeze the premeasured amount onto your fingertip.  You then spread this across the areas that could use some wrinkle reduction - e.g., eyes and mouth lines.  This is for fine lines, of course - it won't remove all lines or the deeper wrinkles. But in reducing the smaller wrinkles, you will notice a difference.  This has a light and not problematic scent - you won't notice its on once it seeps into skin.
