I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.  This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.  Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.  Why X? Did you know, for example, that: - X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there? - Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters? - Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine? - X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain? - Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums?

Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs.

Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story: 1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in ""Dickensian"" England. 2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade.

An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression. -An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future. -Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.  ""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone."" ""Thank God,"" Slade responds. ""It's worse,"" Latham says.  A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!"" ""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do.""  A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him. -As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged. -Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet. -The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed. ""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?"" ""Humbug?""","Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique",1224892800,,,rightly man's devil away transform nice hard ghost realistic stay played door jack radio hell reform i've sample mister work welfare small fire feature like unemployed expense appear convince offer movie way news believe evil character supernatural america scrooge actually world think reply others job bookseller book generous sick chase latham many bad ghost england thing miser warehouse take great businessman unique later money responds age dickens quote good humbug read spirit music christmases employee bargain star word utter see god grump caroler frequently business transformation new back future original place pitchfork american whole point repossess believe sing use stunning adaption benedict effect item bite bit light full slade's unplugged present history power practical town snazzes also repossess still complete eve even truck congratulates thank provide thatcher concern wrinkler man henry incredible slade hardnosed make herald either never christmas say short asks broken superb stick around carol classic story yet old orphanage progress brimstone look excellent comment take deceased life customer include sentiment wonderful son snazz-o-scale printed people go partner past show save drive another instantaneous anything broadcast he's depression generosity

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.  I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.

As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it develops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals himself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so refreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status that resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.

442,442,5,False,"09 3, 2014",A3FS7RSDQ7JSWC,0005119367,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Nina Kish,"This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: ""Outstanding Miniseries."" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular ""Bible Collection"" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as ""proof."" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish","Initially, bound and betrayed.

Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.

The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.

Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.

The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....""slightly"" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the ""edit"" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).  It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to ""leaven the whole loaf"" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the ""Sampson"" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it!

Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively.

I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review. This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch! Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say! Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon. Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's ""My God, my God..."" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story. When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears. As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society. 'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.

Gleeson,"This excellent production is without doubt the  best version of the Joseph story that I've ever seen, treating fully and thoughtfully every aspect of this greatest ever ""rags to riches"" tale. It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who distinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters. The production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the ""rape"", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story. The performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his ""body language"" often outdoes his spoken  one. There are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of ""7 years"",  is not always the most probable one.

Unfortunately, only a few of the songs feature all of the actions (hand motions and body movement) that make these songs favorites for children.  It's such a shame, because the primary reason I bought this DVD was to encourage full-body participation and movement instead of passive viewing.  Still, the production is good-quality (not overproduced and grating like the DVD of the same name by Golden Books).  When our kids leave it on and walk away, it actually makes decent background music, as children's music goes.  To be sure, this is the best children's music DVD we own (yes, even more popular with our kids than the Wiggles) -- that is, until we find a DVD of action Bible songs that actually features the actions.","Our kids love it -- but where are the ""actions""?",1114819200,27.0,,mountain away wiggle go hand find rock action passive feature like farm song actually children's action walk child video favorite shame many name sure song dvd overproduce contains golden motion unfortunately music interesting scene grate bible movement love quality popular primary favorite act reason yes good singing encourage participation full remember climb background sunshine decent still production even leave book full-body noah childhood kid make buy view play word best instead behind body make good-quality animal climb feature

The 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.  Mr. Gibson's ""The Passion"" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)  This is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense ""The Passion.""  This film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the ""Gospel According to Luke.""  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.  Alright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.  I'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read ""Luke,"" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.  The sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in ""The Passion."" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.  Like I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,"" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.  Another thing I should point out is that ""The Passion"" is NOT child friendly. ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of ""The Passion."" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from ""Luke."" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in ""The Passion.""  Another thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written ""Good News Bible.""  I like ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""The Passion.""

The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.  The Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.  Brian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.  Many of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).  What is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.  There are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:  Besides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.  There is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.  Even though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.

An Italian production by the Paulines, with writer/director Alberto Castellani and cinematographer/director Giancarlo Cappellano, it takes us through the significant sites in the Holy Land, and also blends in exquisite works of art, from masters like Duccio and his contemporaries, and iconic treasures of Greek and Russian origin.  It delves into the archeological evidence of the Bible, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the many miracles of Jesus, His life as an observant Jew, historical perspectives, and much more. The mixture of music used is also good, and ranges from dramatic melodies to beautiful cantorial singing. This is a 2-sided DVD, with 5 chapters on each side, and is playable in either English or Spanish, and the Spanish narration overall has a better audio quality. It must be noted that the film does not have a Hollywood multi-million $ look, as the color reproduction in the art work is a little off at times, and it is slightly grainy, but not bothersome at all, as the content overrides its flaws. Informative, wonderfully photographed, and occasionally quite moving, this is an excellent addition to anyone's library of Christian films, and will be of interest to those of any faith who wish to learn more about Jesus, and the historical roots of Christianity.

This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion. The movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him. The suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.  IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.  AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"".","Not the real Frosty sequel- see ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" for real sequel",1133827200,3.0,,know visual narrator look television frosty's second santa play premise jack paul frosty work return rankin/bass character plot snoopy name steve like panic feature men abc coker complaint approach movie start john song know half character talent seller nelson cbs jealous nothing folk high length wonderland frost sabotage winter voice change claus big sung brown shelley different unique musical know real clean song king interested wife voice long left theatrical director ok actor fun star jr write romeo narrate jimmy bill rankin/bassis one special griffith title return back feature quality original make vernon right director snow regular act unsettling direct crystal rudolph use july first design team hour major andy want studio cartoon watch snowman time center rollins terrific buy town winter also writer street holiday sort production standard work sequel see voice maury animator else credit ticket tv production kid muller continuity release goodman show free air christmas special policeman base story classic law without look interestingly melendez durante fight basic famous well jackie get show charlie peanuts jonathon remove get letter another lose pretty

One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.  As the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.  It starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.  The baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.  I'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.  One drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.  Not helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.  Kids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.

The film stars actor Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.  The special was created using stop motion animation called ""Animagic,"" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).  `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.  Whereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.  For over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.  Blu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.  Blu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.  Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:  Sadly none has been provided.  Finally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!  Andrew C.

The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation ""on two's and three's"" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.  When I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, ""Be Prepared to Pay"" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).  Santa Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.  In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says ""It's not even safe here,"" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.  Okay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray.

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word ""Claus"" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.  This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful ""My World is Beginning Today"" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with ""Put One Foot In Front of the Other"" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.  In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.

One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.  I watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.  But there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.  It is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.  But thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials.

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.  Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.  Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!  Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.

""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" tells the story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus. It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.

I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better. SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage. This was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock. I suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while.

Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques. This fact aside, ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun. All the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive. The songs are excellent, from the familiar ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"" to the lovely ""My World Is Beginning Today"" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.) The script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge. This has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV.

Unlike any other Bible study available, this visually stunning DVD series is taught and written by biblical experts - six professors with specialized areas of knowledge. The three volumes in this study series are :  1.  The Parables of Jesus 2.  The Prayers of Jesus 3.  Miracles of Jesus  The Teachers featured on the series are : Dr. Gary Burge, Wheaton College; Dr. David Garland, Truett Theological Seminary; Dr. Mark Strauss, Bethel Seminary; Dr. Michael Wilkins, Talbot School of Theology; Dr. Matt Williams, Biola University; Dr. Ben Witherington III, Asbury Theological Seminary.  Hosted by Jarrett Stevens and filmed in locations as diverse as Gloucester harbor, the Holy Land, Boston's Old North Church, and Chicago's lakefront, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different instructor and consists of three components:  1. Historical and cultural background 2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning 3. Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible's message to life today  Each volume is accompanied by a Participant Guide which is available separately allowing participants to make deeper connections with a knowledge of historical background of the Bible, biblical text, and real life applications.  'The Parables of Jesus: Six In-depth Studies Connecting the Bible to Life' is one of the volumes of the Deeper Connections series focusing on parables of Jesus. Jesus communicated deep spiritual truths through simple, vivid, and engaging stories. Woven from the stuff of everyday life, the parables of Jesus made the kingdom of God understandable and accessible to his listeners. The study helps you gain new insights into his parables and their meanings that will help you to appreciate more fully their relevance for your own life.

When I heard that the first two volumes in the new Holy Land Series were released on DVD, I immediately knew I had to go shopping! :)  Dave Stotts, the host of Drive Thru History again brings viewers into the world of fascinating history in Volume 1: Egypt to Qumran - Covenants, Kings, and the Promised Land; and in Volume 2: Jericho to Megiddo - Conquest, Canaanites, and the Holy City. Each volume contains three episodes for a total of 85-90 minutes.  Typical of Dave Stotts, he brings history to life with his intriguing historical facts and well-done visual effects. And let's not forget his quirky humor! This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.  As I watched these movies, I had several ""ah hah"" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well. The archeological evidence is astounding! My favorite part was seeing the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and then finding out a bit about the men who discovered the amazing scrolls while herding sheep.  Perfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library. There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested. Also, the brief information about David slaying Goliath may scare very young viewers if they are not familiar with the account.

The show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch.

Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.  Marc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world.

Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.  In Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called ""Perfect Christmas"". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!  For example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?  Buster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with ""Baxter Day"" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.  Arthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an ""authentic"" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.  Holidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.  I bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay.

What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history. As much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - ""Evil Hill"" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of ""didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet). The DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a ""making of"" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film. Is it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.

There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.  Before attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).

""Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth"" may be a better title.  Tonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.  Also, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the ""Spritual Warm-Up"", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular ""stretching"" video.  The practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.  The introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to ""Acres 4 Life"" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.

The companion DVD (available separately and highly recommended) is a gem in which Rufus jams with two of the finest contemporary musicians illustrating various aspects of the text.  The DVD is worth the price just as a performance video.  While loosely defined as a method, the ""Evolving Bassist"" is really more of a well thought out approach to playing the instrument.  The skills taught follow several threads of theory and practice, but it's not a beginner tutorial even though very early players will benefit from the material...and continue to benefit throughout their playing career.

It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.  The first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.  The film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.  Oliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.

I am fairly certain that I saw this in the theater and then a million times on the Disney Channel, but have not seen it since the mid 80's when I was very young.  When I started to watch, I noticed how it was similar in concept to Gotcha! (1985), with an American civilian mixed up in international intrigue. And as much as I still like Gotcha!, Condorman is the superior movie. Gotcha! is all nerdy hormones and awkwardness, while Condorman just rolls out fantastic comic book surprises one after the next.  For an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie. Barbara Carrera went on to be a Bond girl opposite Sean Connery 2 years later, and is very much a Bond girl here and Oliver Reed plays a menacing villain.  Even though The Cat From Outer Space (1978) has more than 6 actors with speaking lines, and a cast filled with recognizable stars from TV and Disney movies, Condorman is just as much fun.  The Region 2 Disney UK DVD comes with no special features. Audio options are English, French and German. With Subtitles options being English, French and German as well. The credits all come at the beginning of the movie, which was how credits were done until George Lucas changed the industry with Star Wars, so the lack of end credits seems a bit jarring.

1022,1022,4,False,"05 24, 2009",A2HVL790PBWYTU,0764005529,{'Format:': ' DVD'},H. Bala,"CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.  Some SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.  A conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.  Woody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.  Cut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.  So, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.  Michael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a ""foolish dreamer who draws comic books"" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.  It helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...  CONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game-of-X/dp/0441273084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game of X</a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.  When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl.

When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.  Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.  Seeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.  The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.  A lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.  Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard.

It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.  I had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).  The only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.  The CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.  Barbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.  The only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.  What follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history. It's all great fun and it's executed perfectly.  For high flying escapist entertainment they don't come much more downright enjoyable than this. The DVD is a disappointment with no special features to speak off except a rather slim production notes section in the inside cover booklet. It's 2 pages of notes on the making of the movie, with sections on 'The Story,' 'The Setting,' 'Gadgetry' and 'Stunts and Special Effects,' but it's all very slim pickings.  But, I've had this movie in my DVD collection for over two years and on those quiet rainy Saturday's it's a particular favorite (along with 1980s FLASH GORDON) to put in my DVD player and sit back and remember a more innocent time in my life.

Wheeler,"For some reason it seems fashionable to criticize this production, mainly because it carries old footage from Masterpiece Theatre, hosted by Russell Baker.  Further, this film was sponsored by Mobil Oil Co. and produced by the BBC.  In addition, some reviewers may see it competing with the classic starring John Mills and Alec Guinness from 1947.  Moreover, since this 1999 film was made, weve had the 2011 production starring Gillian Anderson and other versions, as well.  But viewers who fail to see this 3-hour epic from 1999 are really missing the best rendition of what may be Charles Dickens best novel.  The story is timeless and inspiring; the romance, touching and well-portrayed.  TV simply cant be better than this.  Casting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.  The ending of this story is not really a happy one.  Abel Magwich meets a grisly end, Miss Havisham is burned alive, and the romance between Pip and Estella seems to be in limbo.  One has to be reminded that Charles Dickens wrote the story and did two versions of the ending.  This is the happier of the two.  I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they find fault with how dark and grim this production seems.  Im sure its exactly what Dickens would have wanted and exactly right for 1999.  No, I wouldnt object if the video were re-mastered into true HD-widescreen but I felt Id waited long enough to see this flim again.  No sign of a re-generation was found from BBC so I purchased it at a decent price on the secondary market.  If and when a re-mastered version of this classic appears I will want to buy it.

Dickens is so cruel we cannot imagine he is a man, what's more a humane human being.  A poor orphan, Pip, is raised by a poor blacksmith. A life of rough and tough luck. Take it or leave it, but there is no way out, except the radical one. And he dreams of being a gentleman one day. An aberration of course, morally wrong and bad taste.  He is selected and invited by Miss Havisham, a deranged rich woman who is mourning in total decay and sorrow after the failure of her wedding when the bridegroom did not come, twenty years before. Her objective is to provide a male companion and eventually husband to her adopted daughter, Estella.  But one night on the moor Pip is ""accosted"" by an prison escapee of some kind who asks for food and the boy of six or seven, maybe eight provides in the night, including a file for him to get rid of his manacles. He will turn up as his benefactor.  Luck, luck and luck. But then systematically Dickens shatters every single opportunity and hope on the side of the boy, Pip, who ends up in prison for unpaid debts, on the side of his benefactor, Abel, who will die in prison holding Pip's hand after his final arrest, on the side of Miss Havisham who will achieve none of her plans, on the side of Estella who will marry the rich and noble young man, will be brutalized and will end up alone in Miss Havisham's house, on the side of Biddy who will marry Joe the Blacksmith when Pip finally realizes she had been his closest ever friend, and even on the side of Estella who will refuse to requite Pip's love, though she will accept to make him her platonic companion in Miss Havisham's.redecorated house.  That cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.  I just wonder if here Dickens does not reach Zola's pessimism who considered that anyone born in a criminal circle could only be that and drag everyone around him down into that criminal circle. No salvation for those who are badly born. The belief in an elected people turned into a savage and wild social Darwinism: some have been elected to be crushed and powdered by life as slowly as possible for them to regret ever being born but absolutely unable to shorten the ordeal.

Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)  - This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.  - Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.  - This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.  One positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen.

Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very ""Dickenseque.""  One of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more ""sensitive and kind"" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.  Another aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.  One disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were ""too lazy"" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character ""fill in"" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.  Approximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.

The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point: 2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly. I mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage? 3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort? I give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery.",Not a good movie,1087344000,11.0,,know joe he's give panorama treat explain go much cooly i've wave none enjoy plot like understand adult marriage however tunnels movie fly boat time character guess watch next lot book row cruel get fall soft spent dark haversham secondhand enough opening estella great storyline cryptic minute dickens good choppy read long director scene star little mannered really bbc love series back pip historical walking point bird hallways act good editing/screenplay child stair bore lack come super drama there're almost honestly interaction result love miss sort especially get would what's hear heartless also grown-up street novels water tv lead scenery second unhappy madly moor never extend door mean total instead gentleman-trap conversation convict life seem happens discontinuity there's assume kindly base say unbalanced movies/tv lady expectation pretty

1050,1050,3,True,"02 18, 2003",ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,0764006401,{'Format:': ' VHS Tape'},T.NAKAJIMA,"This is a Master Theatre Version made in 1999, of Dickens' oft-filmed book which comes with stunningly beautiful photography and most strange decision about adapting the original book.  As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first. The story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake. I do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune. Justine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that? The portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham. Overall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.

The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray  THOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.  THE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention.

Two enemies (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune ) on opposite sides of the war end up stranded on a deserted island together. At first they fight for resources before realizing that they need each other to escape back to civilization.  Boorman does a terrific job setting up his compositions (with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall), working with the actors. Both Mifune and Marvin were old enough to serve during World War II so, no doubt, brought some of the memories of the racist view that the Americans and Japanese had of each other during that time. I have to say that I prefer the alternate ending to the one that played in theaters as it doesn't pay off on the journey these two enemies make to becoming friends as they work towards a common goal.  The Blu-ray release from Kino does a good job of presenting the film. The film looks a bit soft in its presentation but I don't doubt this is what the film probably looked like originally during its theatrical run and the intent of Hall. It's always hard to judge because memory can be unreliable. The depth is a bit problematic at times while detail and colors are pretty good.  The audio is presented in 2.0 channel and sounds solid enough.  Lalo Schifrin's score sounds quite nice. We get subtitles in English only (although the Japanese dialog is subtitled in English as well).  Kino provides some interesting and very good special features. Unfortunately, we don't get a commentary track from Boorman but there is a 30 minute interview with him discussing the film. The commentary by Film Historians Travis Crawford and Bill Ackerman is quite good covering the history of the production and various tidbits. The alternate ending is seamlessly branched so you can choose that ending (which I feel is superior but you may have a different opinion if you saw this when it was originally theatrically released). Art director Anthony Pratt  weighs in the production design for the minimalist film in a 11 minute featurette. Kinko also provides five trailers (but curiously not one for ""Hell In the Pacific"").  ""Hell In The Pacific"" is an exceptional film. It's a pity that we don't get any sort of surround mix for the sound (it could be that the 2.0 mix is the only remaining version of the soundtrack).

Strictly a ""two-hander"", (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), the latter speaking only Japanese throughout...no subtitles. You have to rely on Marvin's dialogue, and Mifune's expression. Now this is not as hard as it may sound.  It's also burdened with what has to be the weirdest selection of music as the soundtrack, varying from full church organ, loud discordant atonal concrete music and what surely has to be the sounds of air being allowed to escape from the stretched neck of a rubber balloon at one stage!  A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay. At first the motivations seem to be to kill, but gradually that changes to a power play for dominance over and degradation of the other. The upper hand changes, but gradually realisation sets in that they will have to work together to survive, or even just get along. The astute may note that as the two are gradually stripped of the trappings of civilisation, they in fact eventually become more ""civilized"", ....and when later some of the outward comforts of the civilised world are available to them,such as clean clothes, shaving and alcohol/cigarettes/magazines, they then fall back into barbarism. Performances are good, ....although Marvin is perhaps a little too old for the character he's playing. The settings are genuine and their misery well-portrayed as they fight off thirst, starvation and the elements, ...even the sheer boredom. There is a somewhat odd scene where Marvin tries to teach Mifune to retrieve a stick as a dog would....Mifune is tied most uncomfortably to some sort of a large branch at the time as well as  being hobbled. Just who is teaching whom is open to interpretation as Mifune refuses and remains mute and impassive.....while Marvin continually demonstrates the demeaning task. Realising that no one is coming to rescue them, eventually the two begin to tolerate each other, then go further to co-operate enough to build a raft substantial enough to get over the surrounding reef. This being achieved, they sail off on the open ocean in search of rescue. A plane is heard, but when Marvin tries to use an old whistle to attract attention, Mifune grabs it and throws it into the water. Just why he does this is unclear. Eventually the raft drifts to some islands and upon coming ashore the two discover what seems to be a large abandoned military fortified gun emplacement. There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese. Marvin repeatedly cries out ""Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!"" Mifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims ""Oh I thought you were a Japanese!"" The point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.  It becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.  Another weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God. Marvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful. Nor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear. Then the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more. Then, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.  Many will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement. I must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse. You may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.  WARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes. You will be MAJORLY disappointed!  I enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie. Does it all count for nothing? I wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform? I believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long. It too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.  Four stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.)

Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese ""star"" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?

It was 100% pure fun and by far his most 'accessible' film for all audiences.  You will note that it had aspects of Saturday Night live and much of the comedy that we're used to.  Note that this was long before SNL and spinoffs like Animal House or Trading Places.  Woody invented some of this humor. The plot is straightfoward: Woody Allen plays a chronically challenged underachiever(as always) with a long-suffering girlfriend/spouse.  He finally holds up a bank and does it in the way only Woody could.  The sight gags, blackout sketches, and double-entendre(inside jokes) are relentless and great.

Is it his piercing blue eyes, or the sense that, no matter how inscrutable his expression, there's so much more going on inside his head that we're not privy to? Green is in no way what one might consider a Hollywood-type leading man--he appears small, his hairline is receding, and he's not conventionally handsome--but the man commands the screen like nobody's business. I found ""Touching Evil"" to be a fantastic series, so when ""TE 2"" became available, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, it took me some time to watch all the episodes. Perhaps this was because I was so impressed with the first series that I had high expectations. Maybe it was ""sophomore slump."" Ah, it was probably that the story arc of the first series was just plain more interesting. It is often the case that when the original creators of a series relinquish creative control to others, the quality suffers. This is also true of ""TE 2,"" which sometimes seems like a pale reflection of the original. What it still has going for it, however, is the characters. I very much appreciate the circularity of the stories, bringing characters--like Creegan's wife and kids--in and out of the story at various points throughout the series. Shaun Dingwall alternately impresses and annoys with his portrayal of the unsteady DI Rivers, and Nicola Walker--another unconventional look but undeniably powerful--just knocks my socks off when she takes Creegan to task every so often. Maybe that's the key to why I enjoy the world of ""Touching Evil"" so much: It feels like family. And although I would love to see Robson Green in more visible projects, I sort of hope Hollywood never finds out about him.

I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.  It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.  I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie. The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.  There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.  My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.  Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting.

Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water. The tensions, very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out each other might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three. Mifune shows his tenderness first. But both play outstanding roles. While trying to develop the peace, Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy.  Their keen attention to the nonverbals, even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererested in interpersonal communication.  Marvin brings in new vitality once he recognizes there is bamboo on the island.  Yielding to each other in a collaborative manner, the raft is built and launched.  Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days. Both are exhausted. Discovering the new island is a dream, that neither perhaps thought would occur.  They forage through the deserted military hospital, each finding things of special interest  and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each other countlessly with a big bottle of booze.

After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.

Neil Simon will make the list, along with Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen. There are others, of course. Together they make up one of the most remarkable flowerings of comic talent in American history. Woody's talent sprang from him fully formed. His basic gift is in full evidence in this early picture. It is debatable that he has improved with age, although it is worth noting that his exposure, like Harold Pinter's, to elegant, bourgeois life permanently altered the objects of his comic study. Mia Farrow introduced him to the good life, to aristocratic penthouse life, and there was no turning back. Still, his genius can be seen in his ability to adjust and move on. Later Woody is every bit as good as his early work, but not necessarily better, unless you happen to like posh talk and that very special boredom of the urban bourgeoisie.

The world has become so much cruder and the language so much more coarse that this feels much like a family film today.  It is funny, yes, but some of it feels dated.  Comedy is often tied to its time and doesn't travel to a later time so well.  Yet, much of the movie remains terrific and classic.  There are many lines that have become part of the language (""it is if you're doing it right"", for example).  Just go up to anyone who knows the film and say ""abt natural"" or ""I have a gub"" and they will likely begin to chuckle.  And, of course, there is the soap and shoe polish gun in the rain.  It is also nice to see Janet Margolin in one of her best roles as the female lead, Louise, Virgil's eternally loyal girlfriend.  She was taken far too young by ovarian cancer, but this role is a great one to remember her by.  For those who haven't seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That's Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.  That mix of self-awareness and yet being completely unaware is the source of much of the humor.  It really does work and is quite funny.

This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.  Lacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.  Of less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes.

The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.  2.

Marold,"`Take the Money and Run' is the very first movie where Woody Allen is writer, director, and star, and true to the first film in any artist's series of work, it may be the his best up to `Annie Hall', his seventh film as writer/director/star and arguably his very best comedy. `Love and Death' and `Bananas' may a little weak. `Play It Again, Sam' has the first writing and direction where the audience develops some empathy with the characters, so it presages the more serious business of the later films. But `Take the Money and Run' is simply nonstop silliness, with some of the longest and best running gags this side of Mel Brooks.  Even this very first movie has many of Allen's trademarks. For a relatively low budget movie, the quality of the music is very, very good, with original pieces contributed by the up and coming Marvin Hamlisch. Even though the supporting cast is not filled with a lot of highly recognizable actors, most of the faces such as the chain gang supervisor all seem to have a vaguely familiar look about them. Allen's female lead is Janet Margolin, for whom this is probably the highlight of her career. His `Bananas' costar, Louise Lasser, later of `Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' appears in a very small role.  Two other trademark motifs are the flashbacks to boyhood and the cut-aways to interviews with the principle character's parents. These devices appear in `Annie Hall' and even in the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors' plus several other films.  Another typical aspect of this movie is that it is a parody of documentaries, although not with such loving artfulness as Allen does in `Zelig'.  One thing that is entirely absent is any intellectuality. I can't recall any joke for which you need to read a Russian novel or see a classic silent movie to understand. While it strikes me that poor Virgil Starkwell does have some mock heroic aspects which may have been borrowed from `Don Quixote' or `Candide', I think that may be my seeing things of which Allen had no inkling.  Allen has claimed, contrary to a lot of other artists' statements, that comedy is easy. Allen is so adept in this movie at spinning off high quality jokes at such a rate that he genuinely makes it seem effortless. And yet, like the proverbial Chinese meal, you leave this movie and an hour later, you are `still hungry'. That is, you take away no warm feelings for any characters and their situations or any satisfaction that a hero succeeded in a quest or a heavy got their just deserts.  Some movies have compared Allen's work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can't hold a candle to Fields' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.  My primary recommendation for people who may like some but not all of Allen's films, this one should definitely be in your collection, whether you just like his `early, funny' movies or prefer all his styles, but want to skip over some of the darker, less well written, or less interesting works.",First triple threat from the Woodman.

Take the Money And Run was Woody Allen's first real film to direct himself and it remains one of his funniest.  Disguised as a documentary, this 1969 film tells the hilarious story of Virgil Starkweather, the world's most inept (if stupidly optomistic) thief.  Like most of Woody Allen's early films, everything is played almost solely for the laughs it might provide and nearly forty years later, it all holds up very well.  Lots of hilarious stuff in here (at times, this film is the funniest Mel Brooks film that Mel Brooks never made) but my personal favorite bits would have to include: Virgil's parents who disguise their indentities by wearing Groucho Marx glasses but will be familiar to anyone whose seen any of Allen's films, Virgil's attempt to rob a bank is foiled when none of the clerks can read his bad handwriting, another robbery goes wrong when a rival gang decides to rob the same bank at the same time, Virgil's attempt to escape from prison by making a fake gun out of soap is ruined when it starts to rain, the sight of Woody Allen on a southern chain gang (and being punished by being locked in the hole with an insurance salesman), and especially the scene where a man Virgil attempts to mug turns out to be not only a childhood school friend but an undercover cop as well.  Directing with a wild-anything-goes-spirit, Woody Allen gives one of his first (and best) ""born loser"" performances as Virgil.  Amongst all the madness, the film also presents a bizarrely sweet love story between Virgil and his wife, who is well-played by the lovely (and the sadly no longer with us) Janet Margolin.  Always underappreciated, Margolin was one of those forgotten, at times almost painfully vulnerable actresses that one can't help but fall in love with everytime she appears on screen. Though overshadowed by the later Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Janet Margolin was Woody Allen's first unlikely love interest (in both film and briefly real life) and they have a strong chemistry together that adds much heart to a wild film.

Its only real value is as a curiosity. This is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right. The mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"". Not till ""Love and Death"" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody. While most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying ""Get to the point"" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time. This film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on ""Take the Money and Run"", you won't be missing too much.","In the beginning, Woody created a schlock mockumentary",997660800,4.0,,power stick much tugging chair find genre somewhat way nicely allen serf i.e value prefer oeuvre say glass substantive uneven think moment others time bananas nebbishy cello template get hilarious strong repeatedly verbal take definitely ramble disappointed feel till later feel real laughter movie money fiction path obviously knock camera physical well-meaning float mockumentary mannered serve stomp foot one parody death part love flatter sparkle miss term back right subject choose try march point utilize favourite beautiful try satire woody's documentary gamely truly chooses curiosity first list establish time humour get juvenile would dubious familiar gag employ authority interview sleeper work woody dexterous loser band rest lead effective form bottom girlfriend entertain send out chosen make scene gag either impossibly narrative film moment run subsequent pas style sight saw failure conduct story yet along acquires though run keep behind proto-woody figure force parody flat occupation tone joke wit allen's late may personal keep rather film

As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others.  The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, the suffragette movement, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.  The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).  I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Four is as interesting as the previous three seasons - the writing is always great, and the ensemble cast continues to amaze with their wonderful acting talents.  This fourth season of the show sees WW I in full swing - James Bellamy returns from the front for a break and finds himself consigned to a desk job (even though he still travels), something which sits very badly with a man who yearns to join his regiment in the thick of battle; Hazel and James' marriage is not altogether happy, a recurring theme from the later part of Season Three, but the war has sort of masked their marital difficulties; footman Edward marries his sweetheart, parlour maid Daisy, and also goes off to war; many from below stairs contribute what they can to the war effort - kitchen maid Ruby goes off to work in a munitions factory, Rose works part-time as a tram conductor, and butler Hudson works part-time in the constabulary. Mr. Bellamy, Sr. gets offered a key government post and ward Georgina tries her hand at nursing.  As much as I love Downton Abbey, I felt that this season of Upstairs, Downstairs credibly explored all the complexities of WW I - focusing more on the personal lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place and how the war affects them all in terms of relationships, duties, and sacrifices. This is one of the best British period dramas I've ever watched, and that's saying a lot given the vast number of BBC period dramas I've amassed over the years.

This fourth season of the show sees WW I in full swing - James Bellamy returns from the front for a break and finds himself consigned to a desk job (even though he still travels), something which sits very badly with a man who yearns to join his regiment in the thick of battle; Hazel and James' marriage is not altogether happy, a recurring theme from the later part of Season Three, but the war has sort of masked their marital difficulties; footman Edward marries his sweetheart, parlour maid Daisy, and also goes off to war; many from below stairs contribute what they can to the war effort - kitchen maid Ruby goes off to work in a munitions factory, Rose works part-time as a tram conductor, and butler Hudson works part-time in the constabulary. Mr. Bellamy, Sr. gets offered a key government post and ward Georgina tries her hand at nursing.  As much as I love Downton Abbey, I felt that this season of Upstairs, Downstairs credibly explored all the complexities of WW I - focusing more on the personal lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place and how the war affects them all in terms of relationships, duties, and sacrifices.

After watching the first season of Upstairs, Downstairs via Amazon Instant Download (free for Prime members), I was so captivated by this well-written and credibly acted series that I purchased the rest of the series (via instant download) and have been enjoying the show since (except for Season 5 which is sadly not available via streaming).  This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.  The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, the suffragette movement, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.  The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).

For one thing, I'd never have been able to get through nursing school taking time to watch TV, and for another I'd never have lived through waiting for the next episode.  I'm way too much of an immediate needs gratification sort of person!!  The setting is a period to which I have become more and more attracted, the two decades between World War I and World War II.  Times are changing, but not necessarily for the better, or at least not for everyone.  The old guard is losing its hold over society, but those newly rising to power are not necessarily better than those who wielded it before.  If anything the old guard, based as it was on a landed aristocracy with a vested interest in England as a property, had reasons to keep things from falling totally apart for the middle and lower classes.  Their pride of place came as much from their perceived obligations as from their assets.  The rising nouveaux riche are vested in money alone, a portable commodity that can be invested wherever there is profit to be had.  Their focus is on who has the most of it; without ties to anything, they take no responsibility for the society that makes their fortunes.  Theirs were the ideals upon which our present world and its predicaments are based.  The characters of the series are reflections of the changing times.  The Upstairs family sees the pater familias, an aristocratic man of conservative principles, losing ground to the younger members of the family who are going through the emotional ravages of World War I.  They question everything and challenge many of the basic principles of social behavior, including the roles of women, political power and who should wield it, and the behavior of society during war.  Below stairs, too, there is disruption.  The younger generation questions the reasons for the demand for ""gratitude"" for their position of servitude and see the efforts of the butler to prevent their adopting new ideals as repressive and patronizing.  They question the need to ask the family they serve for permission to marry, to hold a war job, to question their additional work load without commensurate compensation.  Upstairs Downstairs is a world in flux, much like our own, and the efforts of the extended family to adjust to it are absolutely mesmerizing.",Mesmerizing,1282003200,,,riche upstairs member power nouveaux captivate woman land conservative much reflection mesmerize person additional prevent demand work character newly way like come butler responsibility wield glad load attract interest need take world permission question downstairs job time hold next war everyone apart asset least adopt get property fall many invested thing england i'd class generation take reason lose familias aristocratic totally pater immediate money pride well wherever role middle patronize tie fortune thing decade behavior upon wield position one ravage aristocracy series new wait principle place commodity society predicament ideal servitude nurse ii able go see set necessarily gratitude question compensation stair marry profit become obligation effort school alone watch time sort focus flux present live everything commensurate challenge amazingly see young period guard ground vest tv disruption man never extend need i'm social serve two episode old without repressive emotional include make gratification basic political ask adjust rise base another anything change low keep family absolutely portable perceive

He has stolen control of a satellite that allows him to control the weather everywhere on the planet. He is holding the world hostage and has a hefty ransom. So British super agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is called into action to stop him, and he is first advised to bring in Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a noble prize winning physicist and the number one suspected ally of DeWynter after video footage of her surfaces implicating her in the murder of a high ranking member of the British business community. After he brings her in to meet Mother and Father, they determine she is innocent. But if so, then who is the woman on the video? They decide to team up to get some answers, and start at the home of Sir August DeWynter, where they quickly discover who their enemy is. But he is ready for their every move, and has them both at his mercy in a hurry. But they also soon discover he has a friend on the inside who gave him vital information to help him steal the weather satellite. A mole in British Intelligence. But who?

The plotlines and stories seem a bit shop-worn and many episodes near the end of the run  just trail off without any big topper or clear resolution.  Finally, and most unforgivable, Bob seems to be literally phoning in his appearances to the point of hardly even showing up in many episodes.

Baldwin,"In the Nineties it was fashionable for Hollywood to adapt popular television series for the big screen the best being ""The Fugitive"" and the very worst, in my mind, ""Lost In Space"".  There were high hopes riding on ""The Avengers"" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited ""The Avengers"" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.

First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.

That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way ""Toys"" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.  Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named ""Evil Peel,"" and gets to say the line, ""You just saved me from myself."" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the ""funnier"" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!  It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers.

Unfortunately, a lot of scenes which were in the trailer were deleted from the film after what are rumored to be terrible test screenings, and in the end, we wind up with what looks like an action movie trailer for the real thing (please excuse me for using Ridley Scott's descrption of his own film ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" when talking about the Director's Cut). The original length of the movie is rumored to run aywhere from 115 minutes to 2/1/2 hours. Frankly, I LOVED the movie, but am left feeling cheated because the Director's Cut has not been released. Warner Bros. should plan to release it, as there is a fan base, however small, for this movie. Also, there's a narrative error caused by the editing down to 86-89 minutes-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-when infiltrating Sir August De Wynter's lair, how did the real Doctor Peel know the code words (""How now, brown cow?"") to get into the lair with John Steed, as the line is not heard in the film prior to the scene?-SPOILER OVER!!! I enjoyed the acting of everyone involved, but felt that Sean Connery was underused (and, judging by the trailer and information on another site, most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor). SPOILER ALERT!!! Patrick Macnee's cameo was good. I guess the reason he chose not to appear on screen (and why Ms. Rigg turned down a cameo in the film) is because they didn't want the cameos to distract the audience from the plot of the movie. It also would have been nice to see Honor Blackman, another Bond Girl, appear in the film as well. Trivia: Patrick Macnee also appeared in a Bond film: ""A View To A Kill.""

I suspect one reason there was a negative reaction to this film was because many people missed the original series. The original series was before my time, so I had nothing to miss so to speak.  Moving on, the movie tries to create a 60s feeling, and to a great deal they succeed. We see John Steed gradually walk through a series of 'obstacles' to test his spy abilities. Uma Thurman and John Steed meet, and right away, we see that Uma Thurman does not always play by the established rules. We are lead to believe that Uma Thurman has sabotaged her own project, and of course we know that that is a little too obvious. So, Mrs Peel and John end up working together to find the real problem.  We then meet Sean Connery who carries some charm and is obviously very intelligent. But he shows his dark side as well. Moving on, we see that Connery's plan is to control the world with his weather controlling device. (Alright. A bit cliche. But this is a 60s recreation, so a bit of the cliche was probably inevitable.) Also worth mentioning is that all the nations of the government are fighting and bickering at the crucial moment and accomplishing nothing. Sean Connery walks in and announces his intentions to control the world. And of course they continue to argue and bicker uselessly. There is something utterly hilarious about how Sean Connery silences the politicians very simply: ""Oh...DO SHUT UP!""  I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But there is a nice 60s charm; there is the right amount of action; the right amount of story; and a nice amount of internal trouble where we should feel safe; and the comedy is well balanced too. And the final showdown between John Steed and Sean Connery is very well done. Also worth mentioning is that John Steed and Mrs Peel work together well without stomping over each other.  Another character I feel obliged to mention is 'Mother.' Rather than being the cliche behind the scenes man, he seems to know that things aren't always what they seem; he is open to reason and the finding of the truth; and when he discovers the truth, he tries to save Mrs. Peel, even though he is old and injured. It's also worth mentioning that at one point he refuses to believe that Steed and Peel have simply vanished, and he sends out a rescue party. (The kind, benevolent, open to reason boss, who knows when he has to face the danger. And just the right touch of being fatherly.)  If you are expecting the original series, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you are willing to see this in its own light, it's really a nice film.

1402,1402,3,False,"01 24, 2009",A220FJEQNGMSRN,0767015525,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Trevor Willsmer,"In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.  Warner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)  The loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.  On the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.  Sadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.  There's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat.

1403,1403,5,True,"09 23, 2008",A1BA72K4VK1UN1,0767015525,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Patrick W. Crabtree,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:  1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).  2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.  3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).  This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 4"" color-coded RED), is the fourth of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.  Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.  Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.  Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.  In the 1968 Set No. 4 (which includes Vols. 7 and 8), we're talking about seven very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:  Volume 7:  ""Wish You Were Here"" - In a parody of ""The Prisoner"" Tara attempts to free her uncle from a hotel which has a firm ""no check-out early"" policy. This is a superb episode.  ""Stay Tuned"" - Investigating Steed's amnesia (a returning theme from previous years), Steed and Tara uncover a plot to kill their boss, ""Mother"".  ""Take Me To Your Leader"" - A briefcase stuffed with money and a bomb seems to have a mind of its own - and it's giving strange orders.  Volume 8:  ""Fog"" - When foreign committee members arrive in London for a meeting, they find themselves stalked by the ""Gaslight Ghoul,"" a Victorian killer with a modern motive.  ""Homicide and Old Lace"" - On his birthday, Mother tells tales of an older adventure. The flashback scenes were originally filmed for the never-aired episode, ""The Great Britain Crime"".  ""Love All"" - The missile department is leaking secrets but Steed and Tara sniff out the source of the indiscretion. A terrific episode.  ""Get-A-Way"" - A prison is having trouble holding enemy agents. The first two escapees knock off Steed's pals... is he the next on the list?  The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.  The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.  I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon.

I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......  On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.  In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.  The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.  After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.  A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.  There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.  I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.  The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.  The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.  Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).  I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.  (On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)

Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....  The story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.  What follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!  The cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C.

1435,1435,1,False,"07 24, 2004",A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,0767015525,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Duane Thomas,"To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.  When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.  To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.  The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.  So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.  The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.  There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.","Great TV Show, Lousy Movie",1090627200,18.0,,conservative force maybe dress dislike come understand ever fight rock powerful traditional thurman culture young time informed get iq many thing fortunate portrayed reason make different totally roles fortunately demanded appeal original suit youth soon conflict type britain translate macnee/diana bit ralph almost government would heart thoughtful particularly outspoken everything miscast fiennes he'd believable become tv reactionary relationship the-way-things-are-and-should-be special saw devote two endless ex-military uma example british drove every actress give television duty episodes hard attitude interview person peel none enjoy like peel's woman value nowhere could four character destroy toward doctorates can't aggressive several immense within possess problem drink embodiment genius intellectual rigg's sex love new future individuality make whole forever prop umbrella similarly perfectly moviemakers first time exist live imagine hidebound zip sexually buy rock-ribbed diana anyway bear accomplish proper see former year fashion human miss choice pas norm masculinity failure masterstroke doubt though sacred lipped respect partner right intelligent he's horribly hold code latter thurman's contemporary play long order coquettish fail john simply among thespic catsuit successful convention lead important upper anyone poor eventually hat steed's she'd must fan well-established found redefine music emma dynamic embrace accoutrement shakespearean movement offer series entire represent try sexual sense birth good use whether turkey mind exceedingly exemplar check introduce authority steed/emma aware man rigg despise watch hat debate long-accepted middle-aged stuffy hideously along whichever life dear stiff well housewifedom strong argue look noble profoundly unheard look defy demand somewhat mod require movie milieu surface doctor world action portray high-level subtext discuss tea original macnee something great multiple already real threaten source exist provocative that's play honor mark three-piece historical perspective platonic reason women's go necessarily work threaten truly sweep prime want skill learn meeting steed/peel sort lifetime crust patrick bowler knight even convincingly else cast opinion steed irreverent avenger provoke class say social evidence people show polish

The first thing which struck me was the spontaneity with which Mr. Taylor was shown creating one of his new works.  Standing side-by-side with one of his dancers, the two just ... moved ... and then conjectured about what might go next:  ""you could start this way ... and then, maybe ...""  Very interesting.  While there is a generous offering of studio footage, the recurring stereotype of the intensely driven dancemaster imploring his subjects to understand the gravity of his holy creation (you've seen this in movies) does not exist in this film.  No cinematic exaggeration here:  it's just the truest depiction of what happens as dance is created.  In reality, the emotion and interaction between Mr. Taylor and his dancers is often more characteristic of a family than of a teacher/student relationship. Aside from following people around, Mr. Diamond's camera gets to many places I've never seen before.  I loved the views from the wings in the opening sequence (""Esplanade""), and also during the performance in India when the sound system went dead and the crew was trying not to be frantic during the silence (the dancers continued on without missing a step until the sound was restored!).  I also got a kick out of the dancer in his hotel room explaining what he had to go through to wake up after a night of performing. The film highlights two dance pieces, ""Aureole"" and ""Piazzolla Caldera,"" and even though they aren't seen in their entirety, there is no diminishment in their strength and beauty.  Mr. Diamond, who has also directed episodes of PBS's ""Great Performances,"" was adept at interspersing the contrasting performance film (color) with studio footage (black and white) so that the two meshed perfectly.  The editing during the dance numbers was the best I've ever seen, incorporating both the more typical audience vantage point with the more dramatic on-stage perspective from amongst the dancers.  The proximity and the viewing angles were stunning; a wonderful surprise.  There's also a fair amount of footage from the Paul Taylor Dance Archives, showing a younger Mr. Taylor and company performing signature works. In maintaining the foundation of a storyline, the film incorporates a biographical aspect, showing the evolution of Mr. Taylor's role as a dancemaker as an outgrowth of his boyhood years.  The interviews with his long-time friends and associates, as well as the words of Mr. Taylor himself, are proof of the depth and seriousness with which he reveres his art.  The film also touches on the troubling business realities that weigh on dance companies:  having to remain financially solvent, and dealing with the picket lines which materialized in New York after the company hired non-union musicians.  There's even a scene involving the firing of one of his dancers (""I just didn't want to work with her""), a somber sequence of dialogues, but one which lends strength to the reality of this film. As far as DVD features go, nothing extraordinary, but lots to read about the ""inspirations and interpretations"" behind the dances, biographies of selected dancers, and a scrolling list of the company's complete repertory (through 1999). Overall, this film's portrayal of the ways in which modern dance is created and portrayed make this a DVD I'd recommend to anyone.

And of the small, not-for-profit arts institution in America. From beginning to end the viewer gets a glimpse of what it takes for such an institution to survive and remain creative in an environment that doesn't always appreciate innovation and creativity. Director Matthew Diamond (himself a former dancer and choreographer) has done an excellent job of interweaving rehearsal and live performances with archival footage and talking heads (dance critics, administrative staff, technical crew, dancers, former dancers, and Taylor himself all get their say). Taylor comes across, in turns, as impish (fabricating stories to please the press), vague (struggling to communicate new steps to his dancers), nervous (constantly chewing gum), fearful (""my inspiration comes from fear""), and autocratic (in the course of the film he fires one of his dancers). But most of all, Taylor comes across as insecure and vulnerable. One especially telling moment in the film comes when the company is performing in India and the sound system fails. The dancers continue dancing in silence while the crew busies itself trying to fix the problem. The music comes back on and the company is in perfect sync. Taylor revealingly says, ""My dance was ruined. And they were the heroes, not me. They stole the show."" As one former company member put it when describing Taylor's origins: ""There was [Martha] Graham and then there was this big dysfunctional family, and Paul Taylor was one of them....And they all brought their own dysfunction to their own companies."" The director should be applauded for the way he avoided dance cliches and dull, straight-on filming of dance performances. Especially exciting was the from-the-wings view of the energetic ""Esplanade"" that opens the film. And the most entrancing sequence is the male solo from ""Aureole."" For this, Diamond has intercut a current rehearsal of Patrick Corbin learning the dance with three different archival versions of Taylor performing the same work. The music continues seamlessly as the visuals switch from one point in time to another, suggesting without preaching, that dances have a life of their own...and a good one has a chance of outlasting any of its interpreters.

I will admit that I think the film could've been a little better in parts, I have a feeling that there are many deleted scenes from this film, and this is something that is simply begging for a Director's Cut Special Edition. Anyway, I think Ralph Fiennes does an exceptional job in the role of John Steed in that he combines the darker parts of who Steed was when the show started with Ian Hendry, with the charm, wit and sophistication on display during the Diana Rigg era.  Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat. Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent. I think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball.

Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian. But the movie is incomprehensible.

I much preferred this movie to most of the James Bond movies. For one, the wit is wicked, Uma Thurman (Mrs. Peel) was born to wear a catsuit and Ralph Fiennes is a most dapper John Steed. This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.  While drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:  ""After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.""  Then, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.  So, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter.

Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as ""Mother"" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous ""Father"" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.  Director Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar. Sources close to the film say that it would clarify a number of points including the two Mrs Peels. Perhaps we will see it in a future reissue. So for the meantime put away your preconceived baggage and try and take the film on its own terms and you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. After all seeing is believing.

Beusch,"I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud. I am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this ""film"" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time. What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit). The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series. Do yourself a favor.

Therefore, I have no problems with the earlier releases of the first four seasons of the show.  In addition, although the video quality isn't of high-definition quality, the episodes are eminently watchable.  All problematic issues were soon forgotten after I started watching the show.  Bob Newhart was one of the first successful stand-up comedians to star in a TV sitcom.  That started a trend that continued with Tim Allen, Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld, and many others.  In addition, the show was not cancelled by CBS because of poor ratings.  After six successful seasons, Bob decided that is was time to end the series.  The writing on the show perfectly suited Bob's personality and comedic style.  The casting choices were uniformly excellent, especially with Suzanne Pleshette as Bob's wife Emily.  Special mention must be made of Jack Riley as Bob's patient Elliot Carlin, who appeared in 56 of the 142 episodes.  To say that he is an unforgettable character is an understatement.  The box set also includes an informative booklet, which gives a brief synopsis of each episode, along with its original airdate.  What really makes this box set special are the bonus features.  Audio commentary is provided on several episodes.  The bonus disc includes the original, unaired pilot.  In it, Peter Bonerz plays Dr. Jerry Robinson as another psychologist, instead of an orthodontist.  Marcia Wallace does not appear as secretary Carol Kester, nor does Bill Daily appear as nutty navigator and neighbor Howard Borden.  The 19th Anniversary special is also included.  It takes place on the day after Bob had a dream about being a Vermont innkeeper named Dick Loudon.  The most surreal moment of the special is when they show a clip of Bill Daily as Major Roger Healey on the ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" TV series.  The bonus disc also includes ""Group Therapy,"" which was recorded in Los Angeles in December of 2013.  It's a nostalgic discussion of the show with Bob Newhart, Peter Bonerz, Bill Daily, Jack Riley, and director Michael Zinberg.  Sadly, Suzanne Pleshette and Marcia Wallace had both passed away, and are sorely missed in the discussion group.  Bob and Bill do show their age, while Peter has held up well.  Sadly, Jack Riley had a stroke, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair.  This look back to when they were all in their prime is bittersweet, as time has taken its toll on all of the participants.

He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque? This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into.

The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating. The main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either. By contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public. (DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.

I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.  Perhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (""Bum Voyage"" and ""Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?"") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.  However, the ""Complete Series"" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.  Another difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible.

Life is too short, I'm not going to let something this insignificant keep me from viewing clean, unedited versions of my favorite series of all time.

The audio is great, much cleaner than my recorded set which had a lot of hissing.  It is perfect for a 70's sitcom, I give the audio a 9.5 out of 10.

1510,1510,5,False,"04 19, 2014",A413ABZIU3RBS,0767001311,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Robert J. Keil,"Looks like I'm the first reviewer to have actually received and viewed (at least in part) this set, having pre-ordered it from Shout who delivered it five weeks before the official release date.  BACKGROUND: The Bob Newhart Show is my favorite show in the history of television. I've bought every VHS and DVD release available over the years, and have been making recordings off the air for 20 years in an effort to collect (and then ""upgrade"" the quality of) all the episodes in this series. My expectations for this set are high since the show deserves the best DVD release possible. Fox released the first four seasons in 2005 and 2006, only to leave fans hanging for 8 years for the last two seasons. Luckily, Shout Factory took the opportunity to release the Bob Newhart Show the way it should have been from the beginning - as a complete series set. Yes, this means hardcore fans like me have DVDs, VHS tapes, and old DVD-R recordings that we don't need anymore. So sell the old ones or give them away. To me it's a small price to pay to get this set.  THE SHOW ITSELF: Not much to say other than what you likely already know - The Bob Newhart Show is generally regarded as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Its rare combination of amazing writing, a top-notch cast, and a style of humor that is at once accessible and sophisticated, is a high water mark in the history of television.  PACKAGING: The set comes in a standard height box with 3 Amaray-style cases that holds 6 discs apiece. Gone are the two-sided Fox discs with cheesy cartoon-themed menus. Here, discs for Seasons 1 and 2 are in one case, seasons 3 and 4 in a second case and seasons 5 and 6 are in the third case. These are NOT stacked on a spindle and thus are easily accessible. The disc faces feature nice 1970s-inspired artwork across all discs with color variations for each case. The fourth (bonus disc) case is a standard height but slim. The menus for each disc are based on the look of Bob's office door. Everything is classy and everything matches.  AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY: The Bob Newhart Show has always had quality issues on broadcast and video release as far back as I remember, and sadly this release is no exception. Over the years I've assumed that the transfers we've seen are taken from either second-generation prints, 16mm dupes, or analog-sharpened film-to-tape transfers. Other sitcoms shot on film in this era look better. If anybody has inside information on the condition of the original or edited film elements I'd love to know the story. So generally the contrast on most episodes it too high and harsh looking, there is a lot of grain, and most episodes are pretty de-saturated and the color temperature is too magenta in my opinion. Sound is also a bit harsh and thin in most episodes. My guess is that Shout has used the best original material available, and I have certainly never seen this series look or sound better than it does in this DVD set. So it's just decent, and probably limited to being so just by the nature of the source material.  EXTRAS: Every episode I've watched so far is uncut and runs about 25 minutes. Shout appears to have carried over the commentary tracks from the Fox discs. The 40-page booklet is very nicely designed, well written by sitcom expert Vince Waldron, and organized so you can find the episode titles, plot summaries, and airdates easily. The 19th Anniversary reunion show from 1991 is a 1-hour ""clip show"" that is just okay. It's nice to see the actors again, but not much actually happens other than setting up the clips which are (by themselves) great. The ""Group Therapy"" extra is a sit-down studio conversation with cast and crew that is very entertaining and insightful and lasts most of an hour. The unaired pilot is a real treat, and is quite different from the show as we would know it later.  CONCLUSION: It great to finally see this show get the treatment it deserves with this Complete Series DVD release. The packaging, tasteful and consistent menus and disc artwork, full-length episodes, and extras are a fitting presentation. Other than some picture and sound quality issues that are probably inherent in the source material, there's little room for improvement in this set. Unless somebody finds some ""lost"" negatives or higher-quality masters in a vault or basement somewhere and makes a high-def blu-ray transfer of them, this is probably the best presentation of the Bob Newhart Show we will ever get. Overall well worth the money and a set to be re-watched for many years to come.

It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series. I'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then. The time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve. Still, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun.

To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.  Alas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.  But what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a ""What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?"" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out ""That's right leave, its just like you."" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed ""kissing"" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)  But there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch.

Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:  1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).  2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.  3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).  This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 2"" color-coded ORANGE), is the second of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.  Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.  Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.  Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.  In the 1968 Set No. 2 (which includes Vols. 3 and 4), we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:  Volume 3:  ""All Done With Mirrors"" - Steed is under house arrest (a theme we've seen before!) while Tara plugs the leaks at a classified facility that hasn't been keeping its secrets.  ""Legacy of Death"" - The inheritance of a dagger turns into a truly double-edged gift and bodies pile up in Steed's drawing room.  ""Noon Doomsday"" - Steed is trapped in a convalescent home by an old adversary who has a flair for drama and a thirst for vengeance.  Volume 4:  ""Look (Stop Me If You've Heard this One)... But There Were These Two Fellers"" - John Cleese guest stars as Steed and Tara face down a band of killer clowns determined to save their rest home from destruction.  ""Have Guns... Will Haggle"" - Tara's on the hot seat when Black Market rifle brokers choose her for a product demonstration!  ""They Keep Killing Steed"" - A plot to infiltrate and subvert a peace conference hinges on the creation of an exact double of Steed (yet another familiar theme!)  The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.  The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.  I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon.

1563,1563,5,True,"05 25, 2008",A1BA72K4VK1UN1,0767018699,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Patrick W. Crabtree,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement!  This DVD package (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in a box, this ""Set No 2"" color-coded ORANGE) is ONE of FOUR sets for the 1967 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.  1967 was Diana Rigg's last full season as Steed's partner. Her career really launched in 1965 from this fine series in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, who was shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until many years later.  Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish.  Each 52-minute episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from an airborne costume party to a man (actually, an androidish double of a man), who cannot be killed by traditional means.  Here, we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:  ""The Living Dead"" -- A group of men are lost in a disastrous mine collapse, including the local squire. Afterward, a local hermit spots ""the ghost"" of this man, the ""dead"" Duke of Benedict, (as opposed to his wimpy succeeder), near a spooky cemetery chapel. Steed and Mrs. Peel investigate and they discover an ""underground city"" where an army of pseudo-evil-German-types is being built up to take over Great Britain! A superior episode.  ""The Hidden Tiger"" - A butler is ripped to shreds in an English manor house. Nearby is an agricultural research station which falls under the suspicion of Steed and Mrs. Peel. After more maulings (deaths), it becomes clear that a devious Sussex organization, P.U.R.R.R., (!!!) is linked to the killings - all the victims seem to be on the organization's board of directors.  ""The Correct Way to Kill"" - Russian espionage agents are being killed off in England... but not by the English agents. Steed and Mrs. Peel pair off with their Russian counterparts to catch the murderer. This episode is a lot of fun.  ""Never, Never Say Die"" - A man is accidentally run down by a car and killed... but then he ""escapes"" off the exam table when the doc isn't watching! Steed and Mrs. Peel really get suspicious when he is killed a second time, by the same means, and later shows up causing a LOT of trouble. This macho guy also seems much affected by radio waves which leads The Avengers to discover that the man is an android and that more such android ""doubles"" of important people are infesting the local community. The bonus of this episode is that it stars the great Christopher Lee!  ""Epic"" -- Mrs. Peel is kidnapped and taken to Schneer Studios where she is forced to make a movie about her own murder; however, the killers are mostly incompetent. This is a funny one.  ""The Superlative Seven"" - Steed attends a high-end costume party that is conducted in an aircraft bound for... ??????  It's quickly discovered that all the invited guests are athletes of sorts and that they will be utilized to test a new and improved superman. Mrs. Peel flies to the dangerous and isolated island stronghold to attempt Steed's rescue. A very fun romp of an episode.  The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity... in fact, it actually went ""sci-fi"" in some episodes. This did not diminish my love for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for these changes and actualities.  The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.  I'll be reviewing all of the 1967 ""sets,"" (as I mentioned earlier, there are four in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), over the next few days so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon.

Steed and Peel have to ascertain why these important British officials continue to challenge suicide -- and some succeed! Written by Roger Marshall.  ""A Touch of Brimstone"" -- This one was banned from American television because Emma Peel dons high-laced boots, a spiked dog collar and a very skimpy outfit! Here, we have The Hellfire Club, hoaxsters, and murder! Written by Brian Clemens.  ""A Sense of History"" -- It's a battle over economic theory, by medieval Robin Hood types. But these denizens of the woods (and a college campus) don't mind killing those who disagree with their views. This is a superb episode. Written by Martin Woodhouse.  ""How to Succeed... at Murder"" -- Business executives are being knocked off... by their feminist secretaries?!? The trail leads Steed and Mrs. Peel to an elite perfumery but the ring leader is quite elusive. Written by Brian Clemens.  ""Honey for the Prince"" -- A Middle-eastern prince on a diplomatic mission is the target for assassination. Steed and Mrs. Peel intervene.

Steed must take on the disguise of a student butler to resolve the mystery. Written by Brian Clemens.  ""The House That Jack Built"" -- Here, we have a psychological thriller. Mrs. Peel inherits an estate from her ""Uncle Jack,"" and is subsequently  trapped inside a carnivalistic madhouse. Steed rushes to the rescue. This is a great one. Written by Brian Clemens.

The tapes are not copy-protected.  There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when ""The Avengers"" got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time.

Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time.  Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns.  Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.

Being able to film in lower light, permits those deep shadows, giving a sinister touch.  1) ""The Murder Market"" takes Steed and Emma undercover at a marriage bureau, ending with Steed rescuing Emma from being buried alive as she gets too close to the ""black widows"" at the center of this evil plot 2) ""A Surfeit of H20"" A freak rainstorm drowns locals in the fields.  Fearing this is the return of the ""Great Flood"", they villagers have begun building a new Ark.  Emma is stylish even in a Mac! 3) ""The Hour That Never Was"" Steed visits his old RAF airbase in Hamlin. Hours are missing in people's memories, so Steed and Emma must uncover brainwashing saboteurs, threatening England. 4) ""Dial a Deadly Number"" have Steed and Emma investigating a device called a ""Bleeper"".  The Bleeper is designed to help millionaires keep in touch, but an evil doer has set it to reach out and kill. 5) ""Man-Eater of Surrey Green""  When a outer space artichoke, lands and takes root, and begins killing eminent horticulturists, Emma and Steed get out the Roundup.  Rocky and Bullwinkle fought a similar plant in the cartoons - wonder who was first...lol? 6) ""Two's A Crowd"" Russian agents had let loose a doppelganger for Steed, in order to infiltrate a defense conference 7) ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" is one of my fav episodes.  Steed has been having a strange nightmare, so he welcomes the invitation for Hols in the country at friends.  He invites Emma to tag along.

The cinematography is curiously rather bleached, for what probably should have been a starker melodrama  -  but it works splendidly, anyway.  This one consists mostly of skulking and good fights, Emma's skulking done in a fetching peignoir by moonlight.  The flirtation between Emma and Steed is especially light and playful.  The plot, about a secret submarine base and its connection to the disruption of the local economy, is clever and credibly handled. ""The Master Minds"" is one of my personal favorites, about a MENSA-esque high-I.Q. club called RANSACK, which utilizes the best minds in Britain  -  without their knowledge  -  to infiltrate and sabotage military bases, and steal state secrets for sale to the highest bidder.  It's quite similar to Ian Fleming's contemporaneous James Bond novel, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""  -  which, amusingly enough, starred Diana Rigg in the film version.  Like ""Castle De'ath,"" Steed and Emma work undercover at the same location, but with a far different result:  Emma becomes brainwashed into RANSACK's nocturnal espionage society, and Steed has to snap her out of it  -  before she kills him.

They are all good, folks. No need to feel disloyal for liking more than one. However, stay away from the William Hurt version. He did not even come close to filling Mr. Rochesters shoes. It was a train wreck. What I really like about this version is the sweet chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. She finds him charming in spite of how flawed he is, and it really shows in her expressions. Ciaran Hinds' Mr. Rochester is abrupt and unpolished, and I rather liked his portrayal. His Mr. Rochester is gruff, passionate, volatile, and vulnerable. And Samantha Morton's Jane is spunky, sweet, and feminine, I think more so than other Jane Eyre's.

Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie. While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!  As for this particular one:  Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!  Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone. How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated. Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!! ..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture! _________  If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book). If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).

Institutionalized by her aunt (Deborah Findlay -Cranford), child Jane's life can get no worse. Moved on as a governess at Thornfield, its wealthy owner Mr Rochester (Ciaran Hinds). Jane trifles with love after a not so dignified introduction. There is a strangeness about the house and among those living there. This version dwells little on the child Jane, but focuses on her relationship with her master. Secrets are hidden behind a closed 3rd floor, a female, a dangerous person. Jane is even required to stop a murder. It is the inner struggle of mature emotion that makes Jane Eyre such a compulsive story, written by Charlotte Bronte as one of her finest novel works. No faults can be said of this fine cast. Samantha Morton is superb and believable as Jane. Gemma Jones (Last Tango in Halifax) plays Mrs Fairfax here, and has been a favorite of ours since she starred in `The Duchess of Duke Street.' My wife and I both liked this DVD version of Jane Eyre.

1626,1626,5,True,"10 18, 2012",A2AVOVUTRTABTX,0767020294,{'Format:': ' DVD'},K. Schrecker,"I love Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, and I've read it several times.  Also an avid movie fan, I have seen almost every production of Jane Eyre.  I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner.  Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.  However, this version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton is my second favorite for several reasons.  First, the casting was perfect.  Ciaran Hinds does a wonderful job portraying Edward Rochester, a complex, authoritative and tortured man who is hiding a horrible secret.  He is supposed to be almost 20 years older than Jane and not overly handsome--although not as moody and dark as Orson wells, he gives the character more humor and fits the bill admirably.  Samantha Morton is simply fantastic as Jane Eyre.  She is my favorite of all the female leads to date.  She is not as pretty as Joan Fontaine or Mia Wasikowska, but she is attractive enough to be pleasant to watch.  (Jane is supposed to be ""plain."")  Her Jane has much more personality compared to other actresses who have played the part.  She gives us a strong, confident Jane while showing us enough warmth to make her sympathetic to the viewer.  She is Jane Eyre in my eyes.  The two leads have one thing that many other versions do not--fantastic chemistry!!!  Together, they sizzle on the screen, which is something you would not expect from these two as a couple.  The production is fantastic, as is the photography and script adaptation.  I have only two beefs with this production--first, the actress playing Adele was too old and rather irritating.  Second, I absolutely hate the singing voice they dubbed in for Edward/Ciaran--that high, operatic tenor just didn't seem like it could come out of his throat.  If they could have fixed those two things, this would have been the perfect version.  As for the other versions I have seen, I'll list them here in my order of preference with a quick review:  3)  2011 Version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fessbender:  My third favorite; major problems include Mia being way too pretty to play Jane, and she needed a bit more personality.  Michael Fessbender was admirable as Rochester, but he physically did not fit the part--too handsome and too ""blonde"".  Rochester was always referred to being dark, mysterious with black hair and eyes--hard to get past that part, but he is a sexy man. 4)  2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens:  Non-descript actors, but a decent production.  Except for one hot scene with Jane and Edward on the bed (which would NEVER have happened in the novel), sort of forgettable. 5)  1971 Version with George C. Scott and Susannah York:  Miscast; both leads were too old for the parts--so/so version, nothing too much going on here. 6)  2003 Version with Willian Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg:  I like Willian Hurt, but I hated him in this part.  Too blonde, too cold, no mystery here.  Charlotte Gainsbourg was painfully plain with NO personality.  This was as dry as toast and uninteresting with little to hold your attention.  NO chemistry between the two leads--absolutely none. 7)  BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke:  There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton!  He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward.  There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, ""Do you find me handsome?"" and she answers ""No.""  What a laugh!  Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy.  No one could get past this without laughing.  He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward.  On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production!  His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock.  Not attractive, which isn't a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton.  In real life, Ol' Tim wouldn't have looked twice in her direction.  Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy.  So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production.  It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV/BBC production so you can't expect much.  I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it.",One of the BEST!,1350518400,5.0,,horrible cold toast i've realize admirably york attractive time problem get favorite orson many thing expect happen reason different ciaran direction date uninteresting read bill part pimple versions--but couple production--first version bite almost pleasant ruth version screen would fit miscast bad photography include lead handsome plus two seal without eye george tim drove trashing every actress portrayal small review know masterful samantha laugh date hard female handsome--although fix black admit much blonde rock none personality create star like dry could come character moody zelah wasikowska hold can't nothing several dark name authoritative problem clarke avid bronte's edward preference see bbc one depth love toby jane make whole fontaine forever give susannah first fantastically hate call dub lack-luster brooding hiding also decent still suppose attention voice see year plain side scene portray parts--so/so asks play forgettable gothic classic old part--too eyre operatic always dalton see rather torture give horribly hated second actor hinds rochester play crazy i'll adaptation hurt order however true simply among script not--fantastic successful hot job non-descript lover willian least enough morton secret feasibly michael third eyes--hard whose beef sizzle look little thing course face entire wilson chemistry place act good tv/bbc quick charlotte fit hollywood major ol early watch mia mood tenor joan keep masterpiece man make novel pet move stephen wooden life wonderful physically overly strong laugh adele viewer timothy fessbender throat find mysterious complex way manner bronte refer candy movie perfect warmth scott wart scenes--it high something eye real together--the answer beloved play pure edward/ciaran--that need showing theatre compare hair sexy mystery painfully go twice sing confident well together list wells/joan sort leads--absolutely fantastic hold bed irritate fan sympathetic production humor gainsbourg cast except view never grand actress seem admirable past older absolutely qualities pretty

This wonderful series has become a British institution and a worldwide favorite among viewers.  It has a huge fan following. The story follows the lives and loves of the Bellamy family who reside in a fashionable house in Eaton Place.  Downstairs, their loyal and lively servants uphold their own code of values whilst trying to come to terms with an ever-changing world.  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS covers the years 1903-1930, and features fantastic writing and direction, not to mention top-drawer performances from a gloriously talented cast. Season 1 - We are introduced to the Bellamy family:  Richard (David Langton), his wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their grown-up children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  In the first episode, ""On Trial"", we also meet the vivacious Clemence (Pauline Collins) who arrives at 165 Eaton Place looking for a job.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she's quickly inducted into the household, but finds life as a servant frustrating and unnatural. Later choice moments in the season include ""Magic Casements"", where Lady Marjorie has a brief and tender affair with a young army captain; ""The Path of Duty"" features the rebellious Elizabeth running away from home on the eve of her society debut; ""Why is Her Door Locked?"" recounts the unhappy, emotionally-disturbed Mrs Bridges (Angela Baddeley) kidnapping a small child.  The season ends on a hopeful note as Elizabeth marries the romantic poet Lawrence Kirbridge (Ian Ogilvy) in ""For Love of Love"". Season 2 - Picks up the story following Elizabeth and Lawrence's honeymoon, and their household in Greenwich.  Humorous scenes downstairs featuring Rose (Jean Marsh), Thomas (John Alderton) and Mrs Fellowes (Dorothy Frere) contrast dramatically with the unhappy marriage of Elizabeth and Lawrence upstairs. Other standout episodes include ""Your Obediant Servant"", where Hudson (Gordon Jackson) dresses up as a toff in order to impress his brother's family who are visiting from India; ""The Property of a Lady"" where Sarah and Thomas attempt to help Lady Marjorie who's being blackmailed about her secret affair from Season 1; and ""Out of the Everywhere"" where the resourceful Sarah once again saves the day for the Bellamy's.  Perhaps the season is best-remembered for ""Guest of Honour"" in which King Edward comes to dine at 165.  This season marked the last for Elizabeth, Thomas and Sarah. Season 3 - Another strong season, which gets off to a cracking start in ""Miss Forrest"", in which Richard has hired the services of secretary Hazel Forrest (Meg Wynn Owen) while he is busy writing Lord Southwold's political biography.  Lady Marjorie is getting ready for a voyage on the Titanic... Later standouts include ""A Perfect Stranger"" where Rose gets her first taste of real love when she meets charming Gregory Wilmot (Keith Barron), an Australian sheep-farmer. Romance also keeps up James who impetuously proposes to and marries the mild-mannered Hazel;  ""Goodwill to all Men"" introduces us to Lord Southwold's young ward Georgina Worsley (Lesley-Anne Down), and a charming storyline featuring the second (and last) appearance of Cathleen Nesbitt as Dowager Lady Southwold.  The season ends on a dramatic note when World War One is declared. Season 4 - Generally regarded by fans as the strongest of the five seasons, with superb acting and cracker storylines.  The season starts off with ""A Patriotic Offering"" where Lady Prudence (Joan Benham) suggests that Hazel takes in a family of Belgian refugees.  ""The Beastly Hun"" features an Emmy-winning performance from Gordon Jackson; whilst ""If You Were the Only Girl in the World"" has Hazel falling in love with a handsome young airman who is later tragically killed in a bombing strike.  The season also introduces us to the charming naval widow Virginia Hamilton (Hannah Gordon), who turns to Richard for help when her oldest son is to be court-martialled.  The season ends on a tragic note when Hazel contracts a severe and dangerous strain of the flu virus just as peace is declared by England. Season 5 - James and Georgina settle into a party lifestyle with their mindless society friends, whilst the newly-married Richard and Virginia settle into life at Eaton Place with her two young children Alice (Anne Yarker) and William (Jonathan Seely).  ""A Place in the World"" details bored and dissatisfied James following his father in politics; ""Disillusion"" follows an ill-fated romance between Hudson and young maid Lily (Karen Dotrice), and Georgina toys with a career as a movie actress in ""Alberto"".  The season ends with the marriage of Georgina and Robert, the Marquis of Stockbridge (Anthony Andrews).  James returns from a trip to America with big dreams about the Stock Exchange, but then the Wall Street crash puts the financial future of  the Bellamy's in doubt... There aren't enough words to express how much I love UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS.

It dealt with issues not often talked about in the early 70s, both the social issues that permiate through the series, and also such issues, in certain episodes, as prejudice, suicide, and homosexuality.   This is the story of the Bellamy household at 165 Eaton Place, London, both the upstairs family (the Bellamy family, led by Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament) and the downstairs family (the servants, led by Angus Hudson, the butler, who in his way is more aristocratic than the aristocrats).  Yet in many ways, they are a single family, and we see them from the period 1905 to the 1920s, an era of profound social change, and we see the effects such changes have on this household, from a time when going ""into service"" was routine to the time when having half a dozen servants for a small upper middle class family such as the Bellamys was beginning to be the exception, not the rule.   The series includes rarely shown episodes from the 1st season, as well as the special, Upstairs Downstairs Remembered: The 25th Anniversary Special.  While the special is included with the first series episodes, I would advise waiting until you have viewed the entire series before watching the special, to avoid any plot points being given away.   The acting is wonderful, led by Gordon Jackson (as Hudson, the butler), David Langton (as Richard Bellamy), and Jean Marsh (as house parlormaid Rose Buck).  Marsh also originated and guided the series.  These three characters seem like rocks, upon which the waves of the social changes beat.  Yet they are worn and changed by the events of this incredible era.  Nonetheless, this is very much an ensemble cast--no character appears in more than 60 of the 68 episodes.   The first season seems almost experimental--many of the episodes have specific themes, such as those mentioned above.  A couple were unsuccessful and their events are never referred to again (for example, ""The Swedish Tiger"").  In the remaining seasons, events tend to build over the thirteen episodes, to culminate to some extent in the final episode of the season, which usually deals with a major event in the world (for example the King's death at the end of the second season, the start of the war in the third, the end of the war in the fourth).   Perhaps the most powerful episodes are those dealing with World War I, and the profound waste of the war, as many of the best of the generation are lost.  By the end of the War, there has been tremendous tragedy, and even the most ardent supporter of the war doubts the justice of the war.  But do not underestimate the fifth season, as the social structure crumbles.  The signs of this crumbling are seen throughout the earlier episodes, but they come to a head in the fifth season.   I have tried  to avoid discussing the plot, so as not to give away the plot events that should come as a surprise to you.  But suffice it to say that this is one of the first series when anything can happen within the framework of the series, when you could not count on everything ending happily by the end of the hour--or at all.

Spanning five seasons, the writing, acting, and directing were uniformly excellent. Upstairs are the Bellamy family. The two members that continue for all five seasons are Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament, and his son James, a Captain in the English army. Downstairs are the servants who are led for all five seasons by Hudson, the butler, Mrs. Bridges, the cook, and Rose, a maid. The performances by all these principals were excellent in every respect. Dozens of other characters come in and out of the various plots throughout the years. Most notable are Richard Bellamy's first wife Lady Marjorie and a niece, Georgina. Downstairs Edward, the footman and chauffeur, his wife Daisy, and Ruby, helper to Mrs. Bridges, all played important roles in the series. Many things make this series great and the stories come first. The Bellamy family and their servants are living in tumultuous times, the first thirty years or so of the 20th Century. The 1st World War, ""the war to end all wars,"" was a defining moment in time for the English, the Bellamy family, and their servants. The war changed everyone and everything forever and this series does justice to the horror of that terrible event and its impact on the lives of the English people. But the war is only a part of the story line, albeit an important one. We come to know the Bellamys and their servants almost as well as our own family. In fact, they seem to become a part of our family, so real are the stories and the performances of the actors. Rarely have actors in a television series ever been able to provide so much depth of characterization. This is due largely to the fine direction and superb dialogue of the scripts for each episode of the series. For the most part the action takes place in the Bellamy's London home. Over five seasons we see little of London except through the windows of the Bellamy's house. The war footage is a notable exception to this statement. Even so, enough is happening under that roof to keep us genuinely interested and engaged. I had not seen this series when it originally aired thirty years ago and only by accident saw a video of a first season episode. I was quickly ""hooked"" and then watched the rest of the five seasons on DVD. Other than taking less room on your shelf, the DVDs did not appear to me to be much better than the video I viewed. It seemed to me as if the program, like a fine wine, aged gracefully and improved over time. I know that I enjoyed each season just a bit more than the last and with great regret watched the final episodes. It was as if I were saying goodbye forever to close friends and family. This series is good enough for a repeat viewing and so I have the deferred pleasure of knowing I will be reintroduced to the Bellamys and all their servants at some later time.

Scott/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it's one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester.  She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn't watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me.  She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton.  As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn't Rochester. The George C. Scott/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part. . There are many comments about the Hinda/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I've seen the Hinds/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds' and Morton's recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding.  Hinds' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds' part.  The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.  Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.

He got so wild when Jane ""bewitched"" his horse that I thought he was going to take his wife's place in the attic. So over-the-top was his rough exterior that his passionate scenes with Jane at first evoked from me hearty laughter, which I don't think was the intended effect. She'd never like a guy like that, and he'd...well. I just wasn't seeing it. At first.  So why the five star rating? Because this is a difficult movie to get right. It's not five stars for perfection, but five stars for being far and away the best adaptation of the four I've seen so far.  It spares you lengthy portrayals of the scenes where a little goes a long way (Lowood, also the Auntie's stewardship of Jane, etc.) and instead saves the film for scenes that really need to be developed carefully in order for the lengthy novel to be credible onscreen. That is, Rochester and Jane need time to grow in their relationship. Some adaptations try to rush it and you see Jane falling in love with a crazy, irate cooky guy who explores his deepest affect, out loud and rather distastefully, to what appears onscreen to be a complete stranger not ridiculously fond of him. This version was a very nice effort, but there was one part a bit rushed-her missing him after she simply tells us they had more talks together. A minor detail. Her portrayal was very good and real. Compare it to the 1996 version (Hurt/Gainsbourg) where Rochester comments to Jane about the tears ready to come into her eyes. This is after Jane is forced to watch Rochester with the new chick on the block. Then he says, ""or do I see them there now?"" Problem is, she doesn't look at all like she's upset or about to cry, or even depressed, although perhaps disappointed and maybe slightly wounded. Under these circumstances, Rochester's assessment makes him look self-important, sadistic and weird.  Although, in this version (1997) I think Jane gets too passionate too soon, before Rochester has begun much transformation and become truly transparent and honest which I think took a bit away from the credibility. Then again, Jane comes from Lowood.  Bottom line: For delicate, complex development, sensitive performances, and for sparing us the stuff we don't need much of in favor of the parts that need the time to develop, I give it five.

Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship.

Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.

But this movie isn't the book and I liked it as well. One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils. Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his ""grand passion"" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason. Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.

First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.",Definitely the Worst of the TV/Movie Adaptions,1041897600,6.0,,fall give fall second disagree measure rochester involve much rack chance hurt character examples positive vice liberty ever woman figure mr william others vengeful young area normally book cruel many poor codependent vindictive reason great terribly minute creature must victim superior long detract fervently little repugnant nearly course show love jane reduce worthless far leave reason plot necessarily strange take first enhance version major hardly version profane love thus would singular particularly brooding brevity bad see misguide attach writer aspect unconditionally psyche vitality willing novel main inferior short review best two life greatly redeem every small rather film viewer

Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield. And then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version. Some have said that Timothy Dalton is ""too handsome"" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester.

No, it is not as true to the book as some other versions, but it captures the spirit and tells the story in a very compelling, moving-it-along way. I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way. I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well. Ciran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable! The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered ""ugly."" Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel. I highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre.

1761,1761,5,False,"10 10, 2013",A3OH36BA3YSN7M,0767087372,{'Format:': ' DVD'},timcon1964,"One of the greatest dramatic series of all time, Upstairs Downstairs (U/D) is about life at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London.  It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition.  Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.  British actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins conceived U/D as a comedy focused on the downstairs staff.  But it gradually evolved into a drama about the entire household--both upstairs and downstairs.  London Weekend producer Cyril Bennett did not believe that U/D would be successful.  He held Series 1 off the air for six months, then chose to broadcast it at 10:15 on Sunday nights.  Despite this scheduling, the show became one of the most popular PBS programs of all time.  The household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family.  As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family's preferences.  Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic.  Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him.  His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic.  Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America.  Following Marjorie's death, management of the household falls to James's new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family.  Marjorie's niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure.  After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.  The downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants.  Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip.  Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her ""place"" in the system.  Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl.  Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah.  Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career.  At the bottom of the servants' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).  Interestingly, all the award nominations went to the downstairs actors, although it seemed to this reviewer that nearly all the actors put in strong performances.  Two personal favorites are Raymond Huntley's portrayal of the very formal, punctilious, and bespectacled family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon; and Jenny Tomasin's performance as the uneducated and unrespected scullery maid Ruby.  Tomasin took to heart Jackson's comment that there were no small parts, only small actors, and her rendering of Ruby may become a model for future actresses.  Fortunately, there are occasions on which Ruby knows more than the other servants, and when she shows initiative by leaving 165 Eaton Place to take a factory job, and by soliciting correspondence through a dating service--these events prevent Ruby from becoming a caricature.  The 68 episodes vary in quality; but there are few really poor ones.  The stories deal with a wide range of matters, including family relations, infidelity, divorce, inappropriate pregnancies, miscarriages, espionage, murder, suicide, casualties of war, politics, and the consequences of prosperity and depression.  Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash.  The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king's visit to 165 Eaton Place.  Many viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) the least successful.  (Most of this series was not aired in the U.S. until many years later.)  It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white.  Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program.  As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility.  Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed.  Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth's suffrage activities.  King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death.  Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy's secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy.  Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household.  She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James.  This series ends with the outbreak of World War I.  The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best.  The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria.  The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb.  Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s.  Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia.  But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior, aided by such new technologies as autos, airplanes, and motion pictures.  As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.  It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; and U/D has had several imitators, including Beacon Hill (1975), as well as a new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs-2010/dp/B004N66XYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs, Downstairs (2010)</a>&nbsp;.

Consider the similarities:  In both the wealth comes from the woman's side of the family.  Both Richard (U/D) and Robert (DA) are in precarious financial situations:  When Marjorie dies, the family fortune goes to Richard's children.  Without a male heir, Downton Abbey will go to another branch of the family.  In both programs:  (1) family members die (or appear to die) on the Titanic, (2) the young men are involved in World War I (in each, the principal young male character, after being missing in action, returns home gravely wounded; in each household, one of the domestic servants suffers from shell shock); (3) a young female member of the family becomes a wartime nurse; (4) a young woman dies from influenza; (5) there is a downstairs romance; (6) there is a homosexual footman; (6) a male aristocrat refuses to take responsibility for a child he has fathered by a maid; (7) an adventurous young daughter gets into trouble from her involvement in the suffrage movement; (8) the cook is courted by an unworthy suitor; (9) the question arises as to who will fill in for the ailing butler; (10) the household feels obliged to dismiss an unsatisfactory nanny; and (11) the family suffers from making bad investments.  Well, you get the idea.  This 21-disc set provides several supplementary features.  (1) The production of each Series is documented in an accompanying program, featuring interviews with writers, directors, actors.  (2) ""Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs"" (1975), in which talk show host Russell Harty visits cast members on the set shortly after the final episode was broadcast.  (3) ""Upstairs Downstairs Remembered"" (1996), narrated by Gareth Hunt, in which cast members give accounts of behind-the-scenes problems and accomplishments.  (4)  In ""Sandy's Last Stand"" (2006), composer Alexander Faris describes how he wrote the theme music, including the ""upstairs"" theme and the ""downstairs"" theme (""What are We Going to Do With Uncle Arthur?"").  This includes performances of both the original 4/4 and the more familiar 3/4 versions of the upstairs theme, and the downstairs theme.  Upstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.  By informal count, Upstairs Downstairs was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series.  It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1.  It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production.  The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it.  Cyril Bennett, who had been reluctant to air the program in the first place, pleaded vociferously, but ineffectively, with John Hawkesworth that the program should be  extended  for another ten years.  Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.  Christopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U/D as ""the sort of series that doesn't come along more than once in a lifetime.""  Few would disagree.  [NOTE:  The sticking problem seems to result from a spindle hole that is slightly too small.  Enlarging the spindle hole by as little as .001 of an inch with the aid of a round mini-file or fine sandpaper seems to correct the problem. Perhaps some other reviewer can explain why this is so.

It contains 68 episodes on 20 DVDs, plus one DVD with quite a few bonus features The first season comprises 13 episodes and the first episodes seem spare, especially in the dialog--more like stage plays than video dramas of today's miniseries.  Later episodes lose that stagey-ness and become very involved dramas. Since the original series broadcast in the US did not include the black-and-white episodes,  I was not familiar with the development of the series and how it grew from a rather simple initial season to rather involved arcs. For that ALONE, I'd recommend this set of DVD's because seeing them all in series is fascinating. And I saw entirely new episodes (for me) as I'd missed a lot of the first seasons, being off at college and without a television for some years.  I was also able to look at the opening titles with the drawings from ""Punch"" (A British humor magazine) and admire how the producers selected amazingly apt drawings to fit the particular episode.  Some of the initial episodes, sadly, are recorded only in black and white due to a technicians' strike in the early 70's. It doesn't actually detract from the enjoyment, just makes it a bit sad we can't see the sets and costuming as they were filmed. The black & white are sharp and clear, but the color episodes can be somewhat lower in resolution. The colors can be dim as well, but it doesn't detract. The cropping is often odd. This is not a perfect conversion from the television to DVD, but it's adequate and probably a lot has to do with changes in technologies since the 70's and the early days of television-to-DVD remastering.  The extras are lavish:  Extras:  5-part documentary: The Making of Upstairs Downstairs 24 episode commentaries Upstairs, Downstairs Remembered - with Gareth Hunt (51:50) Russell Harty Goes Upstairs Downstairs (30:00) Sandy's Last Stand with composer Alexander Faris (13:15) Simon Williams and Alfred Shaughnessy in Conversation (22:50) ""Russell Harty Plus"" Interview with Gordon Jackson (6:40) ""Russell Harty Plus"" Interview with Jean Marsh (11:15) ""Russell Harty Plus"" Interview with Angela Baddeley (9:40)  Alternate version of Episode 1 ""On Trial""  Essay by star and co-creator Jean Marsh  It's nice to go visit old friends again and have all the episodes and extras.

I think they reran it after that. I can remember watching part of one episode, but it didn't appeal to me. Well, maybe I was too young to appreciate it.  Fast forward to a few months ago. Now middle aged, I decided to give this series another try. At first, it seemed OK, but I wasn't sure if I'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series. Didn't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV. But, I watched a few more episodes and got more interested. Before I knew it, I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done. I was sad to see the last episode end. The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.  I think the first episode is set in 1903 and the last in 1930. Many characters come and go, but many appear in the whole run like Mr. Hudson, Mrs. Bridges, Rose and Richard Bellamy.  The British class system in all its ""glory"" is illustrated as the series rolls on. And how it starts to unravel a bit as time moves forward. I guess as an American, it is hard to believe how those lower on the food chain put up with this system, but I guess we had something similar at the time here, but maybe less rigid. I'm told that the British still retain a bit of the old system even today, while we seem to have been a little more successful at getting rid of our old system.  But, I think one positive point that is often overlooked about the old system is well illustrated. There was some sense of family ties of a sort between the upstairs family and the long time servants downstairs.  The series did try to bring to life the big events going on at the time the series is set. It also showed how the upstairs people and the servants saw these events in very similar ways in many cases. I was surprised at how the servants were so often in agreement with the upstairs people on politics. Maybe they all valued stability and tradition very much and so agreed on the politics as a result.  Sometimes the formality of the interactions between the upstairs folk and the servants was almost comical, but it was still kind of nice to see it at times. We seem to live in a world without much in the way of good manners anymore.  I'm sure that much has been written on the details of the series already by other reviewers, so I don't think there is much I could add there. So, I'll just say that this is a great series to watch and well worth the time required to watch all the episodes.  There was a continuation series that aired recently which I did watch well before I got far along in the old series reviewed here.  They don't seem all that related to me now that I have seen all of both. The new series was not very popular and didn't last very long. Two short seasons maybe.

However, since I am such a fan of Downton Abbey, I thought I would give it a try. And I am so glad I did. It begins in 1903 when there were still horse drawn carriages and strict rules of decorum, and goes through WWI, the roaring twenties, and into the Great Depression. I found the families very enduring, both upstairs and downstairs, and their struggles very real. You will love the characters: Mrs. Bridges, Ruby, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Sara, Thomas, Fredrick, and Daisy, and last, but not least, the Bellamy family and their friends.  It does not necessarily have a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one. I will be sure to watch this series again and again. I think it gives a good insight into the history of the time as well as telling an enduring story. It shows the decline of the noble class in England, how it began and came about. That was a little sad to me because I think we lost something of elegance and grace along the way to progress, and I could not help feeling that I wished we had at least some of it back. All in all, this is a very good series. I wish there had been more of it. I would have liked to seen what happened to the characters during the Great Depression.  The newer, more modern, series is also good, but sadly it was not renewed so it really does not have an ending, happy or otherwise. I was really looking forward to see how England survived WWII.

My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.  Okay, the ""cheap"" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.  The production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!

I enjoyed the show immensely, it was really rather a first offering of PBS, then known primarily as a fledgling ""artsy"" station, presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston. From its first episode, Up/Down oozed quality in every way: superb acting, writing, direction, production, with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke's introduction, while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode, to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme, Mouret's Rondo, which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.   The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs ""family"". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their ""upstairs"" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both ""families"", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.  This 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews. I had VHS taped some of the original Up/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80's, which I still have. However, I wanted the DVD version, and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon.  Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.  The episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD's in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn't get much better than this. I urge all Up/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself.

Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs.

A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.  SERIES 1: 1903-09, introduces cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between the working and upper classes. Great plots in every episode, too many to list. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Delightful set and an array of costuming that shows both the upper and lower class dress of the times. SERIES 2: 1908-10, shows life with a newly married Bellamy, potential fatherhood, and romance downstairs too. All scandalous in high society, as is several topics this show dared to address in the 70s. Cast members playing Sarah and Thomas would eventually marry in real-life. SERIES 3: 1912-14, the period finds Kind Edward VII is dead and pending war. World war and politics are just a fraction of the turmoil found at house 165. Love upstairs and downstairs is as treacherous as the war trenches. Reason enough for this seasons' best drama series Emmy & Golden globe. SERIES 4: 1914-18, the Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Another 2 Emmys won due to struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but historical look at WWI, on the London home front. SERIES 5: 1919-30, the largest span of time. War's end. The 1920's roar, and that impacts the family upstairs as well as the lively help downstairs. But even war fails to change some things, like scandal, family disgrace, celebrations, and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.  After the airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept.

Most Americans saw the series when it ran on local PBS stations and later cable's A&E channel, while Canadians viewed it via the CBC.   The series dealt with the rich and the poor and as any lover of soap opera knows when you pit these two types of people together fireworks will ignite. Indeed a soap, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" dealt with the rich Bellamy family living in the high class Belgravia neighborhood in London. Their lives were intertwined by their servants who lived ""downstairs"" and who wanted to attain the richness and social standing of their employers. World War 1 was the backdrop for the serial which only added extra drama to the show.   ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" is known as the series where many Hollywood leading ladies received their start, most notably Jean Marsh (who had a hand in the creation of the show) and Lesley-Ann Down, most famous for her role in ""North and South"" and currently starring in ""The Bold and the Beautiful"".

Sadly, when the producers went into the ITV archives to clean the show's original prints it was discovered the pilot had been ""wiped"" which was the custom for many British shows in the early seventies.

Over five seasons during the 1970s, Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain, while in America, it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.  Upstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place, London from about 1903 to 1930.  The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants.  The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs (the Bellamys and their friends and relatives) and Downstairs (the assorted servants) was beautifully done.  Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish, but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.  This megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons.  Some of the transfers are not all that clear, and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely.

Danzig,"What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!  I was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.  At any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.  With clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.  The steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.  In the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.  Watching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.  This megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were ""upstairs"" dressing rooms for the cast and ""downstairs"".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the ""upstairs"" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!  Then there is the spinoff series, ""Thomas and Sarah"", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as ""Up Down"" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.  I have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of ""digital dither"" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.  Still, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.  One hopes, as others have noted, that A&E will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.

When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a ""Harry Potter"" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled ""Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?"" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson ""Miss Marple""s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things.

The whole show is actually a time capsule during the time of pre-WWI UK and after (up to the US stock market crash in 1929.) It is very interesting to note the various stages of changes that were happening during that time. It's like a history lesson but with more fun in it (apologies to my History teacher.) In this, the makers of this wonderful miniseries did not fail in their mission to make things as authentic as possible. Personally, I cannot boast about knowing much about English soceity during the Edwardian era, for my knowledge of it actually comes from period movies and television programs that I had seen before. But when I said ""authentic,"" what I meant was that we can see and feel the labour of love that was put into every detail to make the show feel at home in its period setting.  In addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the ""Upstairs"" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the ""Downstairs"" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.  Having said the above, I guarantee that you will root for most of the characters. I love Lady Marjorie the best; captivating Georgina, no-nonsense Hazel, and Virginia as the second Mrs. Bellamy I love second. They are such adorable and charming people. I shall never forget that scene where Lady Marjorie tells Hudson the butler that ""the King will be dining with us next week."" She was picture-perfect in that one. As for the men, I always admire Mr. Bellamy for his political convictions. Although we don't actually get to see the hearings in the House of Commons, we do get a firsthand look of what goes on behind the life of a parliament member. It is this aspect of the show that gives ""Upstairs Downstairs"" its political dimension. As for Elizabeth and James, I disliked them most of the time because they are spoiled, but they do have their human moments. Plus, Nicola Pagett and Simon Williams are such good, good actors. These two have some of the best parts in the whole series; Simon Williams, especially, as James, during the War years and after that.  Going now to the servants, there's Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There's also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in ""The Hero's Farewell,"" one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won't be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.  The last episode is a touching one, since we would have gotten used to the characters and feel that we know them already. I was sorry to see the members of the Bellamy household disbanded like that. I especially felt heart-pangs when Rose (Jean Marsh) was closing down the empty house. The ghosts of the past whispered into her ears as she did this, from floor to floor of 165 Eaton Place. These final few minutes of the show will not soon go away from your memory,.  As companions to this series, I would like to recommend the ""Berkeley Square"" Series and Stephen Poliakoff's ""The Lost Prince."" Both of these can be had here at Amazon. There is no doubt that ""Berkeley Square"" had its roots in ""Upstairs Downstairs."" To see ""Berkeley Square"" is to extend the enjoyment after viewing ""Upstairs Downstairs."" But to get a better understanding of the political situation of the time period, I would recommend Stephen Poliakoff's ""The Lost Prince."" This is considered to be one of Mr. Poliakoff's best works. I guarantee that ""Berkeley Square"" and ""The Lost Prince"" will not disappoint. Both are BBC productions.  Overall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode ""Alberto"" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an ""R"" rating. Other than that, it's mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.  A word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn't give it a lot of expectations. I think there's a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer.

With sixty-eight 50-minute episodes, the series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, and on into the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.  Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer and who, like a bad penny, turns up on the Bellamys' doorstep periodically during the first two series, or the new capable-but-just-as-conniving chauffeur, Thomas (Collins' real-life husband, John Alderton), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs ""family"" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.  This boxed set includes the 1979 spin-off series entitled Thomas and Sarah (thirteen 50-minute episodes), which chronicles the adventures and misadventures of those two memorable miscreants after they leave the Bellamy's employ.  Unlike Upstairs Downstairs, which is fairly high drama infused with a spattering comic relief here and there, Thomas and Sarah is very much a comedy-drama.  With Sarah's penchant for foreign accents and tale-telling and the conniving and entrepreneurial spirit that both characters embody, the stage is set for some thoroughly enjoyable vignettes. Most of the episodes involve the couple trying their hands (and luck) at something new--like running a match-making agency, working in a boys' school, working as magicians, and so on.  For all their efforts, however, they always seem to find themselves skint--and thus the need for another enterprise (and hence another enjoyable episode!).  The only thing less than satisfactory is the ""conclusion"" of the final episode, which left me wondering whether or not a second series was at least anticipated.  But that's is a minor quibble, for this is a series to be watched for the sheer enjoyment of the journey.  One final dvd bonus is the enjoyable and informative 50-minute 25th Anniversary Special,  which was produced around 1998 and includes remembrances by many of the surviving actors (including James, Elizabeth, Rose, Edward, Daisy, and Ruby).  In conclusion, Upstairs Downstairs is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  It is compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of ""goings on,"" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!

The boxed set contains all five series (with a total of 68 episodes).  Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910. There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite. Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI. Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed. Series five covers the twenties.  In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama.

Hornaday,"I rejoice in the technological development of DVDs which provides the perfect format for the celebrated release, in one complete box set, of one of the finest series that has ever graced, or will ever grace, TV!  This British series is truly in a ""class"" by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s.  The story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family ""Upstairs"" at 165 Eaton Place, London, and their servants ""Downstairs,"" but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen.  The characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, unwed mothers, change, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath.  The ""master"" of the house, Sir Richard Bellamy, played with genuine heart by David Langton, is in Parliament thanks to the enormous political influence of the family of his well-bred wife, Lady Marjorie Southwold Bellamy, played with aplumb and surprising depth by Rachel Gurney.  We come to know the couple and their problems, as we witness a doomed love affair by Marjorie with an artist that she forsakes to save her mariage and which underscores the power of duty in English society. Richard learns of the affair but doesn't address it directly with his wife, whom he resolutely adores, but instead stands by her as she grieves for the one true love she has chosen to give up. Marjorie's life is cut short (the actress left the show after two seasons) after a fateful voyage on the Titanic.  The Bellamy's house parlormaid Rose Buck is portrayed by Jean Marsh, who created the show and starred throughout the series. Rose is compassionate, tough and as real a ""person"" as if she had actually been alive.  Other tremendous characters of this brilliant ensamble cast include the butler, Angus Hudson, portrayed by the late, great Gordon Jackson, the Bellamy's cook, Mrs. Kate Bridges, played by the late Angela Baddeley, and the Bellamy's son, James Bellamy, played by the gifted Simon Williams.  It is Hudson who not only keeps the house running smoothly, but is also the keeper of English social propriety and tradition, objecting to modernization and the merging of social classes. Hudson desperately tries to hold onto the society he knew and loved, but international events conspire to change the very fibre of British culture.  But, it is through the character of James Bellamy that these historical events are played out. Initially, a ""useless"" member of the young nobility, James was restless and lived primarily for himself and leisure pursuits. Uncontrollably, he is swept up in the tide that became World War I and changed England, as well as the World, forever.  James becomes an officer and sees combat and the horrors of war. James eventually returns to Eaton Place after the war ends, but is unable to cope with his ""new"" life or reclaim his ""old"" one, so he ends it by his own hand in the former safety of the family estate.  As the series ends, the Edwardian age of English innocence and ""fun"" has also truly suffered a fatally self-inflicted wound. So, it is fitting that after James' suicide it is the nostalgic Hudson who, with a tear in his eye, closes the house -- and thereby symbolically, the era -- forever.  These are only a few of the characters and events that become real in the series, which ran through 68 riviting episodes.  This unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging family saga is not to be missed.

When this DVD set arrived, I hoped that at least it could recreate the Edwardian world for me, as it did 30+ years ago.  I was wrong.  It is so much better than I remember.  With the perspective and experience of thirty years coloring the viewing, the foibles and triumphs of the two families upstairs and down are so much more compelling now.  With the underlying theme that the house must run smoothly no matter what is going on in the inside or outside world, the dependence of the two families on each other is beautifully portrayed.  The period details, down to the china patterns and the paint colors are exquisite, and the characterizations the actors bring to their parts, made possible by the very fine writing, superb.    From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah ""On Trial"" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah's position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, ""There's no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb,"" the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy's diatribe when James loses Rose's inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys ""look after"" the servants (""I hate to see servants humiliated,"" says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.    Despite bombs falling, housemaids giving birth in the attic, party guests committing suicide outside the nursery, various forms of heartbreak occuring both upstairs and down, it's reassuring to know that at 165 Eaton Place, dinner will always be served by an impeccably clad butler on impeccably polished silver, and that tea in the servant's hall will always be accompanied by one of Mrs. Bridges' delicious cakes (when she's not in a snit about being made to go to a lecture on wartime cookery).    No, the quality of the DVDs is not the best, but given a choice between owning it, with all its glitches and jumps--and not having it available at all--I'll take it.

The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white.  The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!  The first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.  The first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop ""the bomb"" on Japan.  In addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.  The second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler's German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.  The DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more. This is excellent bonus footage and it lasts about twenty minutes.

The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals.  Its use of personal observances is remeniscent of the way Ken Burns used eye witness accounts in ""The Civil War"" to make more of an impact on the viewer. Evenso, from a historical perspective, ""Lost Color Archives"" does deserve high praise as a solid explanation of the war as a whole.  Because it is told largely from the eye witness point of view, the viewer has a sense of the impending conflict, then the endurance through the war, and finally, the exhausted conclusion.  Emphasis is placed on the fact that the war was over, but that much of the world had been destroyed and that the effects and rememberance of the war would linger on. Add color to all this and the documentary clearly stands above anything else I've ever seen about the war.

""The Crossing"" tells the story of General George Washington's preparations to attack the Hessian soldiers (in service to Britain) at Trenton on Christmas 1776.  The movie highlights the disagreements and personality conflicts between Washington and some of his key commanders, and the challenges of pulling off such a revolutionary attack.  The movie benefits from many quality actors and from its tight focus on the build-up to the crossing, the crossing, fight, and immediate aftermath.  I don't think I'd known until watching this that Washington's men retreated back across the river after the attack.  My only real quibble with the video quality is that you can tell where the commercial breaks were from the original TV production airing.  I would think that they could have edited the video together a little bit better so that those weren't as noticeable or else didn't exist at all on the DVD.  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie, but it was noticeable at least a few times.

The moment, and the movie, focus on a low point in American fortunes during the Revolutionary War.  Washington's Continental Army had been driven in defeat from New Jersey by the British Army, and faced dissolving altogether as enlistments expired at the end of the year.  Washington daringly staked everything on a surprise counter-attack that caught the enemy sleeping off the holiday in Trenton in the early hours of 26 December.  Washington's high stakes gamble saved the Continental Army, and perhaps the young United States, from extinction.  Jeff Daniels is very credible as the stern and determined Washington.  The supporting cast is also quite good, especially Sebastian Roche as the tough-minded General John Glover from Massachusetts, now unfortunately largely forgotten in history, whose Marblehead fishermen rowed the Army across an ice-choked river.

For twelve months the first American patriots had endured very little success against the British, being out-classed and routed from the battlefield in almost every engagement. Desertion was rampant. Arms, ammunition, and rations were scarce. Only a small number of the Revolutionaries had any military experience.  Even worse, as was usual in warfare until the 20th century, epidemic diseases were the major cause of casualties, with so many men living together in the open under unsanitary conditions. As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.  With the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.  At this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.  So how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!  General Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!  Washington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.  Despite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.  They moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.  This factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing: The Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning!

This film - despite some revisionism - is an excellent portrayal of the crossing and the Battle of Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a surprisingly good job of characterizing Washington's demeanor, patriotism and dedication to the ""Glorious Cause"", as most revolutionists of the time called our American Revolution. After all Daniels is not new to portraying historical military figures, having portrayed Joshua Chamberlain in ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". In fact the acting by the entire cast is uniformly good throughout. Despite his dedication and patriotism, Washington had surprisingly little military experience before taking command and had to learn as the revolution evolved. Trenton was his first real battlefield success. Washington came very close to losing his army; and we came very close to losing the Revolution in 1776. It was mostly due to Washington's determination and daring that we were able to continue fighting instead of going down to an inglorious defeat.

In 'The Crossing' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn't. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.  'The Crossing' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington's friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.

Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of ""John Adams"" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.

Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.  I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.  The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews.

The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.  I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.  Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.  The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.  Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school.

Compare this movie to say something like Mel Gibson's PATRIOT and you have the difference between quality and trash!  The movie conveys the feeling and desperation of Washy's army on its last legs before striking back at Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a spirted but probably false impression of Washy.  In reality the man was much more stiff and proper than is shown here.  Washy would never use such language in front of the common soldiers!  He rarely lost his temper as well, otherwise the famous tongue lashing of Charles Lee at Monmouth two years later would never have created such a sensation as it did.  Daniels makes Washy much more likeable to the modern audience, but is an flawed portrayal.  The production value of this film is first-rate.  Obviously period re-enactors were used and their dedication to the hobby shows in the correct formations, drills, etc.  The brief skirmish at the beginning with the British probably did not happen so close to the Delaware like that.  Also, the uniforms for the British appear off somehow.  They look like an earlier period, not the 1770s.  Still, it works.  The Hessians are well portrayed, although it would have provided variety if some Musketeer's with their tri-corn hats were shown.  Not all of Rall's men were Grenadiers and Fusiliers!  American losses were actually 2 dead from the march, and 4 wounded from the fight, including Hamilton and Monroe, the latter a future US President!  I don't know why the movie did not convey this.  The effects of Knox's artillery seems also much exaggerated.  Solid shot and cannister was used, not explosive shells as shown here.  Most films on this period fail to show artillery accurately in that regard.  Still, the acting and mood of the film are right on the mark which makes it easily the best Rev War production out there. Too bad it did not go further to show Washy's next great triumph at Princeton where a small British detachment gave him a much harder run for his money.

The film brings to the screen George Washington's first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.  It is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?  The Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:  We get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).  Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.  The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral's sword sent to Congress).  There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals ""alive,"" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.  Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden ""under the carpet.""  As a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of ""patriotism.""  The only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.  As for the end where it states that: ""The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.""  That should be ""...to fight the rebel colonists,"" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each, of the total colonist populace.  In short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.

It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey. I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost. But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions. Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well. Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums.

It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops. Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City. The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war. James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate.

What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.  Jeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington's troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.  This film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington's command is well done. The state of mind of Washington's troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.

The ""Indian Wars"" of the US empire continue as this film on the oppression of Guatemalan Mayan Indians reveals.  While President Clinton did offer a near-apology for our decades of funding and organizing Guatemala's dirty war that killed 200,000 people, our corporatocracy continues to exploit the region and to wage economic warfare via NAFTA, CAFTA and the World Bank.  ""Men With Guns"" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.  This film offers us a tool to raise awareness, and civic groups like Global Exchange and Madre offer us opportunities to act in solidarity with the victims of US foreign policy.

He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a ""liberation priest"" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are ""informed"" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation.

What, exactly is going on politically in South America?  Where does individual responsibility lie? What does helping people really mean?  What kind of legacy is it possible to leave?  The setting of this movie is an unnamed country in South America. The writer/director, John Sayles, did this on purpose.  This is to show that the kind of thing depicted in the movie could happen anywhere.  However, it was shot in Mexico, in Spanish, with English subtitles. The movie starts Federico Luppi as Dr. Humberto Fuentes, a wealthy doctor who is approaching retirement and has never paid close attention to the realities of his country.  His greatest achievement, the ""legacy"" he is leaving, is his participation in an international health program in which he trained young doctors to work in the poorest of villages. I watched this movie with horror and then, finally, resignation, as Dr. Fuentes travels in the mountains and makes startling discoveries.  I made a few startling discoveries myself -- the abject poverty of the people, the disregard for human life, the acceptance by the people of this as a way of life.  He finds that the people have no food.  He finds that both the army and the guerillas are equally brutal.  The movie takes us all on a journey with Dr. Fuentes.

It's best not to think too strongly about the feasibility of the plot or the action but simply sit back and enjoy the violence, action, and heroics.  There's plenty of violence of both the good and bad kind as most of the  Secret Service is picked off one by one, some of the staff get killed and a couple throw themselves in front of bullets meant for the President.

Lawhern,"Air Force One (1997) is a relentlessly paced thriller that is still very pertinent to the dilemmas faced (or depending on one's point of view, not faced) by present American leadership in a hostile and ambivalent world.  Though the underlying scenario is a bit outdated (ala 1990s), the themes are still engaging.  Harrison Ford turns in a nuanced and very skilled performance.  He is backed by several other strong actors, including a rather young Glenn Close acting as Vice President.  Liesel Matthews is remarkable as a 12 year old ""first daughter"" and Wendy Crewson is believable as First Lady.  Plotting of the movie isn't perfect.  There are a few loose ends, but I won't spoil viewers' experience by discussing them at length.  Suffice it to say, there are some rather implausible acts by peripheral characters.  But overall, the story holds up well.  As a footnote, I would also add that I cannot imagine any US Presidential candidate in the current group of right wing crazies, panderers and political hacks, taking the public stand that Harrison Ford does as the President in this story.  His ""Be Afraid"" speech and the reasons behind it (""because it's the right thing to do"") are long overdue from the leadership of our country.",Relentlessly Paced Thriller That Entertains Well,1455321600,,,matthew actor skilled air crazy view performance act character relentlessly glenn country back afraid implausible vice wendy ala depend movie speech ambivalent add turn take thriller world perfect footnote young pace discuss group several length thing engage reason force public long leadership candidate hostile outdated hack one nuanced daughter viewer underlie right american point pertinent crewson panderer act plot suffice first liesel bit cannot scenario overdue theme would present hold harrison imagine also close still believable end face presidential ford current dilemma one's experience overall wing story old though include spoil behind president political remarkable well year say strong loose peripheral lady rather stand

In 2023 the new Aircraft that will serve as Air Force One will be a 747-8.  When the last 747 was delivered it was based on a 747-200 at the time it was delivered the 747-400 was being delivered. The 747-8 has the same type rating as the 747-400 they both have no flight engineer. The new Aircraft being used for Air Force One may be modified to have a flight engineers position, because it will undoubtedly have many more systems than a regular 747-8.  It will essentially have a type rating unto itself and its twin(s).  That is, no 747-8 rated pilot would be qualified to fly Air Force One.  Piloting Air Force One is a prestigious job, although it is boring. There are Air Force pilots that don't want the job. Many former Air Force pilots won't work for the Air Lines for the same reason.

This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.  In light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.  The problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.  I'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.  For a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?",The director of Das Boot was a bad choice for such silly material,1437609600,,,give uncommonly he's widescreen hat television embrace know laugh talented campy hard house air play much tongue-in-cheek apparently emmerick's star suspense shot enjoy emmerich way castle suggest das movie approach mcclane john wolfgang script simply know emmerich's movie--would deliriously perfect think concept state action least get nothing high dumb tremendously it--and screenplay take big problem exciting--he direct make force slightly different native ludicrous cliffhanger storm although huge director scene independence fun friends peterson write visuals silly peterson's picture gravity obvious one fact you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening touch whatever technically light make fellow funny possible me--but sense roland material seriously good directs direct lavish dull talk hollywood poseidon light well-made watch time decide commentary mood excite would actual set-pieces pulp practical harrison white andrew cheeky disaster also fan still concepts theater even humor creator easily audience ford day year ridiculous unintentional ultimately choice film countryman i'm incline since comedy die know german without marlowe take seem president eye allow there's old-style assume tone guilt allow past example show another united murder boot manage survive give picture rather review

Brown,"This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a ""star vehicle"" back in Hollywood's Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.  ""Air Force One"" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?  The Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.  Ford mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.  Don't expect a tremendous amount from ""Air Force One."" and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in ""Air Force One"" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can't work with what you don't have.","""Get off my plane!""",1426118400,,,know aboard age track nice phone vicious house washington air hollywood's much use amount star work devise staffer sequence like staff cast movie fly oldman-led likable know turn hero guy mutter completely room action everyone audiences can't rescue many twist negotiate expect hostage faith effect benefit force cgi movie disappoint good golden long less tremendous now-ubiquitous actor put little belly folk course one hellbent face change back make morning reason kind gang predictable adventure vehicle good airplane oldman use dialogue step far-fetched bit plane whether stuff neutralize cell call sole would harrison white bad hijack general situation ahead startle brilliant presidential russian moscow plan else ford year release entertain escape leader pop make great case either process clichd special suspension classic yet story along terrorist look excellent seem president entertain allows well gary always get get difference manages late disbelief may lose deck family he's pretty

What should have been a relaxing trip home, turned out to be a nightmare on a national then global scale. Russian, neo-nationalist terrorists, who wanted their General released from prison, impersonated member's of the media whom they had killed, to be able to board AIR FORCE ONE. These deranged member's of this radical group, relied heavily upon the treachery of one of the U.S. Secret Service Agents who ironically, was assigned to protect the President from just the sort, whom he was now, aiding. And his betrayal to his country, his President and his job assignment was key, to their success. With a hostile take over on the plane and with systematic hostages being executed, what was the U.S. President/The Commander In Chief, going to do? Especially since, the terrorists were demanding that the plane be re-fueled in the air and re-routed, back to Mother Russia. Thinking that the President had evacuated the plane with the emergency escape pod, the psychotic terrorists, called him a ""...coward!"" Not realizing that he was still aboard and was the only hope for the hostages and flight crew, he was secretly trying to communicate with the White House. By now, the sadistic Russian terrorists knew, that there was a mystery passenger on board who was frustrating and resisting them, successfully. The sociopathic saboteurs were being sabotaged. Meanwhile, the Vice President as played by Academy Award winning Actress Glen Close, is told by the Security Council to write the President off, because he has been missing in action and as of yet, they hadn't heard from him. In this fast paced action drama, you will be at the edge of your seat if not on your feet, with plenty of adrenaline pumping through you, cheering for the President. So, riveting is this film. You are either with the terrorists or with the President. For the Americans or for the Russians. For freedom or for tyranny. There is no middle ground with this movie. And the Secret Service Agent who betrayed the United States, the innocent American hostages, the President, his Secret Service colleagues and his job assignment? Does he ever get his...!! How? Well, you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and see. It makes for compelling viewing that will make an American Patriot out of you..., if you aren't one already.

Harrison Ford plays a very determined President.  He's determined no to sit by and do nothing when terrorists destroy other countries; he is determined not to negotiate with terrorists; he is determined to save his family and other hostages when terrorists take over Air Force One; and very determined to get their leader off his ship and tells him so.  After that, he's determined to send as many as possible to safety before the ship breaks apart upon impact with the ocean.  He does accomplish his goals with the help of his cabinet via phone calls or fax machine when he is not dodging bullets in various parts of the plane.  Glen Close plays an equally determined Vice President trying to get all the hostages free and save President and his family.  Gary Oldman plays a terrorist leader who is determined to lead Russia into a new Golden Age of power and glory and plans to undermine the President's new policy of not negotiating with terrorists by threatening to kill his family.   I have always liked Harrison Ford movies and this is a definite keeper to be watched over and over again.  I liked the fact that I could choose to watch it either wide-screen or full-screen.  This is a movie that needs to be seen in wide-screen. All fans of Harrison Ford will undoubtedly like this film of a man determined to live by his convictions, only to be challenged to dig deep to find the strength and courage to do so when the unthinkable happens.

Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism, led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman. The plot is fairly easy to follow, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, who I'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from) once again has an excellent musical score. Even though I do enjoy this film, I do have a couple issues with it: first, I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film, and the script makes him very easy to hate, more with actions and facial expressions. However, he isn't the only character I couldn't stand, Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary, how pathetic, in this case. Aside from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter, some characters don't last long enough to even care about. And in movies like this, you have to know the villian has back-up, unfortunately, that cliche has gotten very old for me, along with the ""kill the witness formula"". All that aside, this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters, both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down) This film however, seemed like a blueprint for those films, even though, obviously, the new ones, seemed a lot more intense. In those films, however, at least with White House Down, the media was as bad as the terrorists!

Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in ""Independence Day."") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make ""Air Force One"" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.  Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard ""Air Force One"" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.  The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot""), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance""), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of ""L.A. Takedown""), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember ""Escape from New York?"") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.  The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, ""Air Force One"" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit ""Executive Decision."" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller ""Passenger 57"" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both ""Airport 75"" and ""Cliffhanger."" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" franchise and the Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" movies. Finally, the ""Air Force One"" ending should come as no surprise to any ""Star Trek"" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although ""Air Force One"" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.  Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between ""Air Force One"" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller ""Das Boot""/""The Boat"" (1981). The casting of ""Das Boot"" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of ""Air Force One"" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in ""Das Boot."" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.  Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his ""Die Hard"" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger,"" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the ""Patriot Games"" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout ""Air Force One"" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in ""The Devil's Own"" (1997).  The real casting coup in ""Air Force One"" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like ""Quantum Leap's"" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, ""Air Force One"" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.",Tightly Knit Thriller Bristles with Suspense Galore,1343433600,,,"soviet gibbs villain slam-bang jack cold performance star refuse shrewdly romance regime service commandeer wreathe york start steven electricity thriller room connect-the-dots swept emerges berkeley chief conveniently shift cannibalize favorite franchise commando certainly stag force later corridor movie surprise independence trigger star emerge bill fictional serviceable despite reluctant zealot tell original qualifies pull appropriate recent suit energetic fly unconventional medal kill tie across guard kazakhstan highly bully would takedown boost everything familiar bad raid rely ruthless late finally presidential receive hit airport melodrama ford tv jet release summer violence idea ultimately show clinton nevertheless petersen special spot plunge constantly run stick set tear meanwhile wimpy entry follow entertain political jones dimension bennett every guy veteran know count dean petersen's coup jurgen away thriller leap agent hard clearly devil's inadequately marshall's character airfield parental open hero plot like cop usurp neck pro-american sub request accord come character hold anybody nothing marlowe's rescue several kremlin negotiate screenplay gun element compensate state obtain storm charisma imitate slip pilot obvious one depth promptly personally secretary new danger smuggle helicopter crew korshunov contact crash predictable woefully one-dimensional appear germany passenger first remember cliffhanger time pulp wildly skyjack marry affiliation visceral helplessly general game maintain fashion laurel mission secure clearance side cataclysmic scene trumpet kathryn object crackle asks mobile refuse r-rated appear style parachute gear pretty die seagal classic intensity old president's german football president figure comparison protagonist saga use three u.s manages clear moreover formula aboard actor half-hour spot schmaltzy play boast week marlow snipe head glenn end fire hi-tech vice decision however lip true stunt cardboard wolfgang generally script knock america's hero vietnam night war radek's upper enough secret stockwell run largely veteran hoosegow camera quantum less although box scene director pack nearly help shed daughter proportion back boot""/""the succeed american rough parallel free james borrow oldman security agility hollywood team far-fetched game affinity take-off occurs watch insomniac prison present escapade radek towel harrison l.a andrew jetliner epic snap leap's authority close palace end stance heinous start wesley heavily russell escape russian make ultra-nationalist sends resemblance willis walter stipulate best ryan typical look throughout marshall body stiff clutch assume happen gary another harrow boot bruce politician defense evidently unless disgruntle indiana fill air gear way men u-boat da movie news patriot boat add guys world kurt action impartially pullman's mode office executive aid hostage siege bogus presumably careen adversarial real sketch trek wife ejects unlike early melodramatic threatens thrives prochnow innovation honor hoop airborne pod anti-terrorist sharp distracted predicament headstrong opus spate truly male machine lack recognize plane neat villain hilary tenacious learn die incarcerated kill fantastic courage impale filmmaker tumble walk hijack russian matter moscow day dexterity basically cast identify vow leader flame bring elite occur slug terrorist dot adversary xander keep blockbuster party make abduct hull ivan throw keep ford's feature"

Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union. Key to their plans is the release of their favorite general from Russian prison. One clue -- just one -- to the whole thing is pretty clear early on in the highjacking: one of the Secret Service agents guarding the president is helping the terrorists.  The leader of the terrorist highjackers is Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) who is clearly insane, and has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.

It's the kind of action movie where you can suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy. And at the same time this film depicts a President that many of us really wish we actually had in the Oval Office: a politician who can literally kick some ass. Harrison Ford demonstrates that he is still a really good action hero, and is also a great actor. That acting talent goes for the opposite side of the coin in Gary Oldman. Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.  After the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. ""It's your turn to live in fear,"" he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.  Air Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.  It turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is up to him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.  These kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: ""You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?"" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.  Wolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.  As I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment.

Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly!

Although Kevin Costner was originally in mind to play the President, it would be hard to imagine anyone better suited to this role at the time, than Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones).  President James Marshall (Ford) is returning from the Soviet Union, travelling with his staff and family on Air Force One, the President's custom modified 747.  While in flight, terrorists disguised as journalists, take over the plane, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldham).  Secret service agents rush the President to the escape pod in the lower section of the plane.  The pod is launched, so the terrorists believe that the President has escaped, but he remains hidden aboard.  Back in Washington, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), is in charge of the negotiations with Korshunov, who is demanding the release of General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a criminal being held in a Soviet prison.  US fighters arrive to escort AF1.  As the Government works to recover the pod, Korshunov begins to execute hostages.  The President communicates with Washington via satellite phone, restating his policy of non-negotiation with terrorists.  This signals Marshall's transition from Commander In Chief, to chief buttkicker.  Finishing as one of the top five grossing films of 1997, AF1 is a classic late 90's mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.  With a huge budget, big stars, special effects, and tons of studio backing, it is Grade A entertainment for the masses, where lovable action hero type, Harrison Ford, dons a superhero cape, and against impossible odds, Marshall saves the day.  For the film's key element, the producers researched the real AF1, as much as they could, but much about the craft remained classified.  Within that pseudo-realistic framework however, reality is seriously mangled, as Marshall travels with relative ease, and the hull is never breached by a bullet.  The terrorists are terribly inefficient, failing to take immediate control of the cockpit, and letting the President escape.  Oldman's Korshunov, is quite the patriot, when threatening women and a child, but isn't much as commander of men.  The cast also includes William H. Macy (Sahara), Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkley, Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap), Liesel Mathews (A Little Princess), and Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot).  Wolfgang Petersen is a storyteller, that understands the effective use of action, and he provides an enthusiastic, and informative commentary.  He marvels at the amazing things that were done in the special effects department, which by today's standards, appear quite dated.  Air Force One is an overdramatic, pretentious, but fun fantasy, with a patriotic streak.  It is too bad that today's real problems can't be dealt with so simply.","faint threads to reality, as the US's Marshall defends freedom . . .",1273363200,,,soviet aboard deal dean hold via mangle jurgen phone date hard indiana washington air woman macy much paul marshall's ease use quite return storyteller focus glenn demanding remain satellite modify criminal fire informative element staff vice men wendy leap das overdramatic policy however service cast launch wolfgang section costner edge custom blockbuster commander could classify patriot princess hero simply thriller william action reality chief problem can't suit travel csi anyone within secret stockwell take effect big ton understand force marvel terribly amaze budget research real oldman's immediate pseudo-realistic threatening well quantum although escaped provide buttkicker huge director line fun star little guilfoyle charge lovable thing bill one grade play prochnow mathews film's remain inefficient role back pod subject cockpit finish korshunov journalist crewson cape patriotic arrive believe seriously film james mass let type child hollywood liesel disguise plane signal studio fail lead escort government time transition streak mind commentary flight prison travel would return rush radek imagine execute harrison top entertainment pretentious odds general also bad close key cooperation non-negotiation standard work five today's recover effective ford day release fighter communicate escape save hide sahara kevin agent kathryn clinton producer never breach petersen fantasy film special appear berkley bullet hostage classic president's terrorist department union xander superhero include life mainstream back marshall impossible president craft previously originally jones negotiation gary gross hull control ivan enthusiastic do restate bennett late boot personal oldham lower family begin relative framework don support

2411,2411,5,True,"02 4, 2010",A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,0767803434,{'Format:': ' Blu-ray'},Jimmy Lee,"It still never ceases to amaze me how this high-spirited action-packed gem escaped me for all these years. My earliest recollection of this film is when I was still in grammar school catching the trailer's most infamous and notorious Harrison Ford moment when he quotes, ""Get off my plane""!. (Priceless) Now, after all of these years have passed I can at least say that this film did not disappoint as the solid acting and fast paced action held my attention throughout the film in it's entirety. Upon viewing this film in the Blu-Ray format it made me regret not seeing it in theaters in a sense. On a more positive note, this blu-ray disc truly utilizes it's full potential of technology; moreover, it's patriotic epic score composed by the one and only Jerry GoldSmith which is also accompanied by a great sounding lossless audio track will really satisfy the home theater buffs. On an even more positive note, I feel this Blu-Ray disc was not far off or short for that in matter in delivering a true realistic theater experience because it was quite superb on many levels. I will elaborate more on these technical specs later but for now I will give a very brief summary here.  President Marshall, played by a more youthful looking and middle-aged (Harrison Ford) is held hostage along with his family and staff members on Air Force One after American Special Forces capture general Rodek who is the leader of Kazakhstan. President Marshall leaves a gorgeous and enormous looking Moscow dinner hall after delivering a very brief subdued and yet powerful speech concerning terrorism and foreign policy. Upon boarding the plane we are introduced with Ivan Korshunov who is played by the versatile and ever so impressive (Gary Oldman) While Air Force One is in flight, the audience discovers a mole in the secret service that is able to board Ivan and his other supportive terrorists companions. The secret service wastes no time in starting the bloodshed as he fires two bullets into two cabinet member's heads while they were discussing and briefing on important foreign policy matters. Soon the trails of a smoke grenade released by the secret service man signal Ivan and his ultra radical friends to unleash hell on the president and everyone else on the plane; and, that is exactly what they do because they are incredibly vengeful, bitter and quite keen on releasing General Radek.  Since we are dealing with Blu-Ray technology I always feel it is appropriate and mandatory to analyze and review the technical specs because that is what we are paying top exorbitant dollar for right? If we weren't receiving an upgrade we might as well be buying VHS right?  Well I am astounded to announce that, Blu-Ray fans won't be disappointed in this department either because the picture and sound looks and feels incredibly sharp, precise and most importantly very consistent. Despite the film's age, this disc completely revives and revamps it to a more recent looking film even with the sparse and light 90's grain subtlety prevalent throughout. Fortunately, this minor set back hardly retracts or dilutes any of the overall quality of this pristine transfer. More importantly, flesh tones are smooth and detailed throughout; hair and fabric emit some fine detail particularly in the darker interior shots of the control panel sequences. The blue colored control panel scenes are quite remarkable in the sense that it really enhances facial hair and flesh tone depth to a more elevated level of clarity in any parts of the film. Personally, no other scene compares to this high level of detail in my opinion. This attribute is more specifically shown when Gary Oldman is losing his patience when he frustratingly articulates his demands to the vice president with impunity and anger. Apart from the control panel scenes, the rest of the film does not fail to deliver in expressing some vibrantly smooth scenes in the conference rooms, bag storage area as well as the smaller private rooms (Bathroom, lounge rooms). The majority of the film takes place in the interior of the plane during the night with some interwoven scenes of the white house conference rooms so you will have to keep this in mind in order to regulate any misguided expectations. (In terms of settings, not an entire amount of variety here)  The Sound is excellent, as the flawless lossless 5.1 audio will give all your speakers quite a bit of attention; the dialogue is crisp, articulate, clean and very pleasing. I was able to make out every spoken word without any complications. You will truly appreciate the opening-firing scene at the headquarters in Kazakhstan when general Rodek is captured. Moreover, AK-47's, Mp5 and Mp5k's fire and pierce with unbelievable force and dominance, but that's not even the bread and butter here folks. The automatic sub-machine guns truly immerse you in its breath taking firepower during the first plane shootout when the terrorists kill the majority of the President's staff on board. Listen carefully to the bullets ricocheting off metal stairs or penetrating through bathroom doors. I fully appreciated the gunfire sounds in the bag storage area where President Marshall hides; it is quite impressive and mesmerizing actually. One will also quickly observe how much attention is given to the sub-woofer and rear channel speakers during the exterior night shots of the plane in fight; engines will roar loudly and thoroughly producing a strong vibration in any floor of your house. As a result, this creates a very strong acoustical sound range leading the front channel speakers and gradually dissolving to the rear. The introduction of the F-16 fighter jets following Air Force One leaves no speaker unscathed; the incessant accelerating engine power might cause one to grip on to their seats. (Well, at lease for me it did) These types of aerial vehicular sounds are nicely calculated in between scenes of dialogue and dominate the last half-hour of the film. Even though I have never seen this film on standard dvd I feel it is appropriate and safe to say that this is a serious upgrade for home theater fans. Although I wouldn't say this is an outstanding Blu-Ray film, I will say it is a solid one because it delights and pleases wherever possible. In that regard, it is worth the purchase.  In regards to the acting, Harrison Ford Fans or in my case die-hard Gary Oldman fans will be impressed here. A multi-talented and quite younger Gary Oldman emits a more vengeful and retrained type of villain here as opposed to some of the former impulsive, unbalanced psychotic characters he plays. His anger is explosive and expected when provoked and his calmness is professional when in control; he practically has zero empathy for anyone on board as he kills relentlessly with his crew. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, plays a very likeable president; his assertiveness and confidence in times of panic and danger will definitely satisfy his plausibility as an authority figure as well as a favorable president. Besides the main actors, Glenn Close ( The Vice president) along with William H. Macy and Wendy Crewson (the first lady) are serviceable to say the very least.  In conclusion, Air Force One will definitely please most fans of far-fetched action packed high explosive films while simultaneously satisfying the technical crowd who thoroughly enjoy seeing their films being treated in a careful and respectful manner.","Adrenaline Inducing?

Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.  Like a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.  Still, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.

And there's Sir Roger Moore as the Girl's All-Highest Manager, kidding his own James Bond image. Though I'd agree with other reviewers that the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" take-off is perhaps a bit much. Is this to show how the appeal of the Spice Girls is truly ""universal""  or something?  The Spice Girls themselves are sporting enough to put themselves through any sort of gag. They always kid themselves and each other and preach ""Gil Powah,"" while Posh herself already shows her interest in clothes. And of course they sing their greatest hits, which aren't too bad, though the lyrics being subtitled means you could risk having those syrupy-sweet songs being stuck in your head for some time.

2425,2425,5,False,"06 3, 2009",A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767803434,{'Format:': ' Blu-ray'},Dennis A. Amith,"In the Summer of 1997, audiences were treated with another action film from Harrison Ford.  During the 1990's, Ford has made quite a number of successful action films but his performance in ""AIR FORCE ONE"" was truly an example that this Hollywood veteran still had what it takes to be an action star.  The film was directed by well-known action director Wolfgang Petersen (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Troy"", ""Outbreak"", ""Das Boot""), music by well-known composer Jerry Goldsmith (""Rambo"", ""Star Trek: First Contact"", ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"",  ""Basic Instinct"") and Director of Photography by Michael Ballhaus (""Gangs of New York"", ""The Departed"", ""Wild Wild West"").  The film was received positively by critics and a success in the box office as it brought in over $315 million worldwide.  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" even received attention from President Bill Clinton who enjoyed the film and watched it twice.  The film would go on to receive two Academy Award nominations for ""Best Film Editing"" and ""Best Sound"".  VIDEO & AUDIO:  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" features a pretty solid transfer on Blu-ray.  Video is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:40:1) and one thing that I will make clear is that while many films featured in the 90's tend to have a DNR, clean, waxy or soft effect in terms of picture quality, the good news is that ""AIR FORCE ONE"" does not.  In fact, there are scenes where the detail comes out quite nicely.  But if there was one thing that the Blu-ray High Definition transfer does happen to bring out is the amount of grain.  But I would rather take a transfer full of grain than the soft, waxy DNR look any day.  And I am so happy that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment decided to feature ""AIR FORCE ONE"" with a good HD transfer of the film.  As for the audio, I have one word and that is ""magnificent"".  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" has one of the most impressive soundtracks that I have heard from a 1990's film.  The soundtrack just sounds absolutely wonderful on English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (the film is also featured in French Dolby TrueHD 5.1).  The film features a high number of action scenes and gunfire, music, mechanical sounds from the vehicles, jet engines flying, helicopter rotors spinning, it would seem that so much was put into the emphasis of having a wonderful soundtrack that ""AIR FORCE ONE"" truly delivers. And these are not short bursts of audio, there are plenty of scenes that utilize this explosive audio throughout the film.  I was absolutely in awe of how all the speakers were being utilized, especially my surround channels  and I also noticed a few times where my subwoofer would utilize low frequency sounds.  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is an action thriller that truly delivers with its audio that I can say that this is one of the better sounding action thrillers from the 1990's that just shines on Blu-ray.  And just to think that this film is 12 years old.  I was absolutely thrilled by the audio quality of the film.  As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.  SPECIAL FEATURES:  ""AIR FORCE ONE"" features a commentary track by Director Wolfgang Petersen and Michael Coleman.  This is the same commentary from the DVD release but there is good information from Petersen on scenes that were actual aerial shots and not CG and which parts were shot on a set and were CG'd.  Also, learning about his feelings towards his cast members, Harrison Ford especially and how Ford did his own stunt work.  BD Live is also enabled and there are commercials in 1080p for upcoming releases from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  JUDGMENT CALL:  I am a big Harrison Ford fan and I watched this film immediately when it came out on theaters.  My first impression was that Harrison Ford should definitely be President because it was like a combination of a President meets DIE HARD's John McClane.  Well, not really but Harrison Ford's role as a President who fights back was definitely a highlight throughout the film.  One thing that I know is when a film is being directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the viewer is definitely going to be treated with an exceptional, action-packed film and ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is just that.  Even 12 years later and this film still holds up quite well.  Petersen and everyone involved in this film did a wonderful job and I have to say that this is my favorite Harrison Ford action thriller to come out in the 1990's.  He manages to have the suave, charisma and that look and feel of an action star but in this case, he's the President of the United States.  But for those who own the DVD of ""AIR FORCE ONE"", you may be wondering if its worth the double dip?  I have to answer with an extreme ""YES!!!"".  The soundtrack of ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is top notch and I will say that its one of the most immersive soundtracks I have heard on Blu-ray.  Also, bare in mind, this is not a new action film, this was a film released in the Summer of 1997 and it can compete with some of the recent, bigger releases on Blu-ray.  That is how magnificent this film sounds on Blu-ray.  If there were faults in the Blu-ray transfer, its the fact that there are not many special features included.  Just the audio commentary but no HD trailer and no making of featurette.  The other thing is that although the film looks better than many 1990's film on Blu-ray and avoids the waxy, DNR look but with its HD transfer, grain is elevated.  Though not too bad, it is noticeable and this may be a slight issue for some viewers but I tend to be on side of grain is part of film and high definition elevates the look of grain.  And personally, I would rather take the grain than a transfer with a lot of DNR or edge enhancement.  Overall, ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is a magnificent action-packed thriller and a film that Harrison Ford truly shines in.  And as for the Blu-ray, this is the definitive version of ""AIR FORCE ONE"" to own!","Blu-ray: ""AIR FORCE ONE"" is an audiophile's dream!  Incredible lossless audio!

It gives us the president of our dreams, a president of mythic virtues, and then shows him desperately at risk.  The catch is that the audience must believe that it's watching the president of the United States. Buy it, and ``Air Force One,'' now out on video, is halfway home. Don't buy it, and the film becomes a preposterous thriller.  Fortunately, the film finds in Harrison Ford the one actor who can fully inhabit two kinds of grandeur -- action-movie bigness and the aura of the presidency. He has the ego and the intelligence for the job. He has the Gary Hart hair. He also has a quality that Americans perhaps are nostalgic for -- sincerity.  As President James Marshall, Ford is beyond sincere. He is an impassioned visionary. We meet him for the first time at a Kremlin banquet in his honor, giving a speech in which he's about to implode with rage and moral fervor. ``It's your turn to be afraid!'' he warns terrorists. By the time Gary Oldman, as an obsessed Kazak super-nationalist, and his band of Communist mal contents hijack the president's Boeing 747, the act seems like a chilling violation.  There's a violence to ``Air Force One'' that's simply not present in the more cartoonish action films. Bullets rip nasty holes into doors, and the sound of gunshots in the confined space of the presidential plane is a jolt. Oldman's enjoyment in murdering defenseless people makes the violence more personal and frightening. Director Wolfgang Petersen's action fantasy escalates into midair dogfights and elaborate stunts that have people dangling from the Air Force One parachute ramp and later trying to transfer via a cable to a rescue aircraft. There is a tone of confident military heroics and almost a reverence for the presidency that seem a throwback to World War II propaganda movies. ``Air Force One'' might not be the role of Ford's career, but it might be the ultimate role of his maturity.",Just saw it again.

The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.  Despite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed.

It's an amazing film, and I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat, talking (yes, I was) to the TV, saying ""don't do that"" and other such nonsense.  I've never been a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm not sure why. Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.  My problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.  I did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.  This soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being ""too loud and blatty."" Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.

While admittedly *today* in real life there would be intense security to prevent this from happening, it seems a highly plausible plot for a film, especially in 1997 when it was made. The world sat in disbelief when it was announced at a TV  press conference that Kazakhstan terrorists hold the U.S. President James Marshall, delegates, and various family members as hostages up on Air Force One not long after boarding the plane in Russsia. Communications between Glenn Close, the U.S. Vice President, a prisoner on Air Force One and the U.S. Press Secretary in Washington confirmed their status ...  Harrison Ford plays the U.S. President with fearlessness and cunning. He also demonstrates superb hand-to-hand fighting skills plus superior technical expertise with a gun. He becomes the hero who manages to elude the terrorists when he remains one level below, as they overtake the pilot and copilot. He creates diversions and thwarts their various plans, all the while evading detection. Initially, they are unaware whom they are fighting. Once Ivan Korshunov, the leader, realizes it is the President of the United States who nearly single-handedly prevents them from achieving their goals, the terrorist becomes more vicious. He threatens the wife of the President at gun point and turns on the loudspeaker so the President can listen as she voices her fears. This enrages the President who takes even more serious measures to save their lives: he dumps fuel to force them to stop. The fighting scenes are unparalleled yet eventually Harrison Ford is captured. The capture of the President forces the United States to negotiate with the terrorists, despite their policy against doing so. The terrorists want the release of General Alexander Radek, the former ruler of Kazakhstan ...  The rescue of the President, delegates and their families is breath-taking. Fortunately, some manage to jump with parachutes but there are not enough and time is running out ... Air Force One does not have the ability to land. There is a daring awe-inspiring rescue up in the air at 15,000 feet. General Alexander Radek is released from his prison cell, dressed in his well-decorated uniform as he walks across the prison courtyard ... and in the end, justice prevails.

(2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.)  Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another.  K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER?  Dead in the water.  HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE?  Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves.  RANDOM HEARTS?  When you look up ""catastrophe"" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie.  SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS?  Awful.  WATER TO WINE (2004)?  Even his fans don't know what it is!  I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.  So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97.  The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time.  Reactionary?  No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit ""24,"" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE.  And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.  Most of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now.  He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.  AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.

In Air Force One, Ford plays the role of President of the United States. In the same way that it's near impossible to envision any other actor in the role of Indiana Jones, it's difficult to envision anyone else as president for this film. Ford projects the image of such a strong, honorable, and likeable leader that the audience is immediately rooting for him.  Originally released in 1997, Ford plays President James Marshall, a Vietnam vet turned president who makes it clear in a stunning speech at a Moscow dinner that America will now pursue a ""zero tolerance"" policy on international terrorism (sound familiar?). Boarding Air Force One for the return flight home from Moscow, Marshall is joined by his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and his daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). He's also joined by a contingent of Eastern European journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).  Unbeknownst to the President and his fellow Air Force One passengers, the group of men aren't journalists at all, but instead an elite team of terrorists bent on taking the president hostage. With a Secret Service agent (Xander Berkeley) collaborating with the terrorists, Korshunov has intimate inside knowledge of the procedures and safeguards deployed to protect the president on Air Force One. When Secret Agent Gibbs (Berkeley) opens the onboard weapons cache of Air Force One, his terrorist friends carry out a methodic plan to eliminate the president's security circle.  At the sound of gunfire, President Marshall is hurriedly raced below deck to an escape pod so as to avoid his capture. With the pod jettisoned, Korshunov is enraged that the original plan failed. But his original goal remains intact, and the terrorist decides that the president's family and the remaining passengers will make do as hostages. Negotiating with the acting Vice President (Glenn Close) in the President's absence, Korshunov demands the release of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a communist hardliner who Korshunov believes will bring back the Soviet Union and restore the intoxicating glory of its empire years. With a well laid and executed plan, Korshunov's demands are met and arrangements are made to release General Radek. But what Korshunov doesn't know is that President Marshall is still onboard, having jettisoned an empty escape pod, and he's intent on freeing his family and kicking the terrorists off his plane...  Filled with action and some memorable one-liners, Air Force One is a classic Harrison Ford action thriller along the lines of Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger. In addition, prior to filming Air Force One, the producers were given unprecedented access to the real thing. The result is a film that displays the inner sanctums of Air Force One with stunning accuracy, providing the audience with a glimpse into the actual traveling life of the most powerful man in the world.

On his way home from Russia, after his remarkable pronouncement, Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).  They are determined to win the freedom of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a military leader who murdered thousands of people in his bid for power.  The secret service agents on the plane sacrificed themselves to get the President into the escape pod in the belly of the plane, leaving the President's closest advisors, as well as his wife and daughter, at the mercy of the terrorists... Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) immediately tries to negotiate with the terrorists to get the hostages off the plane alive while the military follows the beacon to the president's escape pod.  Everything changes when the escape pod is found - empty.  President James Marshall never left the plane and he is determined to make the terrorists pay.  However, the terrorists quickly notice that their numbers are dwindling and assume that there is a secret service agent loose on the plane.  They begin killing hostages in the hopes that they will find one that matters enough to the unknown man for him to give himself up.  With the clock ticking and increasing numbers of hostages being murdered, President Marshall soon finds that he is forced into negotiating with the terrorists and arranging for the release of General Radek from prison.  But that doesn't mean that he is beaten as he uses every trick in the book to get the terrorists off his plane... Air Force One is a great movie.

Co-starring Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Liesel Matthews, William H. Macy, and Dean Stockwell, Air Force One's premise is simple: Russian ultra-Communist terrorists take over the President's plane on its way back to the U.S. from Moscow.  Marshall, who by happenstance is separated from his family and staff during the takeover, must use his military training (he's a former Air Force pilot) and his wits to regain control of Air Force One and rescue the hostages before the terrorists achieve their aims. The terrorists, led by Ivan Korshunov (Oldman), are seeking the immediate release of General Alexander Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), who was snatched from his palace in Kazakhstan by a joint team of Russian and American Special Forces.  Radek and his followers believe in the restoration of the old Soviet Union, and until both Russia and the U.S. intervened, had ruled Kazakhstan with as much regard for human life as the Taliban exhibited when they ruled Afghanistan.  After a ceremony hosted by the grateful Russian President in which Marshall warns rogue nations and terrorists that ""we will no longer be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid,"" the American delegation heads to one of Moscow's main airports to board the Presidential plane. Little do they know that Korshunov and his team, using falsified press credentials, have passed through both Russian and American security and are aboard.  Ironically, they are given a tour of Air Force One by the unsuspecting assistant press secretary, Melanie Mitchell  (Donna Bullock). And why not? To the Secret Service agents and the Air Force Security detachment, Korshunov and his people are reporters, harmless and unarmed. So how in the world are these guys going to storm Air Force One, ""the most secure aircraft in the world?""  Hmmm....and why do Korshunov and Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) exchange that glance as they pass each other, eh? Petersen and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe never do explain Gibbs' motivations for his subsequent actions (as the director admits in the audio commentary track), but by the time audiences start asking those ""real life"" questions about plausibility, the sheer adrenaline rush provided by this action-packed film suppresses the ""yeah, right"" response to its premise.  The Air Force (which willingly participated in the production of this film) says there is no escape pod in Air Force One's list of defensive measures, and viewers know that no sane person, whether terrorist or not, is going to fire automatic weapons inside an airborne plane unless he or she knew the mission was going to fail anyway. Mixed in with the gunfire and explosions that punctuate the film, Petersen and Marlowe endow their characters with depth and believability.  Petersen makes viewers care about each person being held hostage, warts and all, so that when one is lost,  it feels real.  Even Korshunov is played in such way that his motivations feel true and heartfelt, even if his cause is not just. Yet Petersen and his cast and crew make audiences forget these dull real life facts.

At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question. Let's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default. Apart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public. I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk.

The multi-talented Gary Oldman (Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula,"" ""The Contender"") is in his element as the thoroughly and dastardly evil leader of the terrorist group, and the incomparable Glenn Close is riveting as the loyal Vice President who refuses to grab the reigns of power as long as her president stays alive. But Close's bigger contribution is her unparalled ability to convey her character's sense of subdued panic while maintaining calm as an uncertain nation looks on. Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") has come up with a terrific nail-biter despite a couple of stretches of imagination.

America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from evil again.

But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps.

You can chalk this one up as another success for superstar Harrison Ford and director Wolfgang Peterson, who's consistently been one of the better action filmmakers around. Ford stars as James Marshall, the president of the United States. He and his cabinet have just recently made the crucial decision to go after a renegade general named Radek, who threatens to bring back a state of communism to Russia. The mission to capture him is a success, but not long after Marshall and his family board Air Force One on a flight back to the U.S., Russian terrorists posing as newsreporters take over the flight, complete with machine guns and heavy weaponry. Their demands: to have Radek released or else a hostage (50 total) will be executed every half-hour. You can guess where things go from there, as Marshall remains hidden in the cargo area, ready to take back the plane and save his family. Despite an occasionally ridiculous story and quite a few implausibilities, Air Force One never fails to work as a nail-biting actioner. The suspense is palpable, thanks to likeable characters and hissable villains.  There's also the sense of iminent danger and gutsy unpredictability that director Peterson infuses the film with. Hostages are killed every half-hour, and perhaps even those you expect to live through the situation are killed off pretty quickly; the terrorists are not the slightest bit unflinching or unwavering, making for effective villains. I've heard a lot of complaints about the seemingly never-ending conclusion, but for me, it just made the film that much more an unpredictable roller coaster ride, with one edge-of-the-seat situation after another. The action sequences are the ""requisite"" shootouts and fistfights, but are truly exciting, and the fact that this is all set on board the world's most famous aircraft adds frantic urgency to the proceedings. There are also a lot of fantastic stunts, the most thrilling one featuring Ford dangling in mid-air, being reeled inside an aircraft with a cable and strap. Harrison Ford has one of the most commanding presences of any Hollywood actor, and Air Force One is almost entirely his show. Yeah, James Marshall may be too damn perfect for a politician, but this is a red-blooded action flick, and I want a hero that I can unabashedly cheer for from beginning to end, and Marshall is just that kind of guy. Gary Oldman's the villian, and in true Oldman style, you can expect lots of hollering in a somewhat unintelligible accent (which honestly doesn't sound particularly Russian, as it's meant to). Jerry Goldsmith's score is excellent, giving the film an additional intensity, and even revving up excitement during the quieter moments. The main theme is a bit overly patriotic, but undeniably rousing.  Hard to say, but this is probably the famed composer's best score since Rudy. Aside from the logical flaws in the story, the only time the film really stumbles is in the visual effects category. Don't get me wrong, most of the CGI is superb, but there's at least one scene near the end that features probably the most hilariously unconvincing (and disappointing) CGI-rendered shot I've ever seen in a big-studio production. Air Force One may be a little silly and implausible, but it's irony-absent presentation is refreshing in a time when just about every other film out there is trying to be as annoyingly sarcastic as possible.

Ford portrays President James Marshall, who has just given a speech decrying international terrorism and warning those that would use terrorism for political purpose, ""Your day is over.""  But when a truly despicable Russian national (Gary Oldman) and his men forcibly take over the President's plane, holding not only his staff, but even more importantly his wife and daughter, as hostages, Ford is forced to take matters into his own hands.  The result is not always plausible, and some of the special effects don't work quite as well as they should, but one cannot fault the film's pace or the tension and excitement inherent in the story. Ever since playing Han Solo in STAR WARS and Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Ford has developed into a leading man of the action genre--the thinking man's action hero.  That aspect blossomed in PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and, especially THE FUGITIVE; and here in AIR FORCE ONE he gets to play the most important man in the world.  He does it with considerable style.  Glenn Close was also a cagey choice to play the first female vice-president, and she does this with incredible fortitude.  William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell are equally fine in supporting roles as part of the President's staff.  And Oldman, whose performance as Oswald in Oliver Stone's JFK was a miracle performance, is equally superlative as the villain, matching the Bruce Willis/Alan Rickman pairing in DIE HARD. Petersen's direction, despite some missteps, never allowed the film to sag; and Jerry Goldsmith's music score is appropriately patriotic without being sickeningly so, and always suspense-building.  This is a film well worth watching.

Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but ""Spice World"" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.  I might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.  But there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to ""Family Guy"".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.  Just to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in ""Pulp Fiction"" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.  Again, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.

It's all over now until they start to run low again on funds, but with their tour came a re-release of Spice World, the movie. Now I can honestly say, this film is no classic. But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.  The story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled. Basically every plot they could think about they threw in.  I was a Spice Girls fan. I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do. This was done before Geri went skinny, blonder, and didn't want to be known as a former Spice Girl. Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.  There's a whole host of famous British faces in this. Gary Glitter was supposed to have a cameo, but that was quickly cut from the film when he was arrested.

Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.  Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.  Since the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.  While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.  With brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.  - Mike Massie",Spice World Movie Review,1196208000,3.0,,villain scatter eccentric personality brief monstrosity onto suggest nonsensical project cast talent blatant bus wholeheartedly chief countless interior we're song stage really evildoers despite success try far translate riddle struggle halliwell caress familiar bad paste vehicle late desperately envision idea constant either couch support diehard meanwhile alan self-respect apparent entertain go animal they're dance grossly away choreograph footage hard baby clearly much attitude drive unconscious enjoy scenario like pitch scary practice turn character beatles segment everyone can't group finger manager obnoxious england zip pier element brown party obtain elton arise embodies long unfortunately pair obvious hoskins embarrassingly girl debatable posh snap similarly day attempt bunton moore various top pointless still attention inside cuthbertson-smyth snapping ginger slew characteristic span cameos revives physique since comedy yet story though girl inaccuracy spy save realism stroke chisholm picture film sporty relief executive appearance recognize furry sequence cumming red lip-syncing kid five-girl true john spice ripoff instructor carry create night victoria excuse furniture poor enough take big everyday act largely fan flashing music emma naturally play nearly little brits set squeal daydream sense unexciting fashion situation adventure james farce documentarian entertainment concept ditzy paparazzi cahoot man all-girl make watching equipment speedboat look life throughout beckham physically get capable member painful prepare apparently mysterious quite way bovine movie add exploit world roger stereotypical paycheck abandon sick absence pick feel speak starter shot fivesome fact window army popular script bob responsible pretend beyond reach bond sing large dialogue geri workout light studio intend fail sneak blue hold well-known filmmaker sort choreography even bed humor headline easy else basically impossibly lack unable around mike massie universally famous essentially bits melanie show

Sorry, there just isn't one. Well, nothing that could be coherently described as a plot, anyway.

He wanders about with his moronic crew, bumping into things and falling over a lot.  A spitulous newspaper mogul, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphreys) whose goal is to break up the Spice Girls so that he can sell more newspapers, and his associated super sleazy press photographer.  An impotent, stressed out manager - Clifford (Richard E. Grant).  A bizarre quoter of nonsense played by Roger Moore who is supposedly the big Chief.  A very pregnant friend of the Spice Girls who goes into labour whilst dancing at a nightclub.  A movie producer (George Wendt)and writer following Clifford around pitching Spice Girl movie ideas at him which he keeps rejecting until, surprise, surprise, they pitch the idea for this movie to him, and he agrees.  Aliens that have heard of the Spice Girls and want their autographs (whilst they are in the bush looking for a place to pee). I'm not making this one up, honestly.

Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In ""Spice World,"" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie. Funny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls ""interact"" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the ""telly"" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip. Alan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well. The only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.

The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two. The primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic. One credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.

To which Emma successfully suggests, ""why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?""  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus. They seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the ""Saturday Night Divas"" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other. There are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment. There are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders. I doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  ""The drummer without sticks has no backbeat.""  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  ""I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that.""  Hint:  his last hit single. The performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  ""Too Much"", ""Do It"", ""Say You Will Be There"", ""Mama"", ""Denying"", ""Saturday Night Divas"", ""Stop"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Leader Of The Gang"", ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""My Boy Lollipop"", ""Wannabe"", ""Viva Forever"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Spice Up Your Life"", and ""The Lady Is A Vamp.""

Directed by television veteran Bob Spiers (""Ab Fab""), the movie  focuses on the girls during a few days in their hectic life, as they  prepare for their big gig at Royal Albet Hall in London. The movie's  camp factor helps in boosting the film's appeal with teenagers and  pop-culture fans, and although the acting is not that great, the film gives  us many hilarious scenarios including a Mission Impossible-based fantasy  called ""Spice Force 5,"" and an enjoyable photo shoot where the  girls imitate major pop icons of the past and themselves. The songs from  the band's first two albums provide the film's soundtrack with a diverse  selection of tunes that keeps the film together. I only wished that  producers released a compilation album of the band's songs that were  remixed for this film (""Who do You Think You Are"" sounds wicked  in a techno beat). The film's other highlight includes multiple cameo  appearances by such personalities as Sir Elton John, Bob Geldof, Meatloaf,  Bob Hoskins, Roger Moore, George Wendt, and one of the actress from the  ""Ab Fab"" series. All give wonderful comic performances. The  film's worst scene involves the girls' encounter with aliens during a  midnight hike in the woods.

Well his good natured partner (you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down.

There is lots of 'wet' in NO MERCY. By the way, Gere must have been a difficult 'act' to work with because he and Debra Winger were at odds in Officer and a Gentleman, and there was a variety of production problems in Coppola'a ""The Cotton Club"" (as the story goes).  I'd assume Gere had something to do with that too. But, all that said, NO MERCY has a great look that begins in a pretty dreary Chicago and the gritty look does not change when locales change.. Gere is the aggressive Chicago cop who goes undercover and discovers somebody wants to hire him for a 'hit' on a no doubt about it ruthless New Orleans 'business' man with the gorgeous blonde, Cajun girl who was basically 'sold' to the 'Narlins scum by her own mother when she was 13. Gere is always good as the wild card cop and/or loner type, and he will do just about anything to find the murder witness (Basinger).  Could she be involved more than we know?  Well, the race to the conclusion may be visible from an hour away but the ride is entertaining enough with the attractive leads in good form (Basinger really does do that ""shaking rage, so tired of being pushed around and manipulated fury"" well...). I found the ending symbolic of a Western in ""Hell"" showdown. Yep, not only did director Richard Pearce have his cast and crew playing in lots of water, but they also did an impressive job of playing with fire. Keep in mind this was years before the movie Backdraft. Street location footage and the hiding in the swamps of Louisiana footage help NO MERCY remain a credible viewing entertainment.  Some of the hard-boiled dialogue by the police Captain (George Dzundza, for example -- who is good otherwise) is too easy to laugh at:  ""I don't like you I don't wanna' swap spit ...(really?  It comes from out of no where too..) but, basically it's ""go get'tum tiger"".  Legalities have become an afterthought.

The film features a great love-to-hate villain, Losado, played by Jeroen Krabb; a notable survival-in-the-swamp sequence wherein Gere & Basinger are handcuffed to eachother; and an action-packed showdown in an old city hotel.  Actually, I could do without the hotel showdown, as it comes off too cartooney and contrived (like when one of the villains barges right through a wall with his rifle -- Why sure!), but I suppose it can be accepted on the grounds of Western-like artistic license.  There's loads of foul language but I found it realistic for these types of individuals in such critical situations. So I didn't mind it too much but my wife took (minor) offense.  Gere's still relatively young here (36). I realize many hate him, but I'm a fan of quite a few of his pictures, e.g. ""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""King David"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Kim Basinger doesn't do much for me personally, although she's certainly pretty and her acting is effective here. I know it's a matter of taste but ""No Mercy"" provides zero 'babe appeal' for me.  The film was shot in Chicago and Louisiana (and some parts in NC).  The score is moving despite the dated mid-80s electronic drums.  FINAL WORD: It's hard to put into words why I like this film to the extent of writing a review. It's nothing exceptional, but it somehow 'works' and gets better with repeat viewings. I bought the dvd a year & a half ago and have watched it three times since, which is something I rarely (if ever) do. I think what attracts me is that it's more than just a mindless cop/action flick, although it has the thrills if that's all you're looking for. ""No Mercy"" has something to say about love, loyalty, courage, justice, freedom and happiness, but it's smart enough to not spell it all out. Hence, not only is the picture enjoyable to watch due to the 'movie  magic' but it can also leave you contemplating.  The film runs 106 minutes.

Gere and Kim Basinger go very well together, and the chemistry between them adds to the movie's realism. ""No Mercy"" in my view  is one of the better thrillers of the eighties.

It manages to mix humor with sadness in the best possible way. Aside from that, I think it has a perfect cast. Sally Field as the lead, the mother who worries about her diabetic daughter, Julia Roberts as her diabetic daughter, Dolly Parton as the lovable town beautician, Shirley MacLaine as the town grouch, Olympia Dukakis as the fun-loving ex-first lady of the town, and Daryl Hannah as the new girl in town. I can't get over how well I think this cast does together. They do perfectly together at making their friendship seem believable, and long-lasting.

There's a feeling of euphoria and freedom as we see beautiful landscapes and people waving to them. They pick up travelers along the way, visit a commune, swim in lakes, camp, and smoke pot. Ahhh, what a life of adventure.  However, events take a darker turn through intolerance. They just aren't welcome because they have long hair and are unshaven. Jack Nicholson, who plays an alcoholic civil rights lawyer, observes that it's fear and, maybe, jealousy of their free lifestyle. Nicholson gives a good performance and isn't the caricature that he later became. Eventually, the two bikers experience a bad acid trip and, finally, a senseless shooting.

I have a collection that numbers more than 5,000 in my collection going back to the silent film days, and I have served as a film reviewer in several publications, so I feel qualified to offer my insights about this wonderful ensemble film based on the Herbert Ross film production of the Robert Harling play.  One must first understand that Steel Magnolias was the first film director Herbert Ross did following the death of his first wife, Nora Kaye, in 1987. He said in an interview that Nora was an exceptionally strong woman just like the women in Harling's play and screenplay and he felt that he could pay her no better tribute than to make Steel Magnolias the best film of his long and illustrious career in her honor. When Ross passed away in 2001 we lost perhaps one of the greatest directors of his generation. Steel Magnolias was nominated for three Academy Awards (unfortunately, a split vote between Shirley MacLaine and Julia Roberts robbed both of them a Best Supporting Actress Award), two Golden Globes (of which Julia Roberts won one for Best Support Actress over Sally Fields), A Chicago Film Critic's Award nomination for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win), A People's Choice Award for Steel Magnolias as Best Dramatic Motion Picture (which it did win), and finally a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win). A handy tally of success to say the least. Steel Magnolias was the 5th from last movie Herbert Ross would direct before he passed away of heart failure.  If you're an ""Easter-egg hunter"" (quite literally in this instance), look for the playwright, Robert Harling himself, playing the part of  the minister at the Easter festivities (both at the beginning and end of the film), the ""Ouiser never did a religious thing in her life,"" joke in the church, and at the funeral. I won't go into too much detail with spoilers.  Many people love to rehash Steel Magnolias for the script, this actress or that actress, but the truth is that Steel Magnolias was one of those films that was just plain spontaneous combustion. It was the right screenplay, with the right director, one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled (that includes Tom Skerritt and Sam Shepard--who's a damned good playwright in his own right in addition to being a world class actor--put he and Dolly Parton together and it's pure magic!) and the enticing cinematography of the beautiful area surrounding the true backdrop of Robert Harling's original story, Natchitoches, Louisiana. About 6 years ago I was driving through the area and stopped to see if Natchitoches was as beautiful as it was in the movie and I can tell you it isn't. It's even more gorgeous than you see in the film! It's warm and caring community of people who were just as changed by Robert Harling's play and screenplay as some of you were! I strongly suggest you drop by, kick your feet up and stay awhile!  The one scene I will center on without too much spoiler alerts (turn your head! Turn your head!) is the funeral sequence. I've been known to write a story or two in my days and every time I see Steel Magnolias, the funeral sequence always impacts me emotionally, and I wish I could write half as well as this scene plays out.  Even though I know exactly what's going to happen (who am I fooling? I have the script memorized and mouth the words without making a sound!), I have NEVER had a movie, play or event in my life that takes me from one emotion and slams gears into the reverse direction so abruptly that you have NO choice but to react to both emotions you're feeling at the same time! In this case you can credit Sally Fields, Daryl Hannah (who does a sort of dorky blonde Jesus freak), and Olympia Dukakis grabbing the gear-shift on everyone's emotion by using Shirley MacLaine's grumpy Ouiser  character. If you've never seen it then I suggest you get your popcorn or snack ahead of time and take the phone off the hook. You really don't want anything to interrupt the dramatic rhythm of this sequence.  If you want to know what my biggest problem with this movie; it's the ending. Everything about my writing skills says it was a beautiful ending, but emotionally, I have this feeling deep inside my heart that I wish I could find out what happens to everyone.",One of my Top 20 Movies of All Time,1434240000,,,critic's slam roberts qualify i've entice event driving understand ever say dorky spoiler last strongly get many dolly thing direct making olympia steel direction impact write really picture warm hook joke part turn tell success original easter right serve magnolia nominate would heart sequence jesus everything ago funeral ahead cinematography finally field sound maclaine film community two support without happens stay credit go every actress wish combustion feeling know away phone grumpy much blonde like emotion woman could kaye character everyone mouth several screenplay generation problem instance everyone's nomination aficionado good deep long unfortunately gear-shift publication minister see suggest one death love daryl react stop silent memorize sam win gorgeous day pass first awhile time reverse rhythm globe felt illustrious see inside backdrop year drop plain shirley big robert scene case choice play gear failure story parton though take center popcorn ensemble use always three exactly natchitoches support film playwright snack magic head end emotionally career true reviewer spoiler script rob known half write area least spontaneous take ross must director play sally surround offer back award number vote beautiful foot good ouiser fool perhaps care split what's festivity truth interview insight bafta make begin i'm word best louisiana look freak life wonderful motion happen well say strong harling's hunter herbert cast maclaine's woman shepard--who's abruptly detail find quite grab rehash movie easter-egg handy pay world emotion kick addition feel exceptionally golden wife religious damn great hannah nora play tally honor chicago pure change director go lose dukakis together julia collection award want academy skill sort church production literally tom assemble even interrupt tribute skerritt never class say actor--put people's include alert end people harling base dramatic anything follow

All the actresses in this movie are very familiar to me and they play their part magnificantly. Us ladies should always band together in support each other like these ladies did instead of bitching about one another. I still cannot fathom Sally Field with a sourthern accent but she does make her role believable. There is a surprise ending although it is very sad in its own way. Olympia Dukakis is exceptional in that she tries to make others laugh in a sad situation. Either way, the plot indicates that us females can and will support each other in times of every tough crisis possible. The actual author who made the play that this movie is based on also has a sad story in that the play and this movie was based on his sister's illness and ultimate death. He does appear in this movie as the pastor in the beginning of the movie when Shelby is married to Jackson; and again serves as the pastor at the cemetery.

I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.  I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.  After the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself ""I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act"" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.  The movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.  Unless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.  This opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.  The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.  I couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.  Recommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films. There is no other reason to watch this other than to use this movie as an example of the saying, ""opinion's are like ........ everybody has one.""",Vastly overrated movie that doesn't stand the test of time,1462579200,3.0,,garner local internet think argument go poorly jack i've genre's downhill come stand understand ever say start slow heard nobody actually time favorite many thing sure make till possibly direction movie rave read actor really shrink despite part boring government bet would learn water drive-in young sound idea corman main either films life political go example every know give footage admit much nicholson think breath plot remind like positive ranting nowhere freedom lesson nothingness guess matter watch listen hold realize can't nothing several hippie generation today fiction well burn long ok see one whole direct afi's first help time belongs act spend alive bomb also talk decent suppose see discussion incredible edited protagonist exactly expectation afi local inconsisticies i'll additional use recognize genre true say average think independent job next ridiculously bad poor enough dennis eventually critic idiot act edit fan suppose movement like waste act good animal consider use hollywood watch commentary get particular sometimes liberal end opinion's ridiculous man make watch i'm along coming look typical life bunch know well say classify unless find way feature science appear movie mind opposite everybody pretentiousness roger action lucky shrink loser recommend great disappointed test somebody already terribly minute budget ignorant great that's include slowly exceptional reason live go sound lose hopper want lifetime biker movies....low lover even weed opinion smoking teach never review mention seem flat people

Produced during the decline of the studio system, Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper, was made on a small budget and is today regarded as a cinematic milestone, ushering in the New Hollywood movement.  Bikers Wyatt/Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), with money in their pockets from smuggling cocaine across the border, head from Los Angeles to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras. En route, they are temporarily sidetracked by a commune of free spirits and later arrested for parading without a permit. In jail, they meet drunken lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson), who agrees to join them on their road trip.  The movie is constructed episodically. One scene takes place at a roadside cafe where the trio is denied service. Another depicts a bad LSD trip in a cemetery, and yet another has the three guys smoking pot around a campfire and revealing more of their backgrounds. Though Wyatt and Billy are drug dealers hoping to live a life unanswerable to the establishment, they are portrayed as attractive characters bucking the system and  for a time  getting away with it.  Easy Rider didn't look or sound like any movie made in America up to that point. It was clearly groundbreaking for the film industry, but also had a dramatic effect on society in general, with baby boomers coming of age questioning the values, rules, and policies of the older generation. The movie is still powerful and still resonates as a commentary on a divided America and generational conflict.
