72,118737,4,True,"08 22, 2015",AI7ZX2Z7LIE55,B000AMBOIK,,Josh A Miller,"Totally old fashioned awesome trickle charger design in that it is not electronically controlled :) That can be ""GREAT"" or <Harmful> depending on what your need is or how it is used. As with manual transmissions, manual battery chargers are hard to find these days. Plugged it in and the transformer has a noticeable ac hum. Current draw 2 watts no load and about 20 when connected to battery. On my multimeter output showed 13.5v open circuit but when connected to a small 12v battery the voltage did SLOWLY CLIMB TO 16.2v (wow) which is why it needs to be monitored and NOT left connected indefinitely. For normal use 14.6v is the takeoff point when it should be removed. 14.4 to 14.6 is the correct voltage many automatic units peak at and let it drift down to a ~13.5 float/maintenance voltage. For an ""equalizing charge"" once every 3 months to keep the 6 cells, (2 volts nominal per cell) in sync, and to desulfate battery for longer life, let it go slightly over 15v for 30 to 60 minutes and remove (One thing an automatic charger won't let you do!) An occasional mild overcharge is desirable but for flooded batteries only, not for AGM or sealed batteries. Continuous overcharge is not good. A powerful charger can drive the voltage too high, too fast, depleting fluid level, eroding the positive plates and shortening life. Since lead-acid batteries generally take hours to absorb the final 20% of a healthy full charge, lower output is in your favor. For more LEAD-ACID BATTERY info visit ""batteryuniversity.com."" If your battery is an AGM, sealed and/or non-spillable type, do yourself a favor and get a charger that is automatic, since sooner or later you'll forget and leave it on too long which will damage those.   At 13v it showed 1.0 amp charge rate, 0.7 amp @ 14v, 0.5 amp @ 14.5v. With 2 screws removed and case opened there is a centrally located transformer and behind the 6/12v switch is a circuit board that includes the rectifier and automatic reset circuit breaker protection for the output.  PROS- can attempt to charge a totally dead (0 volts) battery (as a safety feature, most newer automated chargers need a voltage threshold met to verify polarity before they will activate, therefore if it is totally dead they refuse to activate). Can even be used as a crude 6 and 12 volt power supply. Same 50amp clamps as other Schumachers and price was great. ($16.40)  CONS- Fewer safety features, no indicator to let you know it's connected or charging, (unless you install your own). (Best to connect clamps before plug- first red to positive, black on negative, to prevent a spark that can potentially ignite hydrogen gas if present). Then plug in. Potential exists for overcharge if not monitored that can at best gas some electrolyte from battery or worse erode the plates over time. AGM type batteries a.k.a non-spillable sealed lead acid (SLA) are sensitive to overcharge and are easily damaged. Most powersport batteries are that type. A smaller battery (such as motorcycle size) is at greatest risk of being overcharged/ damaged by this thing if not monitored so if you want a SET-n-FORGET maintainer do not buy this, Buy an automatic for that purpose. (Battery Tender Jr $25and BatteryMinder 1510 $50 are 2 I'd recommend, there may be others but stay away from automatic Schumacher and Keyline products they have a flawed algorithm). Voltage is reduced via wire-wound transformer unlike the newer style switching adapters which means it is heavier, can only be used on 120v and is slightly less energy efficient though more reliable.

To start off I will say that I highly recommend sealing the lens of these, mainly on top and bottom. Mine had about 1/8"" void between the black casing and the lens. Not saying they would have leaked or gotten moisture in them but I would personally rather not take the chance. The packaging was a plain brown box and the lights themselves were in foam surrounds so I don't believe that under normal circumstances anything could happen to them. The lights themselves, other than that small void that I fixed with clear silicone, seemed very sturdy and the wiring was good quality also.  I installed one set on my wife's Chevy Tahoe and the other set on my 08 Civic coupe. The install on hers was extremely quick and easy because she had existing factory fog lights that were destroyed and all I had to do was splice these into the factory wiring and mount them. I did have to purchase a wiring kit to install these on my Civic but it was still fairly easy to do with a little bit of knowledge.  As far as performance I couldn't be happier. I was afraid that they would be too overpowering to oncoming traffic but they are not at all. They are very bright and add just the right amount of supplemental light to my factory headlights. In a pinch they are bright enough that I could drive with them alone. They light up signs and eyes of animals from a very long distance which pays for itself.  *One thing I would like to clarify is that with this mounting bracket it is possible to mount them with the mounting bolt BEHIND the light instead of just top/bottom. I put the bolts through the holes for the factory tag mount on the front of my civic and it worked perfectly.

112,166311,5,True,"11 17, 2014",ANX90VFGSI1W9,B000C2YAJI,,Tenshi X,"I drive a 2006 Jeep Wrangler with 4.0L engine.  I have reached 85,000 miles and had already replaced the serpentine belt.  I have read that it is also recommended I replace the idler pulley and automatic belt tensioner.  The Gates 38163 is almost completely identical to the original OEM Chrysler/Mopar part.  Here is my experience installing it.  Things you'll need:  * 1/2in drive breaker bar * 3/8in. drive ratchet wrench * 3/8in. drive Torx T40 bit * (optional) new small rubber grommet * (optional) thread locking compound  First, it is a good idea to take a picture of your serpentine belt and how it winds around your engine and pulleys..  There is supposed to be a belt routing diagram on your radiator, but often this label is often damaged.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  Depending on your tools, it may be easier to remove the fan shroud and clutch fan so they won't get in the way.  I won't cover this here.  Insert the square part of your breaker bar tool into the square hole in the middle of the tensioner arm.  You turn the breaker bar to tighten the arm spring and remove tension from the belt.  While holding your breaker bar, carefully remove the belt from one of the pulleys - then carefully relax the arm.  Remove your breaker bar.  The tensioner arm (and serpentine belt) is now ready for removal.  Attach a high quality Torx T40 bit to your ratchet and carefully remove the bolt securing your old tensioner arm to your engine.  Take care not to strip the head as you loosen the bolt!  You will reuse this bolt on your new belt tensioner.  Once you've released your old tensioner arm, do not remove the bolt from tensioner arm yet.  Carefully examine the threaded side on your bolt - there is supposed to be a small rubber grommet (or ""O-ring"") on the threaded side hugging the bolt.  Many guides online do not mention this rubber ring!  I am not entirely sure what the purpose of this rubber ring is, but I suspect it is used to dampen the vibration between the tensioner arm and engine and/or to help keep the bolt in place.  If this small rubber grommet is missing or damaged, you could use a small O-ring seal normally used in plumbing like kitchen and bathroom sinks.  An assorted size pack of O-rings is common and inexpensive.  If you still have the original rubber grommet in good condition, carefully separate the rubber grommet from the bolt.  Once separated, you may now remove the bolt from the tensioner arm.  After removal, while examining my original belt tensioner I was able to spin the pulley very freely with my hand - this means that the bearings no longer had sufficient grease to lubricate them.  With the brand new pulley, the pulley turns easily as I use my hand, but I could not spin it.  This means my new Gates belt tensioner's bearings are well greased for the job.  Reinstall bolt into your new Gates tensioner arm.  Lightly lubricate the small rubber ring and carefully slide as far as you can into threaded end of bolt.  If you want, you may now apply thread locking compound at this point (I didn't feel it was necessary).  Attach new Gates tensioner arm to your engine, hand tighten Torx bolt, then use ratchet to finish tightening it.  You do not need to use a lot of force to tighten it, just tighten to reasonable amount.  I found some sites with a torque specification but I found this to be much tighter than original, so I didn't trust this - I recommend to just tighten to reasonable amount you can do with your single arm alone with ratchet.  Don't put your weight on it!  You never want a broken bolt stuck in your engine!  Also careful not to strip the Torx head!  Once your new Gates tensioner arm is bolted back on, reinsert the breaker bar and wrap the serpentine belt back onto all the pulleys.  You remembered to take a picture, right?  Refer to your photo or belt routing diagram on your radiator.  One hint is that the grooved side of the belt will only ride on grooved pulleys and conversely the smooth side of the belt will only ride along smooth pulleys.  Release the arm, remove your breaker bar, examine everything - and you should be done.  In case you stripped your T40 bolt or need a new belt routing diagram sticker, below are the parts you can get from your dealer:  6507743AA - belt tensioner T40 bolt 53031700AB - belt routing diagram sticker for 4.0L  It's much easier than I made it sound.

For the most part this pipe is durable and well made. It just has one glaring weakness: the flex-pipe area. It WILL end up failing and leaking on you. However, based on my experience I think this would be true of any brand pipe for this vehicle in this price range.  I'm pleased because these feature quality fit and the price really can't be beat. I've simply resigned myself to the fact I need to spend $40-$60 and about 20 minutes or so under the car to swap these out every 18 to 24 months. It's still a fraction of the cost of paying to have someone deal with it for you.  INSTALLATION: Installation is typically pretty easy. Just be sure you order the two gaskets you need for the two flange areas so you're ready to go. If you forget to order them with the pipe your local auto parts store should have them.  As far as getting the pipe to fit, I've never really had a problem with things lining up right. That's always a plus when working with exhaust components. The biggest problem I've had is with the hanger. On one of these the hanger was mounted it an odd position.  You may need to tweak and bend the hanger a bit to line up properly but that's to be expected I suppose.  Removal and Installation Tip: Odds are you'll jack your vehicle up and inspect to make sure this pipe needs to be replaced before ordering. Once you've verified the part needs to come out, do yourself a favor and spray all the fasteners with some penetrating oil at that time. This way it will have a couple days to soak into the fasteners while you wait for the replacement part to arrive. These bolts can be pretty corroded and difficult to remove. If they look badly corroded once you get them out replace them. Use some new bolts and coat them with plenty of anti-seize lubricant. If you plan on keeping the vehicle odds are you'll be under here again in a year or so. Spend a few bucks and make things easier on yourself the next time.  WHAT ABOUT CORROSION? The two pipes I've installed feature solid construction and they actually resisted corrosion better than I was expecting. Like most economical exhaust components the first areas to start rusting (at least externally) were any area that had been welded. It's basically unavoidable in a non stainless steel exhaust.  The vehicle I've installed these on sees gravel roads, rain and plenty of snow and salt in the winter.  You CAN buy very high temperature spray paint intended for use on headers and exhausts for around $7-$10 a can which helps a little. I'm not sure whether the manufacturer would recommend it or if it would void any warranty etc. but I've done it in the past and it helps a little.. No matter how great the quality of any external coating, it can only help so much since exhaust rusts from the inside out too. Does it help enough to matter or enough to make it worth the added time and expense? Not on THIS section of the exhaust. It's a moot point here. I wouldn't spend too much time or money worrying about corrosion with this pipe.  The flex pipe area will fail LONG before you have to worry about rust through.  MAIN COMPLAINT: If you haven't figured it out by now, my main complaint with these pipes is the inherent weakness of the mesh flex pipe area. It WILL end up cracking, failing and leaking in the area. The most common spot seems to be the joints where the mesh area meets the rest of the pipe. It will develop a leak at either end.  In my experience it's not a matter of IF, only when. I've spent time making sure everything is perfectly aligned, I've verified motor mounts are good and there isn't any abnormal vibration. I get it. The flexpipe eventually wears out because it is designed to flex and sacrifice itself to allow a little flex as the motor moves. It takes the flex so the rest of the exhaust doesn't crack or break. I just wish there was a way to make these pipes last longer than a year or two.  Thrifty do it yourselfers are probably thinking what I was starting to think. Yes. You CAN buy just sections of decent quality replacement flexpipe and attempt to replace just the flex area. It certainly is possible but it isn't worth bothering with in my opinion. By the time you cut out the leaking section and clamp or weld in the replacement it just doesn't make much sense. IF you can get the parts a little cheaper than the replacement part (It's close) the additional time you'll have to invest isn't worth it. I can bolt up a replacement in 20-30 minutes. I'm not looking to turn that into 2 hours to save $10 and potentially have the same problem in a year. I may keep the bad pipe next time around and try replacing the flexpipe just to say I did it. That way I'd have a replacement ready to go.  I was going to rate this three stars instead of 4 but I'm not sure that's fair since the flexpipe is more an OEM design issue. The OEM pipe that came on the car from the factory went bad at the flex area. . . although it did last the better part of a decade. In my experience you'll be lucky if you get 18-24 months out of these replacements with normal driving. If you drive hard. . . plan on even less time.  DIAGNOSTIC NOTES: I install these on an 03 OZ Rally Ed. Lancer. When it develops a leak at the flexpipe area you often can't see it at first. If the leak is bad enough you can hear a change from the normal exhaust tone near the front to middle of the car. It has a distinctive note you quickly learn to recognize after your first leak. If you jack the car up with the engine off and everything cooled down. (Vehicle hasn't been driven for at least a few hours) you can then start the car on jack stands and listen and feel. Look first since some leaks can be seen. The original flexpipe area had failed enough I could see the leaking seam opened up. It isn't always that easy though. Feeling along the exhaust system with your hand close to seams or around joints and suspected trouble areas is usually a quick way too find a leak. As long as the car hasn't been driving prior you'll have a couple minutes where you can run your hand along the exhaust without worrying about getting burned. You'll typically feel ""air"" or exhaust gasses blowing out of the exhaust at the point of the leak before you see anything in a lot of cases with the flexpipe.  LEAK IN PIPE MAY CAUSE ERRATIC IDLE AND OTHER DRIVEABILITY ISSUES: Your car may idle and run poorly if you develop a leak anywhere in this particular section of exhaust on the Lancer. There's an Oxygen sensor in the exhaust manifold and catalytic convertor BEFORE this pipe. There's another oxygen sensor at the catalytic convertor section of the exhaust immediately AFTER this pipe downstream in the exhaust. If you get even a mild leak in this section of the pipe it can be enough to throw a ""SERVICE ENGINE SOON"" light and DTC error codes. I believe the last time it was a P0171 complaining that the system is too lean on bank one, but it could vary. This isn't the end of the world but in my experience the ECU attempts to compensate and correct what I assume it perceives as an incorrect air fuel mixture or ratio. That little brain means well but it usually results in an erratic idle and some other drive-ability issues.  With an exhaust leak in this area I've had the engine idle poorly with a hunting or surging idle that revs up and back down and the car has also had issues with rough acceleration etc. Fix the leak, clear the codes and it ran and idled just fine afterwards. The good news is you can temporarily plug the leak on a daily driver while you wait for the replacement pipe to arrive. Exhaust tape, soup cans, hose clamps. . . you do what you have to do to keep driving until you receive the correct parts. ;)","Good quality for the most part.

Period.  Any backyard mechanic can figure out this installation easily.  The mounting brackets are metal-stamped with the location of the bracket, as in DF for driver side front, PC for passenger side center, etc.  This helpful fact is not mentioned in the instructions.  For the Silverado the bars are different for either side as the center bracket is not centered.  The longer dimension between the center hole and end goes to the front.

Simply tuck the strap between the padding and shell, and friction will hold the ratchet in place (much like a book bag's friction buckle).

Here is my review of the last three kits I have installed as I posted on the Spal review.  I Installed the Deluxe Spal kit in hopes it would work better than the last two similar kits. First off, I'm a licensed contractor, fabricator and machinist. I am well versed in custom auto installations as well and have built a few ground up hot rods. I'm confident this kit was installed properly and all precautions were taken to give it the best possible chance for proper function.  The Spal deluxe kit was and is by far the best engineered and best performing of all I have tried but it too failed to lift my windows at even a remotely acceptable rate. The hardware was acceptable and the kit provided everything necessary for a standard installation. The Spal was the only kit that did Not come with switches. Spal is made in Spain and the fit and finish of the pully drive and motor housing is fantastic! It's very nice. Performance in a truck or van however, is not acceptable. Down is fast and smooth. Up is boggy and extremely annoying. By the time it reaches mid point it sounds like it is going to release smoke and fail all together. Keep in mind that with the hand crank the window moves freely and easily through its entire range.  My conclusion is that there are simply no cable drive power conversion kits that are going to work for my work van. If I could find an OE power regulator I would go that route.  The previous kits I have tried were the AutoLock which worked acceptable for the better half of a year before slowing to a useless speed. The Auto Lock had the best hardware package with heavier mounts and better quality isolation grommets and screws It also came with the nice flush mount, back lit switches. The AutoLock motor and pulley drive was made in China and cheaply assembled.  The next kit I tried was the XO Vision PW203. Total junk. They did not even make one rotation of the crank! Hardware was same as AutoLocks.  Lastly the Spal and it to is getting boxed back up for return.",Omg cheap.,1404086400,2.0,,give engineered second nice heavy power remotely chance switch hand drive spal performance work find extremely smooth like come sell fail lit however reviewer boggy custom simply could come properly half installation motor function hot china post slow next last useless contractor hop screws grommet mount take precaution cable vision cheaply stop good range license lastly finish lock rate conclusion one boxed entire package annoy quality lift back xo junk perform make window conversion possible point similar far installation reach go sound speed crank pulley confident work together fit autolock amazon first van housing route pully time mind fail would fantastic fabricator auto standard everything mid also assemble proper even truck necessary regulator ground easily fast release smoke rotation provide move make built oe window mount i'm best two total try previous return kit instal kit rod well machinist acceptable freely hardware go deluxe three year get autolocks isolation flush keep versed pleads review spain

I have a 2002 Liberty and followed Justin on the install.  I have no gas tank cover either, and my holes must have been more rusted than Justin's, cause it was a pain to install it.  I had to start the holes with a M11 X 1.5, and then switch to the M12 X 1.75 tap.  Spray with WD40, Tap a little bit, take it out, and then use a rag to clean the tap and inside the hole as well (using a small tap with the rag around it) and repeat the process.  Took me about 1.5 hours to tap the first, the rest went quicker until I was down to about 20 mins to tap the 5th hole.  Wasted several rags and the tap began cracking.  My suggestion is to be careful not to wail too hard on the tap, because breaking it off would be a serious headache. Leave it to Chrysler for the design flaw on the exhaust.  Even with someone pulling on the muffler there's no way I can tap the hole, therefore, no way to get the bolt in.  Had to install it with only 5 bolts.  If I ever replace the muffler I'll tap the last hole.  But removing the muffler requires cutting it, so it isn't an option. Also, a hitch extender ""might"" be necessary.  The hitch doesn't come out far, and the spare tire is right there above it.  If you have a drop down hitch, that'll obviously help.

I thought perhaps the nozzle had gotten a bit of plastidip clogged in it and it wasn't coming out as well despite the fact I had sprayed the can upside down after the first use.  I tried a new can and it still bubbled.  I was kind of disappointed at this point because it had looked so good after the first coat.

I bought an amber/amber model, and the brightness was much less than the amber/white model I had.  The amber/white light had LEDs that look like CREE LEDs.  The amber/amber model has round LED bulbs, which are much dimmer than the others.  Very disappointing.  I'm returning the amber model, and ordered another amber/white model.  Hopefully they send me another good one.  January 4, 2015 For the price, this is an excellent light!  I have 15% tinted windows, and this light can be seen thru the tint in the daytime, and near blinding at night.  WIthout window tint, this should be blinding by looking directly at it anytime, day or night.  I made the mistake of buying a $13 LED light that looked similar here on Amazon, and it was a joke.  I could have lit a match, and it would have been brighter than that 8 LED light.  This 16 LED light is amazing.  The $13-$20 lights use cheap LEDs firing directly thru the lens, with a diffuser lens.  This light has the LEDs fastened to a circuit board on the bottom of the light, aimed straight up, with mirrors in the back to turn the light 90 degrees directly thru the clear lens.  You can see the LEDs are better quality in this light.  They are large square LEDs, like CREE LEDs, or the LEDs you find in high dollar flashlights.  These are not little cheap LEDs like you find in cheap-o flashlights.  For $35, this light is tremendous.  I'd highly recommend this light.  I bought it based on other reviewers before me, and their positive reviews held true for me.  I received an amber/white model.  The only problem I had was the fasteners to attach the bracket to the light were not in the package, so I'm sending it back for another one based on that.  If it had instructions included with a description of the screw thread, I would have gone to the hardware store and bought some.  Since there were no instructions, I said heck with it, and I'm sending back for a new unit just to get the screws.  Others have said they had Federal Signal Viper markings on their lights.  My light had a Tocas sticker on it only.  No other markings on it like others have said.  Even if it's generic, it's the best $35 I've spent.  If it happens to fail ever, I'll come back and update.  I will definitely buy more of these.

So I got another of these, and it's worth noting that they have added an extra bit of material on the front to help you tuck it under the tire.  *Update the second* This newer version with the extra material and reinforced handles in the front really did make a big difference - I have not had the same problem with the cover slipping up the front tire at all. This one has now made it through one New England winter after we moved last fall, and I expect it to make it through a second, but maybe not a third - it's developed a small hole in the silvered/heat-protected part where it touches the exhaust, in itself pretty minor but likely a preview of things to come.

This could be handy when confirming the output values of a replaced component.  I then tried to diagnose the MIL in my 2001 BMW. This did not go so well. I selected my vehicle and it would not connect. Finally I entered the VIN manually, it identified the same car (E38), and then began to work somewhat.

The stand is substantial, made in the usa, and comes card-packed with a top mount plate, two bolts (use the one that fits your set-up) and the little rubber foot.  The stand (theoretically) mounts underneath the bike. On the Serene, (pardon my ""bike part"" term naievity) there's a short bar that is parallel to the ground and lies behind the pedals, in between the chain stays (which i just learned is the bar that goes from the pedals/center thingie to the rear wheel axle). Problem is, the hole that's pre-drilled on the Serene that the kickstand's bolt goes through, is too small for the installation of this kickstand. Drilling it or enlarging it was not an option I wanted to explore.  Here's the good news: I called Greenfield (number on the pkg) and a very nice woman answered the phone. She put me on the phone with a nice gentleman who listened and then explained my options. He sent me some extra parts after patiently and carefully explaining how to install. The parts arrived, but unfortunately, it still wouldn't fit. That's the bad news. I even tried smaller bolts from home, but the chain stays sit lower than the kickstand crossbar thingie and the mounting hole in the kickstand was larger than the bolt, so the kickstand wouldn't quite fit or be sturdy.  I am so imprssesed by the excellent customer service provided by this company. I imagine a grandmother and grandfather in a workshop on mainstreet USA, handmaking each kickstand to order. Putting love into each one, as if it's being made for their own grandchild. I doubt that's anywhere close to reality, but that's the feeling I get, and that's rare these days.  In conclusion, this is a good-looking and well-made kickstand, and the company has excellent customer service. I am planning on buying the rear-mounted version from the same company.

I purchased the 50 inch 5D series curved light bar for $129. Just like you see in all videos regarding Auxbeam bars, the box had been through hell but the bar itself was somehow unscathed. At first glance the bar looks great (for a $129 light bar).  Some things that irked me right off the bat is the lack of connectors on the light side of the wiring. The harness came with protected female spades but the light itself only had stripped and tinned wires. No biggie. A couple of male spades and everything fit together. If you look real close at one of the pictures they have a couple lose connectors laying there. Those were not in the package. The reason it bothers me is because it's sort of implied in the listing that it's plug and play.  Before I even turned it on I noticed that the alignment of the reflectors in relation to one another is a little off. The lenses themselves are also not crystal clear. The beam pattern is kinda wonky. The included picture is from 10ft away with the bar perfectly level.  The thing is bright but not what I would have expected from a 50"" 288w 28880lm light bar. (I know the numbers are BS but I really was expecting more).  After only having it on for a minute or two I noticed the wiring from the relay to the light was very warm to the touch. When turned on from room temp within a minute you can feel it warming up. For a 288w light at 12v pulling 24amps you would need atleast 12ga (.081) wire. I was surprised (kinda) to find 14ga (.064). All the other stuff I could have put up with for as little as I spent, but the wiring really has me worried. Gave it 3 stars because I went bought it hoping for the best, expecting the worst.

A made in USA product at a competitive price, that is a win win product!  This year it don't work.  I pulled it out and did some ohm meter tests on it.  The thermostat is fine but the heating element is not.  Zero contuctivity through the heating element.  Now I have a gap in my radiator hose that I have to fill so I have ordered another one.

It is reasonably priced and it should work for a long time.  There isn't much to it.  Perhaps the bend radius of the heating element is a little sharper than it can tolorate?

The item is just as described and appears just like the pictures.  It is great to have if when you keep it in the trunk.  The cover was easy to put up after reading the instructions that are included.  As the pictures indicate the cover protects the top portion of the car, so if you are looking for a cover that will cover the entire car, this is not it.  It is for fast and easy covering.  In addition this also has the functionality to use on the go.  While your car is parked in the sunny lot all day at work or a day trip to the beach or other area to protect it from the sun or other elements.  The car was kept cool and I appreciate not only the ease but also that it is protecting my car paint job.  This is used for a lexus sedan and the size M was an ample fit.  There is a bag that holds the cover and the pole for storage all in the same shiny material.  The material is lightweight and I believe its some sort of fiberglass.  It feels like a tarp material in the silver easily wipeable, with elastic edges.  To restore just fold up and reattach with the attached strap and buckle.

1203,550764,5,True,"02 13, 2011",AQ8QDBFUEHUQB,B001IZKDTE,,Pete W.,"Very nice cover.  It comes with it's own storage bag that cinches with draw strings and it includes patching material should it be needed.  The cover itself is very durable and well made.  The material is very soft so as to not scratch the finish on the camper. There are several vent flaps along the sides to ensure adequate ventilation beneath the cover to prevent condensation, which can lead to staining mold growth. The cover is prominently marked with front and rear printed on it letting you know both the direction and which side goes up. Putting it on is very intuitive.  It has four adjustable slightly stretchy straps attached along the top edge of the two long sides.  There is a protected (to prevent scratching) bendable metal strip (approximately 2""x 5 or 6"") attached to each strap that make securely attaching the straps to the camper frame a snap.  The slight stretchiness in the strap provides just the right amount of tension to keep them in place. I only had to adjust the fit during the original install.  In both January and February when I came up to camp I just popped the straps loose from the frame tossed the sides up on the roof of my Pop Up and pulled the cover off from the front, rolling up as I went. When I back up I did just the reverse and re-secured the straps without having to readjust them at all.  Trust me when it's cold that's a blessing.  I've found putting this cover on initially took maybe 30 minutes.  Now removing takes less than ten minutes and putting it back on maybe 15 minutes, and that's because I double check everything. I put this cover on mid November at the beginning of winter and I've returned and used my camper twice since then in January and February.  The cover is staying put and holding up well.  My camper is located on a heavily wooded lot in northern Virginia and there's been above normal snow fall this year.  I have not seen any adverse affects to the top thus far.  I will update this review if I have a differing experience, but so far I am very pleased.  I do have another cover on another Pop Up camper.  I bought this cover from a different manufacturer two years ago.

This will display graphs of individual sensor signals chosen from the live data menu, but if you want a pattern for an injector, or a crank/cam sensor, you'll have to use an oscilloscope on that circuit. Resolution is too coarse for subtler glitches and transients but most problems are pretty obvious and this will do just fine on those. Graphing response time is okay and an equally quick numeric display is at upper right, but the live data menu sampling rate is 3+ seconds. This is way too slow to give a sense of what's happening when you blip the throttle to check out  that annoying hesitation. It's much slower than the 3130, which is just under 1 second. Watching multiple live data values as they change immediately and rapidly can tell you where to look next, particularly when there's a problem but no code. So maybe in those cases I'll use the 3130 first, then switch over. Clunky but doable. This is still a decent value at under $200 and fills some gaps for me - it's handy for seeing certain sensor patterns without printing out a wiring diagram and physically accessing the test points with a scope - but if all 31603s and 31703s are slow in the same way, it would be a drag to have one as your only scan tool.

I use this on all our off road toys and have put it on everywhere there isn't heat or a handle. It brings everything back to life with a nice deep look. You can spray it on and walk away, which will leave a higher gloss and take longer to dry or you can spray and buff, which will also look great but with less gloss. I've used this on faded seats, wiped off after 10-20 mins and it completely restored the colors without making it slippery.  Couple of tips: Use it like you would spay paint, one or two light coats. Heavy coats can work but start to run and buildup, which can take longer to dry and risk dust and dirt sticking to it. And make sure your items that you're spraying are completely dry, water just makes it run.  And if you're curious, I've found that this works extremely well on our autos too! If you lay something over your tires to protect them, you can spray the inside of your wheel well and you'll get a two'fer. 1) dirt, mud, yuck will have a harder time sticking, if at all, and make cleaning a breeze. 2) Any black plastic under there will most likely be faded, but not after you apply this.

It comes with instructions on how to install the part, but not how to get the original part out. If you have never done any kind of DIY repairs I would not start with this one, but any experienced DIY will be able to do this. Here are two things that I learned from installing this part. First, the instructions are written as if you are replacing the driver's side regulator so instructions on how to get the regulator installed tell you to put the top of the left side window lift in first etc., but if you are doing the passenger side it would be the right side. No big deal, but I was thinking the instructions were for the side i was replacing. The biggest heads up is the 2001 Grand Caravan with the climate duct work in the door will need to be modified to get the door panel back on. They have good instructions but you will need a heat gun to heat up the plastic duct and press it in a bit so there is more clearance and the door panel will snap back into place, The instructions say to heat it up and then go really fast and hook the door light, the electric lock and the door handle actuator rod into the panel and then snap it in while it is still pliable. That is a bit unrealistic so I heated mine up and used a potholder to put pressure on the hot duct and pushed a section down about 3/16 of an inch. This was not a real big deal since I own a heat gun, but if you didn't have a heat gun (and Dorman touts how they are a direct fit) it could be an unpleasant surprise. The instructions seemed to indicate that adjustment was only necessary on some models of 2001 Grand Caravans.","Great product, but read this is you have a 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan.",1472947200,,,think plastic heat door diy work potholder modify pliable section could need caravan hot tout get actuator experienced climate press inch big gun direct indicate real mine surprise oem leave handle seem put thing write really replace lock one hook part model tell quality lift back original deal place right panel improvement electric caravan snap kind able installing good instruction use passenger fit first come bit light would heat learned top etc pressure still unrealistic rod necessary regulator start adjustment fast install clearance big side dorman head repair never push window grand since two driver's instal go unpleasant say do duct

It is a slightly different design and construction of the OEM filter (87139-48020). Instead of being light, thin, and flat, the MANN filter it is heavy and provides as much more physical area of the filtering materials by way of the increased number of pleats. Compared to the other filters I have tried, this filter is much more robust and provides much better odor control. Simply by inspecting them side by side, you can see that this filter is much better than the original style.  I value clean air so I try to buy the best filters! Every bit of help counts, hence I require activated carbon filters.  I have attached pictures of what an OEM style filter looks like against a MANN filter. When you hold the filters up to the light, the ATP, TYC, and OEM appear paper thin and light can be seen in abundance. Whereas the MANN filter, hardly any light shines through.  Will I buy again? No!

Usually, by the time work is over and I can get on the mower, there is not a lot of daylight left...especially late summer when the grass is still growing well.  I had the idea of adding some really bright lights so that I could keep on trucking until the grass was all cut  I tested them yesterday and wow, they are very, very bright.  In my garage, with the sunshine shining in, these were bright.  They were bright on top of sunlight hitting the wall!  So then last night, I tested them again...and thought wow again.  These will light up the neighborhood!  The housings appear to be very well built, nicely anodized and with fairly serious heat sinks built in.  The silicon-jacketed pigtail cables are plenty long enough to attach to my wiring harness (I will cover it all with wiring loom for durability).

We could barely see the display due to reflections on the screen.  We still had our older nuvi 1450 in the car so we put them next to each other.  After checking the brightness setting on both, the 1450 definitely has a brighter display than the 2597.  In fact, by dimming the 1450, we determined that the 2597 display brightness was about 60% of the 1450.  The display background on the 1450 is bright white, where the 2597 has gone to an off-white or light grey with streets highlighted in white.  That seems to add to the display issue.  In most cases, the difference is probably not a problem.  But the 2597 display will have a hard time overcoming sunlight on the screen or reflected light on the screen from inside the vehicle on a bright day.  We had one of those cheap visors from Amazon that helps with direct sunlight.  I still have an ongoing complaint about these units and that's the way it announces and displays upcoming turns.  It may say to turn on 1st Street which in fact may be true in the local jurisdiction you're driving, but in fact is also US41.  1st Street may or may not be identified by a street sign, but US41 definitely will be.

The measurements are clearly listed, so I don't have too much sympathy for those who just didn't bother checking. The front/windshield shade was far too small for my car, but I knew that going in.  It's the same size as 90% of other shades of this style, so I gave it away, and it is working perfectly in a mid-size car.  The rear shade is a perfect fit, while the other four are only about 3/4ths the size of the side windows they go in.  I get the most use out of the front left/right shades...  With a nicely fitting sunshade blocking the windshield, and dark tinting on the rear windows, it's only the front side windows someone could look through. These cover about 3/4ths of the window, and easily slide into the weather stripping around it, though not secure against wind. That makes it very easy for me to setup and take down, but actually very difficult for anyone to get a good look at what's inside my car (seat-backs block part of the opening) like bags of gifts and a stereo a thief might like to steal.  The other shades I only want for some extra privacy in the rare event that I need to park my car in somewhere long-term (e.g. airport lots), or possibly being unable to find any motel vacancy (big events or bad weather) and needing to sleep in my vehicle.  I've seen people sleeping in their vehicles without shades, and it's a difficult, sad and embarrassing sight. Even if these don't entirely cover all your windows, it's a vast improvement over having nothing, with all the privacy of a fishbowl! These things fold down into a super-compact size, so they don't get in the way, and will be in some little pocket of your car when you unexpectedly need them. Bulkier shades would periodically get removed to make space.  For just $11, it's a great buy.  But you can find the same set a couple dollars cheaper:  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IDEAPRO-Full-Car-6Pcs-Folding-Silvering-Reflective-Car-Window-Sun-Shade-Visor-Shield-Cover-Keep-Away-Sunray-Uv/dp/B00SGUCP68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IDEAPRO Full Car 6Pcs Folding Silvering Reflective Car Window Sun Shade Visor Shield Cover Keep Away Sunray Uv</a>  I do wish i could find a set with 20% longer side shades (and taller front shade), but until then, I'm much happier having these, than none at all, and the price is good.","A bit small, but great for my purposes",1451088000,2.0,,"sad away steal clearly much use find i've none longer needing dollar unexpectedly way event nicely strip like extra shield event space rear could four someone need e.g visor actually might perfect shade sleep privacy lot get vast nothing dark bulky anyone open mid-size take big great possibly seat-backs tint sympathy size silver little somewhere see thing stereo rare entirely love part park setup windows improvement front/windshield far motel yes go good vehicle fishbowl periodically perfectly reflective couple fit super-compact cheap price want full list suv measurement windshield thief block would what's happy left/right uv</a buy bad folding sun embarrass vehicle sunshade even data-hook=""product-link-linked inside easy easily front airport class=""a-link-normal taller secure check difficult fold bag side make long-term bother unable window car style sight around i'm pocket set work block without shade look though cover wind weather sunray make sleep slide people know go fitting gift vacancy remove absolutely keep small wish give"

If I were a little younger and not handicapped, it probably would have been a breeze.  I like the little lift they gave to my van with 25 psi in them, but after driving for approximately ten miles on some local pot hole roads, I decided to drop the pressure to ten for every day driving.  After I drop them to 10 psi the van was as if I had never installed them.  I did use the T for installation, because to I wanted a balanced ride.  I installed the bags with the line through the top of the coil springs,  because I didn't like the lines hanging from the bottom. I was concerned of the air line being damaged due the possibility of hitting an object in the road. I ran the air line through a 1/4 inch wire protective wrap just for extra protection for the air line.  I attached the cross over line to the break line which is over the rear axle with the provide zip ties.  I installed the air valve in the jack storage area where a mounting hole is already provided. In the bottom of the jack storage is a rubber grommet and I drilled a hole just big enough to force the air line through and sealed it with glue. I am handicapped with my right foot which makes me unable to walk any distance.  I purchased these for when my wife and I go somewhere that I will be required to walk, I can take my scooter and not have to worry about a sag in the rear of the van, the bottoming out and drag of the hitch.

I used a Purolator P1267 filter which came with a cork gasket. I also ordered a second ACDelco pan magnet to help pick up any debris in the fluid.  Now any future ATF changes should be much easier and less messy! If you have a 2WD 4L60E vehicle this pan will give you an extra quart or two of capacity as it is deeper.,"Built in drain bolt, nice painted finish.",1404950400,,,give second aft pan capacity much deep pry way strip tahoe come order extra need take torx shift fluid pick less cork thing messy magnet exhaust change future transmission hold able easy consider vehicle debris perfectly use fit bracket help also filter atf remove drop forward process purolator nuts/bolts two old gasket risk acdelco quart bolt

These are simply awesome.  I am attaching a picture of the carpet from the driver seat and the rear of my 2013 after 3.5 years of having these floor mats.  That carpet was spotless.  In the rear picture you will see the OEM floor mat.  That was after I took out my weather techs, as I was not trading those in.  My new truck came with rubber floor mats from Ram, but they do not protect like the weather techs do.  So, I got some birthday money and ordered these.  You cannot go wrong with them.

R.,"Over the years I've had a number of different kinds of these devices and think there should be one in the trunk of everybody's car. I've been driving around without one lately. I had loaned my previous one to a co-worker to use and he some how managed to drive over the nozzle and broke it. So I was happy to get to try out one of these compact units. The day before I was to receive the compressor I ran over something on my way to work and ended up having to take my car into the tire place I use. I had apparently run over some sort of screwdriver and it pierced the tire. Still, it was a slow leak and I was able to get to the shop before the tire went flat. But all the way there I was worried I wouldn't make it and would have to pull over on the side of a busy road and deal with changing out the tire for the spare. If I had this compressor I wouldn't have worried as much.  Today (weeks later) I came out to get in my car to go to work and found I had a flat (that same tire that had been fixed). Figured it would be a good chance to test the compressor. This has to be the smallest tire compressor I've ever used. I have to say it worked adequately. Taking it out of the box and unwinding the power cord was pretty intuitive. The power cord is long enough to reach both the front & back tire locations - as long as you use the car doors on the side with the tire needing air. I was surprised to find that this unit doesn't use the typical bayonet style connector, but instead has a screw on connector. I screwed on the hose connector finger tight. Turning on the compressor is done with the single button on the front of the device. The compressor makes a bit if noise as the air pump runs and vibrates - which is typical of air compressors. I like that there is a pressure gauge built-in to the face of the unit, made it easy to know when to turn off the compressor. The gauge is marked with shading to show the typical rAnge of air pressure for most passenger cars - but, that shading is red, so I might wonder that some people might think that was indicating Danger. This compressor lived up to the claim on the box that it could fully inflate a tire in about five minutes. That's about all the time it took me from start to finish before I was on the road heading to the tire shop to get my tire looked at. I am happy to have this compressor in my car, it's one less thing to worry about.",Something every car should have,1498780800,,,surprise know indicate finger power fix air leak manage much chance apparently week i've use drive shop work find needing button way like drive come red adequately ever built-in slow could compact take head might receive loaned try location think car unit tight get claim pierce co-worker enough screw small gauge unwinding thing take something today run wonder test trunk different device later minute connector unit lately go intuitive happy cord long find box range look less finish inflate that's one face danger back turn pump deal make place nozzle everybody's pull able good single take use work ended passenger bit number turn fully time sort would tire lived broke bayonet compressor compressor worry pressure kind still spare figured start hose easy front five day year road make side screwdriver reach vibrates car door style around worry run instead without previous typical run device screw make noise flat people go shade say busy do show change pretty mark

Also there were no mounting bolts included, after contacting Amazon via the live chat I was able to get a Smittybilt site via email to inquire on how to get the mounting bolts. A regular nut will not work and I was surprised that no one else complained about it unless the bolts were included in the winch they bought. I cannot make a review on how the winch functions as I cannot even mount it to use it at this time, until someone tells me where I can get those mounting bolts. Update: Did not hear from Smittybilt yet. What I ended up doing is using 7/16 bolts and nuts. I had to grind down four nuts a little so it would fit in the slot on the bottom of the winch. I don't know if the casting on mine was off which caused the 7/16 nut not to fit, took a while but I got it mounted onto the steel plate. Now I'm waiting for some 2 x 4 box iron to mount the plate onto my trailer.  The instructions included are very vague, they have a separate sheet on how to put the wires onto the winch, which is not needed as the wires are labeled abc and where they mount onto is also labeled with letters. They do not tell you a thing about how the winch should be mounted or what parts should be in the box. There are instructions on how to mount the controller, but they are not very clear, but you should be able to figure that out for yourself.

I love the zip out windows and the fact that they are tinted. The dark windows give more privacy to the cargo area which is very nice.  I feel like the material is a little heavier-duty than the Bestop material.  The stitching looks a little heavier-duty than the Bestop.  This top does not flap as much as the Bestop did, and so is quieter.  The fit is not as good as with the Bestop, and I have wrinkles in the top itself, and the windows, where the Bestop had none. This is after more than a week of having it installed, so it has had plenty of time to ""iron itself out.""  Where the top bow lined up with the cloth diagonal area that split the side windows, on the Bestop, the top bow does not line up and so is, under the window material, rather than the cloth portion, with the Rampage top.  The optical clarity of the windows is not as good as with the Bestop. This is not related to the tinting, but to imperfections in the window material itself. The material has tiny bumps in it. It is worse on the back window than the side windows. I was always very impressed by the optical clarity of the Bestop windows, which could be photographed through. These are more like what I expected plastic windows to be like, before I experienced the Bestop windows.  I love the idea of the velcro over the zippers, but the velcro does not stick very well and the fit is not good in some places as well, so there are places where the velcro won't stay stuck even when sitting still.

I emailed and they sent me a replacement.  I installed it and things seemed ok.  I never used it though.  A few months later I tried to use it but it got hot and smoked without pumping any fuel. Just what you want around gas, right! So I quickly turned it off and disassembled it AGAIN.  The switch they sent me had melted. I determined that the pump would not turn because one of the pump vanes was stuck, so the motor was shorting out.  I cleaned and lubricated the vanes and replaced the switch (at my own expense), so for now at least, its working again.  Really poor construction overall.

2110,154925,1,False,"08 22, 2015",A3QZF27CDUPCLX,B000BYGGVC,,Paul Sheer,"Each manufacturer recommends specific spark plugs in the Factory Service Manual.  The RECOMMENDED spark plug is the one you should use. Using a different spark plug, or a different plug gab, puts the ignition system's electrical characteristics out of balance. Some of the symptoms are:  1. Failure to start due to overheated coil. 2. Engine cutting out in certain temperature ranges. 3. Coil failure. 4. Engine missing. 5. Misfiring at certain throttle patterns. 6. Pre-detonation.  There are many fancy and gimmicky spark plugs on the market. They all perform better than stock plugs, but they require specific tuning of the coil and plug wires using a high-voltage OSCILLOSCOPE to be sure the spark current discharge pattern is what it's SUPPOSED to be -- typically only racing mechanics would go to this effort.  ""Upgrading"" the spark plugs alone is a VERY bad idea. You have to engineer the whole system -- this means using expensive wires, plugs, and a coil all designed to work together.

Their puller set is one to avoid, especially since this quality set is only a few dollars more. It is imported, but from Taiwan, not China. The major problem with the cheap set (that I returned) was the cone to spread or tighten the two and three jaw pullers was not even close to symmetrical.

Since the wires have different guages and colors from the stock wiring, it is very difficult to get lucky enough to get them to work correctly.  I even was persistant enough to finally find the wiring chart for both the universal sensor (Delphi) and the Ford stock colors.  I matched them up and they still did not work right.  Once I bought these Bosch units, I plugged them in and sent the car down to get smogged.  Even with 267,xxx miles on the engine, it passed with flying colors!

The interface is reasonably intuitive, size of the unit is unobtrusive, battery life is excellent, and the voice prompts let you know what you're up to when you're mashing the buttons.  Phone pairing was easy, but updating the firmware was a little fiddly.  My particular unit had problems with the Bluetooth connection to my phone.  Unless the phone was in line of sight to the unit, the sound would cut out badly, and simply turning my head would cause it to be interrupted.  This was a single bad unit and a replacement corrected the problem.  Rather than exchanging at Amazon, I RMA'd the unit to Sena.  It took them about two weeks to turn the unit around to me, which seems excessive.  However, the RMA was for the main unit only, and I received a full brand new unit in return, so I now have a spare battery, headphones, hookups, etc.  Based on that I am completely happy even though there was a bit of a wait.  My replacement unit works great, and will play music all day long and into the next day before recharging.  It also paired easily with a friend's Sena (different model) and voice communication is fine after a little bit of practice with the controls.

While the probe extenders are nearly too long to fit in my Fluke meter case (but they *do* fit), they help keep me out of harm's way, so I don't mind at all. The extenders provide me with a safe option to getting too close to live circuits.  The probes are just like the normal Fluke probes, but the insulation extends nearly to the end of the metal probe tip. Only the last 1/8th inch or so of the probe tip is exposed. This helps prevent arc flash if a probe tip should happen to slip off of a hot terminal while getting readings. I've seen what happens when a normal (long exposed tip) probe slips off of a hot 480V terminal screw and shorts to a grounded cabinet: the blinding flash and deafening bang can easily cause you to fall off of a ladder or work platform, jump away from the panel and into other equipment (or into the path of a forklift) and/or suffer burns. And you'll need to buy some more probes once you quit shaking...  This set includes a set of normal Fluke leads as well, so you'll have a spare set to use when your existing leads get worn out or damaged.  Everything is typical Fluke quality, so the set should last for a very long time.

Pleased to learn that these 8"" lights that mount on 2"" centers are pretty standardized. LEDs seemed like the way to go. Install was fairly straightforward. I used red heat shrink connectors from Harbor Freight and a very nice Ancor Insulted Crimp Tool that I bought right here which cost more than the lights! Install was pretty straightforward, but I recently repainted my trailer and couldn't make good ground. The lights didn't work. I had to take it all apart, file and wire brush off some paint (and rust) and get down to shiny metal. Then I bolted the ground O-ring terminals outside, right on the steel. Once I verified that everything was working, I repainted the bolts and the surrounding steel. O-rings on the outside don't look as cool, but they allow for better access if ground needs to be established again. I launch my PWC in the ocean, so I can't mess around with corrosion. I replaced the 1/4"" carriage bolts and nuts with stainless and added lock washers. The only downside is a common ailment for all plastic lights: the channels that are intended to grasp the heads of the carriage bolts will distort under pressure and allow the bolts to spin.

The box they come in is fine for compact storage if you have them for emergency use.  But if you use them regularly like I do, just get a larger storage tub for them.  Make sure they're very tight or they might come off.  The only thing worse than driving on a steep slope without cables is driving on a steep slope thinking that you have cables.  You can buy other sizes of tighteners to get the right fit or even double them up.  SZ1174 is the size that comes with this one.

The reviews were all over the place from did not fit to did not line up and had to enlarge or drill holes, several even said that they could not use all 18 bolts provided. . . we call those spare parts for other applications at my house.  I have to disagree with those that said the product did not line up with the holes in the body of Jeep. I will say they didn't quite line up exactly, but loosely attaching them all and THEN tightening them once all successfully in the holes accompishes what you need. I used 6 bolts on each side, 3 in the pinch weld and 3 in the threaded holes on the underside of the body. The steps are extremely secure and this matches what I have done with other steps in the past. There were some that said the pinch weld bolts were difficult to install because they could not use a ratchet.  I used a combination wrench to hold the bolt and was able to use a 3/8"" drive ratchet and 10mm socket to tighten the nut. The bolts that screwed into the threaded holes were easily installed with a 13mm socket and ratchet.

I was not satisfied with the previous products I had tried as they did not improve the weathered appearance of the rubber trim and did not last very long. The Einszett product made a noticeable improvement as soon as it was applied and allowed to dry. My first application was two months ago and the rubber trim looks as good today as it did the day I applied the product.

I always read on ebay and such that OEM is so great. But in this case OEM is not great becuase you cant see the antifreeze in the tank becuase its yellowed so bad and has dirt in it. This tank comes with the level sensor and the little drain hose for the overflow. Its well made and i looked at the hose connections and they have the metal sleeve in them just like the OEM tank does. Its alot easier to see the antifreeze level and for  someone that isn't used to checking that it makes it much much easier. I see on Ebay they have the diehard selling the used tanks that they boost are OEM and they don't look any easier to see through then the one I took off. This tank is a perfect fit and after i installed the hoses and everything i was very happy with the diameter of them and how they matched up with the hoses. I had expected that maybe the diameter might be off a bit but thats not true. This is a well made tank and Dorman evan has put a tag on them with a 800 number to call if you have any questions.  It was much cheaper then buying at the local parts store and arrived promptly. I was kicking myself saying that i should have changed the old one out much sooner...it really makes a difference..iT does come with the radiator cap also.,FITS PERFECTLY AND COMES WITH CAP AND SENSOR.

I have this tire on my DR650 and a smaller size of the same K760 on my wifes 125 as well. This tire works AWESOME off road in dirt and even real soft sand.  as for my wifes bike, we used to have to basically carry/drag it up a sand covered hill before installing these tires. Now, both bikes can easily power their own way through soft sand and mud.  The lug spacing is just far enough apart so that they do not clog with wet material.  The side lugs allow both of us to travel along a slope with out the tire washing out to the low side.  The street performance is kind of a compromise however. they have no where near the traction of a full time street tire, especially in the rain. but they do good enough to get you to and from the trails and some regular commuting. A bike with these installed shouldnt really be used to carve corners on the tarmac like a sport bike but I also don't think anyone expects these tires to do that. They do exactly as they were intended, and they do a great job at it. ""horses for courses""  Ive got maybe 300 miles on them so far and it looks like they might wear a lot faster than my other tires but these are sooooo much better off road that i think its worth it.

There was corrosion all over the back of the thing, on the circuit board and all over the connections. I could see moisture on the inside of the walls.
