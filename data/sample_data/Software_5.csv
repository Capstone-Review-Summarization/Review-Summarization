It has a variety of templates that allow you to set up ways to monitor and track expenses. It has features like how to create purchase orders, track inventory, and run payroll, etc. As a small business owner (very small, employees = 1), I didn't really need all the extra features, but the ones that I did use were pretty intuitive. It does, however, allow me to bill clients an invoice using Microsoft Outlook, and with a nice, professional looking template to boot. It provides easy integration with Excel, allowing me to transfer business reports between the two seamlessly. As a whole, I wish I'd gone with the Express, which is the free version, because supposedly it's got less junk that I don't need to bog down my time, but for the features, I'd recommend Accounting 2008 to a small business owner.",Easy to use and intuitive,1211328000,,

I use Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) on my MacBook Pro as does our executive producer while the other three use Windows and, unfortunately with the updates from 7-X making it incompatible with Windows, they have to use other software for editing.  We were thinking of acquiring a few licenses for Adobe Premier as some of us had used it before, but were very fortunate to be able to try Corel VideoStudio Pro X7 and Ultimate Edition (see ultimate edition for related review).

Our co-producer and primary screenwriter tested Corel Pro and, after a month of use he has produced several video prototypes that look almost as good as FCPX albeit with some missing features that are in the Ultimate Edition.

Our screenwriter (Barnard) noted that the editing interface was incredibly comprehensive with your standard storyboard tools and clip editor very similar to FCPX.  He loves the selection of transitions, text editor, features generator (blank screens, shapes, etc.), and much more but laments that it lacks the smooth streamlined feeling of Final Cut.  Perhaps it was his older computer (Windows Vista, yick!) but he did notice a few moments of technical delays and lacking smoothness of operation.  Oh well.

Next came the email issue--which took hours more to set it up.  It essentially took an entire day to install and set up, occupying the computer and rendering it useless for any other tasks.

My husband is STILL complaining about the damage wreaked on the laptop by this security software. For experienced users, this was way over the top in terms of its invasive nature and slowing of the computer.  It undoubtedly prevents any kind of invasion from the outside world, largely because it nearly severed the connection with the internet because of how it slowed the system down.

It cataloged and re-organized his email too--deeming most of it as ""spam"", regardless of what his original sorting of it really was. It marked every single ""safe"" sender in Outlook as spam, and completely erased all of his gazillion rules managing the email. It also stopped future downloads of email into Outlook until the software was removed from the computer.  It also eliminated all RSS feeds.

It completely prevented working on websites--it regarded everything as ""malicious"" or ""suspicious.""  (For the record, this was a laptop with a dual core processor running Windows 7 Ultimate x64.)

All in all, it lasted a week.  It was a disaster, and two weeks later, he still rants about the havoc.  It was not easy to remove either, leaving traces of itself in many locations, resulting in a lot of ""clean up"" work being required, in addition to the time fixing Outlook.

On the plus side, for inexperienced users who don't work on websites or manage mega-email, it's easy to use and seems to do the job it is intended to without disrupting their surfing, email, and other typical tasks.  It has to be set on moderate or minimum security level in order to work.

We've used McAfee, Norton, Trend, NOD32, AVG,and BitDefender in the past, in addition to Microsoft's Security Essentials.  We have never had any security suite wreak this much havoc or be this much of a problem, on ours or anyone else's computers.

""The RosettaStone Version 4: French Level 1,2 & 3"" is a fun, engaging introduction to learning a new language.

The program comes with three corresponding Audio Companion CDs PER LEVEL, for a total of 12 disks of instructional software in one product. (The Audio Companion software can be downloaded to an MP3 player). Each Level has four different units, for each of which you practice Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Phrases, Speaking, and more. RosettaStones' unique feature is its use of ""language immersion"" as a teaching tool. The program shows you images and the corresponding French words for what is in the pictures. There is no direct English-to-French vocabulary translation (that I've seen thus far), and this makes learning the language more enjoyable and more natural. The graphics are very aesthetically pleasing as well.

The audio software is one of the best parts about this program. The product comes with a USB Headset Microphone, and the program uses voice recognition software for you to practice pronunciation. Better yet, you can record yourself saying the same phrase several times and then play it back to listen to your progress and compare your pronunciation to that of a native speaker.

One drawback to the program is that you cannot pause a lesson easily if you need to see something again. You have to wait until the end of the lesson and then go back to particular part of it, but this is a minor inconvenience that does not take away too much from the program's quality.

I've only begun to use RosettaStone, but I am very pleased with the product thus far and will continue to use it.""",Fun and natural way to learn foreign language,1219536000,,

I really like the idea of being able to open a PDF, edit it in WordPerfect, then resave as a PDF or convert it into other formats. (I'll admit that I've been trying to edit a PDF file for the purpose of this review, but I haven't been successful in opening one up for editing yet. I'm going to keep trying though & get help from the 'Learn More' button on the PDF Import pop-up)
I also like the new PDF Form feature for creating fillable PDF forms.

I also tried digital video softwares from Pinnacle, Roxio, Adobe Premiere. However, Corel software beats them for stability and easy of use. The Adobe Premiere is a great software, but it's overwhelming and overkill for most of us. In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other softwares.

From product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn. The basic functions are easy to use and intuitive. You use the timeline to place video clips, then add transitions, background music, titles. After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.

Once a while, bad batch did occur (like Microsoft's Vista), the VideoStudio X3 was slow and crashed a lot. The VideoStuido X4 has significantly improvements. It integrates the disk authoring tool. So I don't need to run separate tool to burn DVD or Blu-ray disk. Also, VideoStudio X4 is extremely stable....I haven't run into any crash after several home video projects.

However, editing HD videos requires a very very powerful CPU, this is especially true if you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you feel frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to mouse clicking, video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.

Here is one trick I learned from Video Magazine. While running the VideoStudio with you main hard drive (like C-drive), you should put all video files (both the video input files and video output files) in a separate hard drive. Doing so can ensure a better system performance. With my system, if I put all the video files in the C-drive where the main program resides, from time to time, the VideoStudio program will still hang (not response to your mouse) for couple of second (not crash). This hanging problem goes away once I put all videos files at a separate hard drive.

So far, I have done 4 home videos and created 4 AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X4.

It will open another browser to connect to your bank, store or just about anything else you might want to go to even if you are just going to browse merchandise or seeking information.  You have some choices here; to always use it or decide whether to use or never to use, none of which seem to be universally observed by KIS.  It slowed down entry into the sites to the point of timing out on all of our laptops.  Especially aggravating was the connection to 2 of our banks which use of a Secure ID card to generate a pass code number in addition to log-on ID and passwords.

KIS also slowed down all 3 of our computers especially the Lenovo A8 8 Gb laptop.  Sites requiring data entry were especially vulnerable to this slow down.  Entering information into Gas Buddy was particularly painfully slow.

Warnings about bad or outdated certificates were a common occurrence - even sometimes on the main Google search page

643,5,False,"04 21, 2015",A31N0XY2UTB25C,B0001FS9NE,,Stephanie Sullivan,"The Netgear ProSAFE 8-port Gigabit Click Switch is a office-space networking game changer. The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This ""smart-switch"" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.

Design:
One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.

The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.

The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.

The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.

The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no ""power brick"" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.

The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.

Configuration:
I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.

' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.
' Change the password - The default password is ""password"", so change it to something better!

The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.

The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:
' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)
' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)
' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).
' Port by port Rate limiting
' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a ""disable"" setting to turn a port off if desired)
' Port by port Broadcast Filtering
' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)
' Multicast control via IGMP snooping
' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)

Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.

Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.

Green Power Use:
The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or ""dumb"" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.

Support:
I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.

Conclusions:
The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.

The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many ""dumb"" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.

I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.

I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.

Also, I would say NOT to buy this for college students without checking in with them first. There are many Universities who offer completely free access to this software if students want it, so they may have no use for a separate license.

Those things said, this is actually a fairly decent offering, particularly if you buy the key card version that can be discounted.

The PC is currently running Windows 7 x64.

Installation of the software was easy.  The user interface seems to have been refined over the years, and it is very straightforward and intuitive.  Instead of replacing the Windows firewall, the 2012 version enhances the Windows firewall configuration.  They call it the ""Windows Firewall Booster.""

The AV component of this SW suite seems fairly robust.  They added a ""Fake AV Cleaner"" protection which targets malware that poses as antivirus software (shamefully, I have fallen victim to that in the past).  Scan times are about typical for a modern AV product, and a full scan always takes longer that you might expect.  My only complaint with this is the power saving scheme kicked in and put my PC top sleep during a full scan, so upon resuming the scan was sort of ""frozen"" and I had to restart it.

I don't use parental controls, so I can't comment on that aspect of the software.  I am happy with the fact that TM doesn't constantly pop annoying alerts and warnings - for the most part it runs silently until there is a danger requiring user intervention to solve.  I also don't use the backup feature - I have my own backup scheme.

I did try the System Tuner feature, and it basically does the same thing that something like CCleaner would do.  Actually, I prefer CCleaner.  I also run Spybot (another product) periodically and it finds things that TM does not.

Like the previous one, the software firewall and NAV do a good job most of the time.  I say most because, once in a while (esp. with the firewall), it fails to exhibit the right behavior.
For example, the firewall has a nasty habit of forgetting the rules you already set up for a specific application.  This version is much improved in this regard than the 2001 version, but it sometimes still asks you to set up access rules for an application -- as common as IE! -- repeatedly.  I don't know what's got into its ""head.""  I discovered that, for one, Norton can't distinguish between the DOS-style filename and Windows-style long filename, so it thinks it's two separate applications.  But there are also other cases where the behavior simply cannot be explained.
In addition to the firewall and anti-virus utilities, NIS 2002 comes with parent control (I didn't install this) and ad-blocking.  Ad-blocking is a joke.  It worked the first day I installed it, and stopped working after that.
These little things exemplify the problem with many Norton products of late.

The software is easy to install and interesting to set up and get immersed into.

A word to the wise though. Some people may approach this process very casually and try to either blast through it or not take it very serious. I can only say that any user, regardless of their background, needs to take it slow and pace themselves.

1. Approaching learning Chinese with this program should be like taking any college course.
2. You should take notes and keep a journal of your progress.
3. After the first three days you should start to chart your progress.
4. You should practice with the system at least an hour a day for the first five days.
5. You should speak aloud as many of the phrases as you can after every period once you've stepped away from your computer.

You don't have to be a native speaker to stay on course and progress, but please don't think that you'll be disappearing into the crowd or ordering deftly from the menus of out-of-the-way dim sum restaurants any time soon.

I recommend this program for people who have a serious yen, no pun intended, to get a jump start on taking Chinese. Some folks like to think that taking a foreign language is about memorization and  repetition. But that just isn't the case, if it was, we'd probably all be home schooled via VCR.

Listen to me, nothing can compare to learning Chinese in a classroom, under pressure and under the gun of requirements and deadlines. The benefit and the beauty is participating with other classmates and going over the material in a setting that can also build your confidence. Learning at home alone, with a set of headphones doesn't really give you this, even though you may walk away with some sound basics. If you're going to study this over the summer and then concentrate on a double semester course in Chinese, you'll probably excel and be the star student. In this scenario, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're going to lock yourself in a dark room and try to learn Chinese with this, don't get your hopes up.

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.

Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

I also show some tricks I've learned over the last couple of weeks of using the program, for example use Tab key to make all palettes disappear so you have the full screen to draw on, how to use any brush for an auto painting and not just the one's Painter wants you to see!

I show things none of the the other video's I've seen so far show so I think it's worth a watch ;)

Haven't had this much fun with a software program for a long time so check out the video to see just a fraction of the stuff I've come up with using this program for the last couple of weeks. I had always heard of this program but never actually tried it till now and don't know why I waited so long since there is so much you can do if you let your creativity take control!

The main idea you need to understand to get the most out of this software is what clone color is and how it's related to the clone brushes. Basically, if you have clone color from source image turned on whatever brush you use to paint on the canvas will pick up the colors underneath. Depending on the brush you use you'll see a totally different result. You can use the soft cloner brush to brink back more detail from the underlying photo if you don't like what you see. This can all be automated via the auto-painting wizard but only let's you do it for a couple of brushes. If you want to use any other brushes like the particle brushes, as I show in my video, you need to do it manually and my video shows how. Of course you don't have to start with a picture and start from scratch and I show a picture at the end of my video showing the results of some clouds and sun I painted from scratch but didn't have time in video to show.

I also used the trial version of full version of Painter 2015 and what I found is that you can do almost everything the full version can but you'll never have the power of the full version because the most powerful feature of the full version is not only that you get way more brushes to start with but you can create and save your own brushes! Also, you can import brushes and work spaces with color palettes that other artists using the program use. But even essentials comes with over 100 brushes so it will keep you busy for quite a while if you end up enjoying it as much as I have.

Oh yeah at the end of my video I show the before and after pictures of some of the images I created using this program.
Also, I put a screenshot of the brushes and interface of the older Painter Essentials 4 which I think was actually better since they actually used drawings of all the different brushes instead of just a scribble of what the output of the brush is going to be. Also, the help was way better in version 4 and it even includes some video's that showed how to use all different parts of the program which was also included in the 130 page manual it came with. It also came with some sample images which you could play around with and I used one in my video. The new version comes with a 25 page manual which isn't very helpful at all and basically tells you to search YouTube which is the worst advice since there's hundreds of Painter video's which a person new to the program won't know where to start!

Now, in the year 2001, there's plenty of girl software out there, but I'm not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  I've outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that there's anything wrong with those games; it's just that they're very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase ""For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up.""  That's me! (A bit over 10, but who's counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  It's an adventure game; ""Choose Your Own Adventure""-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion that's someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  There's a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of who's responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; there's really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and I'm sad.  So -- I think I'll order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.  I've always loved the books; and fans of the books might even laugh at how closely the game resembles the books in some instances.  Just like the Nancy Drew books changed the world of adventure books for girls; this game is a true icon of the progress in Girls' Games that's come along in the last decade.  Nancy is smart, intuitive, and strong -- and best of all, she doesn't wear a pink dress!",Keep 'em coming!,978566400,,

With a GPS puck (not included), MS MapPoint becomes a great GPS for salesmen, delivery men, and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner.  Most GPS devices fail in this regard (they work great from point A to B, and could include a detour, but forget about going to ten locations).  It would be great if MS had a self-contained GPS device (not a laptop) which could be programed with the information generated from MapPoint (by using a PC as the user interface, it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen).

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 version were resolved in this X4 version.  It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 A very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace.  You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software.  This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices.  If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.

The PaintShop Pro X4 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down.  With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10.  PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.  The rich set of tools included in PaintShop Pro range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the new ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.  This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects.  Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.  To help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.  One thing that I noticed was that the dialog box window for the 'Effect Browser' has not been updated to match the stylish new user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PaintShop Pro versions.

 The new HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools.  HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure.  There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing.  For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing.  On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating.  Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix.  In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at.  If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results.  But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots.  Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene.  This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output.  I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people.  HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at.  Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described.  So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo.  This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well.  As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.  When I mentioned above that Photomatix lets me specifically define and select the original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for people's faces, I can simulate this function in PaintShop Pro by using this new ""Photo Blend"" tool on the saved file output after using the ""Exposure Merge"" tool, but this workflow is very cumbersome and tedious.

 The new ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas.  This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 Although adding a vignette effect was present in previous PaintShop Pro versions, this has now been expanded into a separate tool with more flexible options.

 A new ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo.  These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 More than 20 tools have been upgraded to support 16-bit images.

 There is built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"".  The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos.  This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files.  Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos.  The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools.  Edits can also be applied to batches of files.  This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab.  Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work.  By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab.  I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools.  If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab.  The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top.  Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools.  And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'.  The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab.  One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool.  But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'.  Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are.  At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option.  Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials.  As with some of their other recent software releases, Corel has the help documentation in this PaintShop Pro X4 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched.  I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site.  After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access.  On September 2011, Corel released a 125-MB 'Corel_PSPX4_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on my computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new tab to display Corel's online help content.  And there does not seem to be a way to configure PaintShop Pro X4 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available.  But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed.  The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If, like me, your PaintShop pro install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files.  This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability.  During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook.  Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer.  When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This new X4 version of PaintShop Pro now requires only 1GB of disk space.  The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized.  So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required.  By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 10, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program!

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of.  If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free.  And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance.  In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.  But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go.  Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative.  If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4.  And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a previous version of PaintShop Pro, is this PaintShop Pro X4 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely!  As previously mentioned, if version X4's one main new feature was the addition of HDR tools, I would say to just keep your existing X3 version and purchase Photomatix for your HDR needs since Photomatix is far better at HDR processing than what Corel, or Adobe, has as their HDR offering.  But there are at least 75 new and enhanced features with version X4, and if you can purchase it aggressively discounted on Amazon, this is a must-buy upgrade.  Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 runs a lot faster and more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PaintShop Pro X4 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>?

I feel that PaintShop Pro X4 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 10.  PSPX4 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE10.  APE10 includes more built-in layer styles that PSPX4 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this.  Once you become proficient in PSPX4, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse.  Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PaintShop Pro, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem.  APE10 has more adjustment brushes than PSPX4 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation.  But PSPX4 has more artistic tools than APE10, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSPX4 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE10.  PSPX4 requires less than half the disk space to install than APE10, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE10, even though PSPX4 is far more packed with features.  But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE10 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSPX4.

One final note:

Two of the extras that are included in this ""Ultimate"" bundle are couple codes that allow you to download 21 photos from Fotolia and receive a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  However, these coupon codes have expiration dates on them, and on the package that I received, the offers are only valid through December 31 2012.  I do not know if this expiration date applies to the coupon codes of all ""Ultimate"" packages that are shipped throughout 2012 or if Corel adjusts the expiration dates for packages that are shipped out later, but that is something to consider if you are deciding to purchase this near the end of 2012.

Also, during the past 8 months, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for this PaintShop Pro X4.  After installing PaintShop Pro on your computer, you can either download these large 235-MB executables from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.","Excellent, affordably-priced ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"", with more features than Photoshop Elements 10",1342915200,3,

She loves drawing and sharing her drawings. When I saw that Anime Studio Pro 8 had the ability to take sketches made on paper and turn them into easy-to-manipulate animations, I knew that would be a great Christmas gift.

I am a complete new to computer animation. I was worrying that it might be difficult or very time consuming in getting started. Fortunately, SmithMicro provides a great getting-started tutorial that quickly introduced me to most of its main features. After about an hour with the tutorial, I am able to scan in and animate one of my daughter's sketches.

Thanks to the tutorial's section on using a ""bone layer"" to manipulate a sketch. It only take me about 15 minutes from (1) scanning a drawing, (2) adding some bones, (3) manipulating those bones along a timeline, and (4) finally exporting the animation to a Quicktime file (other export options are also available). I showed my daughter, and now she wants to learn to do some of this on her own!

I've only scratched the surface of what this software can do. SmithMicro's website has many tutorials available (some are online videos). I will dig deeper into the software's features when I have the chance. But for now, just being able to turn my daughter's cartoon sketches into actual animations is enough to keep her busy.

The software is extremely easy to use, and all that's required is for you to answer a series of simple questions for each category.

With that said, the customer support needs improvement. After e-filing my return, the IRS sent me a letter stating that they needed additional information on one of the forms that I had filled out. Being unable to get through to the IRS, I opted to speak with someone at TurboTax. While I was connected within 30 minutes, the person at the other end of the call was clueless about my situation.

While it was hardly art, it worked. With time, practice and exploration of the 313 page user guided (downloadable .pdf) and Corel's online guides,  I anticipate improving results as I become more familiar with this  program.

This software worked excellently from installation through export of my compiled content in its project manger to multiple output formats.

Installation on a Windows 7 machine (64-bit with 16 GB of RAM and a quad-core 3.4 GHZ Intel processor) took about 25 minutes. The VSP X9 installer included a progress bar that accurately indicated the install status.

The interface is based on a 3-part concept: capture (or import), edit and share (or output). In between are more options than all but the most proficient users will be able to appreciate. Output options are abundant, for both writing to physical media, creating many different digital file formats (of varying resolution) and sharing directly to multiple popular social media sites (including YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr and Facebook).

PROS:
-Works with many source file types (I didn't have any on my machine it couldn't work with)
-Outputs to physical media, multiple digital file types (at multiple resolutions) and social networking sites (YouTube,  Facebook, Flickr and Vimeo)
-Includes a selection of audio files to populate soundtracks with the ""Auto Music"" feature
-Includes an computer screen capture utility: awesome (since the most widely used of these can cost hundreds of dollars)

CONS:
-Interface is cluttered and not especially intuitive.
-No included help files., ""F1"" takes you to Corel's website. OK only if you have persistent online access (and vendors should NOT assume this); user guide and quick start guide are .pdf files that you have to download separately.
-Many of the effects and features (for both content and titling) could quickly tire viewers if over-applied. This is less a criticism of the software than of the potential for over-use of these tools by some users. This is especially true for the ""FastFlick"" quick video creator utility, which I felt did not do enough to let me know what effects were going to  be present as part of the pre-authored templates.

Finally: VSU X9 also includes tools for DVD authoring and 3D video creation; neither of these are part of my own regular user needs, so I didn't test them.

Having worked an IT help-desk at a large entity for years, plus having several IT Security duties assigned, I have personally dealt with several different AV and anti-malware products from several companies.
If you visit those ""AV Review websites"",  that create lists such as the ""Top 10 AV products of 201x"" you probably see that there is not much change in the rankings from  year to year.

I normally (personally) feel safe using an AV and Internet Security  product that was in the top 5, for use on my personal  home computers, tablets and smart phones.

So I chose Mcafee this time around.  I have used it a couple years ago and this time I had gotten an ""Unlimited Device"" license for the Mcafee Internet Security suite""  Previously I used Webroot on my laptop and smart phone (I think Webroot licenses Norton's/Symantec's AV Engine and uses that inside their product). I think both Symantec and Mcafee products do a decent job.

Moving along, the product review of Mcafee Internet Security:

Pro's:
- inexpensive [ bought during a sale]
- Unlimited devices can be covered with this product
- scan time about the same as other AV products out there
- works on Computers, Tablets and smart phones

CON's :
- when an internet ""potential bad website"" was detected and logged into the mcafee security program, the so -called FIX [when you click on the FIX IT button] is to send ME to the mcafee website to BUY ANOTHER ADDITIONAL MCAFEE PRODUCT!?
Mcafee LIVESAFE, I think it was called.

Note: This ""alert"" popped up when a friend visited and used my PC to log into their bank account. They FAT-FINGERED the web address and put in [...] instead of [...]. It seems the ""abankofamerica website is a phishing site!?

Comments:
I was a bit upset.  Why? Since for the past 10 years or so, whenever I bought an ""Internet Security Suite Software Program"" like this, it INCLUDED ""everything"" to clean up or FIX a problem. In the past, the ""Internet Security Suite"" programs had ""everything"" you would ever need. An AV engine, malware engine, Firewall and clean up assistance.
 It appears that Mcafee now Piece-meals out my so-called ""FIX"", buy trying to get me to BUY an additional product.

Hence the 3 star review.

My .02 cents worth of AV trivia and potential cost savings follows, having  researched several AV engines and AV software products:
If you go back 10 or 15 years, many AV companies created their own AV engines and took care of their own AV Updates for those engines.

When I worked the help desk and an IT Security incident with a virus or malware occurred, it was necessary to scan that computer with several ""Different"" AV engines/programs, to ensure to the best of my ability, that the hard drive inside it was clean (after the virus/malware was removed).
.
That is when I found out some AV scanner product companies actually ""created"" their own AV engine, while other AV companies simply ""Licensed"" someone elses AV company's Engine.

Fast forward to today and economics being what they are, many AV companies tend to simply ""license"" a well known ""AV engine"" and use it in their product.  Often times you don't know if company ABC is using an AV Engine they themselves created, or if their AV engine was simply licensed from company XYZ, then had company ABC's logo slapped on it.

Point being that  it is not like if you were to buy 10 different AV scanning software products, you'd actually have ten totally different AV engines to scan a computer with. Most likely that out of 10 different AV software vendors, maybe you'd end up using 3 - 5 different AV engines. (I haven't researched this in a few years so I don't have an exact number as to how many AV vendors ""create"" their own AV Scan Engine Vs. how many simply ""License"" an existing AV Engine from a different AV vendor).  Since AV vendors  ""can"" simply ""license"" the use of a well known AV engine, then slap it into their product, sometimes this is more expedient for them.

If you research  AV products, you might find that a less expensive company's AV product actually uses the AV engine of one of the top 5 AV software vendors. Sometimes this can help your wallet AND your piece of mind.  Example:  company ABC is a top 5 AV vendor and their AV product costs $50 a year for 3 PC's. Company XYZ ""licenses"" the AV Engine from company ABC to use in their own AV software, but they offer an ""unlimited Device"" license for just $25 a year that covers PC's, tablets and smart phones.",Piece mealing out features now !?,1477353600,,

I've used an earlier version of this software for just over a year, so when I saw this package being offered I ordered it for my husband's new PC which is running Windows 7.  I like not having all the advertising pop-ups that I've had to deal with on other anti-virus programs and I also like that it doesn't seem to affect the speed of my computer when booting like some other titles have done in the past.  I also like the fact that it installs very easily, just a few clicks of the mouse and you're on your way.  What is under the hood may be complex, but from where I sit it's very easy to use and I've never had any problems with a virus.

This product comes with technical support although I've never had any reason to use it.  It's pretty simple and straightforward.  Another thing I like is it scans your downloads of music, files, and applications and does it in the background without slowing you down and it's behind the scenes where you don't even realize it's happening.  You also get free upgrades automatically and scans automatically on a schedule that you can decide.  You can also do a scan whenever you want by simply opening the AVG control center.  There's a thing called LinkScanner SurfShield which ensures every website you visit is safe and you get a message if there's a question so you can avoid the site or override the software and take your chances.

All in all, it's a great security program.  Fast, easy to use, doesn't bother you with a bunch of ads for add-on products and you are hardly aware that it's there working for you.  Best of all, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware that doesn't get in your way,1260316800,,

It would have been nice if they had added some new title, transition or video effects, but they are the same ones that have been there since x4 I believe.

The price is favorable to Cyberlink however, about $15-$20 cheaper.

The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.

In some cases I am very fortunate, as some lines of my genealogy records so far go back almost 1,000 years.  In other cases because one side of my family recently emigrated (or more accurately, most are still in Iran), I have very little reliable information going back even 50 years.  So I can have both the puzzle and the satisfaction of a ton of information, and I need a lot of good research tools as well as a great way to organize my work.

I've used Ancestry.com before, without additional software, and the difference between the website and Family Tree Maker's GUI is substantial.  It's much faster and easier to work with this software.  I found the included documentation easy to use.  Importing pictures and documents was also easy, which was awesome as I have two very extensive word documents from two relatives that are now preserved for my family to enjoy.  I ran through a bit of the tutorial and found it well made, but the software was intuitive enough that I really didn't need it.  Exporting appears to be very straightforward as well.

For that matter, I put a lot of time into this software and have already exhausted my free month.  In that time I did not encounter any glitches.  Solid software.

Another point about Ancestry.com is that I don't really need a persistent subscription.  I'll get on this kick once in a while, usually just after the holidays, and then I'll go a year or more without having time for it.  This software gives me the best of both worlds as I retain my work and can even update my digital family tree, as well as share it with family when they visit, but I only have to pay for Ancestry.com on months where I'm going to be using it.  All my work is stored locally on my computer.

The different editions primarily pertain to the duration of the included membership.  I have the Essentials edition, which is the one I'd recommend as the best practical value, even though the Platinum costs less per month of Ancestry.com use.  And Ancetry.com is the real deal and will be of tremendous use to most people who are researching their family history.

The family tree viewing is dynamic and intelligently conveys relationship information in a variety of ways, especially for very detailed family trees in the Pedigree mode.  For me this had the effect of making it much more fun to include a lot more information and more relatives on my tree (and actually all of them).  The other effect is that people actually enjoy seeing my family tree, because it is actually easily presented on screen.

All I can say is that I found the software disappointing and needlessly complex. I held off writing the review to test it out and go through the tutorial, but wow... I mean they expect youngsters who love Anime to do all this just to animate a character?

First, the install. It went on my pc great. I'm running a Win 7 laptop 64 Bit. The install was smooth. The software nags you to register which I did. After install, it takes you to a main screen with a generic superhero character. From there on- the program devolves into a needless level of complexity.

I think its pretty incomprehensible that the developers decided to use Adobe Illustrator style toolset to create cartoon characters. The Bezier curve looks great when you are making realistic quality of art work for post print production but if you want to animate and draw a giant eye? Kind of overkill. Plus it is difficult and annoying to draw using points.  I think just the toolset alone will deter youngsters from wanting to use this program.

Second the tutorial. I downloaded it, and spent quite a bit of time with it. For such a large amount of work- the results of this program are amateurish and silly. I had to flip pages back and forth, to locate toolbars mentioned in the tutorial.  It is also pretty shamelessly brief. The end result? Something that looks like a child drew it.

Like the poser product, the software ships with some pre made characters. The creators want you to buy additional characters at cost from the online store.

I think if you are a graphic designer with a lot of experience, you might find this software useful, although I'm not sure for what- the end result looks kind of silly. All but the most harcorde nerd teens and youngsters will find this software to hard  to use.

The Windows 10 ""Start"" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.

I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking ""all apps,"" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the ""all apps"" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove items which made the list, but not add back the missing stuff (except by a torturous series of edits using ""regedit,"" which Microsoft has hidden to discourage use of this very dangerous utility).

Microsoft is obsessed with the ""tiles"" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the ""all apps"" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the ""all apps"" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.). Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.

Still, only one of my programs available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered. Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.

I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others). If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.

UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the ""programs"" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).

UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who ""upgraded"" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.

UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called ""Threshold Update""which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a ""service Pack,"" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.

UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called ""anniversary update"" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). For the past 11 months I installed and utilized ""Classic Shell,"" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay have rendered the Classic Shell incompatible. Thus, those who preferred the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are stuck with the latest abomination.

The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by the user  (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded programs). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless does not allow to be selected as the default security program.  And the ""no firewall"" doomsday message continues to appear.

Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed grudgingly to learn to live with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC), to somehow find my way through the cluttered and sometimes vague Settings menu, to locate and adjust to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).",Pretty -- As in Pretty Awful if You Prefer Using the Start Menu,1439251200,12,

12031,5,False,"04 27, 2016",A24HWYHR28JJ7A,B01CS8RSIS,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},AmazonCustomer,"Two years ago, I upgraded to PowerDVD 14 Ultra. Because PowerDVD 14 Ultra did not support FLAC audio, I still often used the VLC media player to play content that has FLAC audio. And to play ISO images on disk, I use Daemon Tools to mount ISO files to virtual drives that both PowerDVD 14 and VLC could then play. The free VLC media player also starts up a lot quicker than PowerDVD if I just wanted to quickly view something. Support for FLAC audio and the ability to play ISO images were both added to PowerDVD 15, along with a PowerDVD Remote app that lets you use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a remote control. PowerDVD 16 Ultra's two main improvements to PowerDVD 15 Ultra are: (1) a new ""TV Mode"", which I do not find that much more useful than the usual ""PC Mode"", and (2) some YouTube features such as the ability to download YouTube videos to play offline and the ability to upscale YouTube videos to HD quality, and the ability to watch Vimeo videos.

I was initially excited about the new YouTube features that were introduced in this version 16.  However, the new YouTube options are VERY buggy :-( In trying to play various YouTube videos in PowerDVD 16 Ultra, the software would either tell me that the video cannot be played and it just provided a link for me to play the video using the Web browser, or the PowerDVD busy-icon would continue to spin forever until I clicked the [Stop] button to end the attempt at playing the YouTube video and I had to use the Web browser to view that video on the YouTube site.  But for the online videos that PowerDVD is able to play, I am then able to use its TrueTheater audio and video enhancement options.  I often turn off the TrueTheater function when playing Blu-ray discs.  But YouTube videos often have mediocre video or audio quality, and so I find the TrueTheater enhancements to be very useful for playing online videos.

With many YouTube videos, PowerDVD only offers a subset of resolution qualities.  For example, I often encountered YouTube videos where PowerDVD only gave me the option to play it at two or three resolutions, such as 360P or 720P quality.  But if I play the same video using my Web browser on the YouTube site, I get the full spectrum of 144P, 240P, 360P, 480P, 720P, and 1080P quality options.  I would not mind PowerDVD leaving out some of the lower resolutions, but it should at least offer to play the video at the highest resolution that YouTube offers.  But instead it sometimes would not include the 1080P and/or 720P options that YouTube offers for the video, whereas playing the same video from the Web browser gives me all of those quality options.

The new feature to ""download YouTube videos to play offline"" is partially useful.  The software downloads the YouTube video to its own cache directory in a proprietary format.  So if you were hoping that PowerDVD 16 Ultra can now download YouTube videos as portable AVI or MP4 video files, it does not do this.  There are various Web sites that let you perform online conversion and download of AVI or MP4 files from YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sources.

In order to play ISO images, PowerDVD 16 first needs to install a device driver that creates a virtual drive.  On two ISO images, I found a weird bug where the video would play, but the audio was entirely missing.  But if I mount these same two ISO files using Daemon Tools Lite and then play the ISO image on the virtual drive that Daemon Tools Lite created, PowerDVD 16 then plays the audio normally.  So if you are not getting any audio from an ISO image being played by PowerDVD 16, try mounting the ISO file using Daemon Tools first, and then using PowerDVD 16 to play the ISO image mounted on the Daemon Tools' virtual drive, instead of directly playing the ISO image using PowerDVD 16.  If you plan to frequently play various ISO images during a single viewing session, it is faster to use Daemon Tools to mount the ISO images.  PowerDVD 16 takes awhile to mount each ISO image before it can play the ISO file.  You see its busy-icon spinning on the screen while it creates a virtual drive to mount the ISO image.  When you click the [Stop] button, the ISO image is unmounted and the virtual drive is removed.  And then when you play a different ISO file, you have to wait again while it creates a new virtual drive.  This delay is okay if you are just playing one ISO file.  But if you want to play multiple ISO files in a quick sequence, it is quicker to start up Daemon Tools and use it to mount each ISO file before playing the files in PowerDVD by accessing the virtual drives created by Daemon Tools.  I think PowerDVD's handling of ISO images would have fewer delays if it did not remove its virtual drive after the playback of each ISO image is stopped.  Ideally, after the first ISO image is played, the PowerDVD virtual drive should be retained for further use with other ISO files and only removed when PowerDVD is exited.

PowerDVD 16 is advertised for use with Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10.  But I have also been using it on Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) for several weeks now with no problems.  It seems more stable than the previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra that I was using.  PowerDVD 14 Ultra would sometimes crash my computer with the Windows ""Blue Screen Of Death"", but I have not yet experienced a BSOD crash using PowerDVD Ultra 16.

Compared with PowerDVD 14, this version 16 is also far more well-behaved and polished in all areas.  After I installed PowerDVD 14 Ultra two years ago, I discovered that its installation routine quietly changed every file type association to default to PowerDVD, including all video, music, and image file types.  Other software like WinRAR and VLC Media Player politely ask if you want to associate various file types to default to being used by their software, and they let you click or unclick the file types that you want to associate or dissociate with the program.  Now PowerDVD 16's installation process also lets you select which file types to associate with the software, instead of forcing itself onto every file type.  PowerDVD 16 also has subtle improvements in remembering where you last played a video and the folder that you accessed last.

With my previous PowerDVD 14 version, every time that I closed the program, it would always still leave between one and five different processes running in the background that serve no purpose other than to consume memory.  With this PowerDVD 16 Ultra, closing the program usually cleanly ends five of the processes used by the program: clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, PowerDVD.exe, PowerDVD16Agent.exe, and PowerDVDMovie.exe.  It does sometimes leave the clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, or PowerDVD.exe processes still running, which I then manually have to end in Task Manager.  But this happens far less than how the previous version 14 would often leave these programs still running.  Most users will not notice or care about these leftover processes still lingering after the program is closed, but I frequently run CPU-intensive and memory-intensive programs, so I like to minimize the number of unnecessary processes.

As was also the case with PowerDVD Ultra 14, I have not noticed any strict licensing restrictions as I have been able to install PowerDVD 16 Ultra on multiple computers running Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, and 10.

If you are satisfied with the PowerDVD 15 Ultra that you previously installed, unless you can get a great upgrade price, the improvements in going from version 15 to 16 are far less than the improvements in going from version 14 to 15.

And if you are satisfied with using the free VLC media player, this PowerDVD 16 Ultra is quite expensive to get the extra features that you may not need or care about, and PowerDVD consumes a lot more memory than VLC. To me, one of the main convenience features of this PowerDVD version is the ability to directly play ISO images without the need of additional software to mount the ISO image.  But you can use the free version of Daemon Tools Lite to mount ISO images and play them with VLC too. On some slow computers, I have sometimes found VLC to stutter, lag, and drop frames during playback of some video content, whereas PowerDVD appears to utilize much better internal buffering to smooth out the playback and I rarely get dropped frames on PowerDVD.  But for unknown reasons, there are also various videos in MKV and AVI formats that play more smoothly on VLC than on PowerDVD. So for me at least, I like keeping both the latest VLC version 2.2.4 and this PowerDVD 16 Ultra on my Home Theater PC, because neither of these two media players can still play everything with equal smoothness.  But PowerDVD 16 Ultra now plays just about any kind of DVD and Blu-ray format that I throw at it.

So my 5-star rating is based on upgrading my previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra to this version 16.  If I was already using PowerDVD 15 Ultra, I would probably rate this 4 stars for upgrading from version 15 Ultra to 16 Ultra because this version 16 is not as much of an improvement from version 15.  But if you have version 14 or earlier, this version 16 is worth the upgrade.","Great new features and enhancements for me upgrading from PowerDVD 14 Ultra, although there are fewer upgrades from PowerDVD 15.",1461715200,7,

Story-One of your friends, Sally McDonald, has asked you to come help her with a mystery at her house (which is really a log cabin in the middle of nowhere).  She won't tell you over the phone what's scaring her, though, and when you get to her house, she's gone!  You soon find out that dogs with glowing eyes have been attacking her house, and they have scared her away.  You can call her in the game, so don't think she's been kidnapped or something.

Graphics-They were pretty good, and the dogs didn't look that bad.  The characters still need some work, and the backgrounds could be better, but overall, I love the graphics.

Sound-The music has a slight country twist on it, and although I hate country music the music isn't that bad in the game.  The voice acting could have been better, but it's not as bad as it's been before.

Gameplay-The car you drove up in is blocked by a tree that fell down right behind it, so you have to get around via motorboat, which you have to fix first.  Also, there are only 3 characters in the game, so it really gives you the feeling that this is definitely not the city anymore.  Point-and-click is the same.  So is calling Bess and George for hints.  There is a tad bit of history in this game but not as much as in the last game.  Thank goodness!  You have to choose day or night, however, and you don't have an alarm clock in this game.

Fun-Yeah, this is a fun game, but as before mentioned in other reviews, the puzzles don't have much to do with the story, and they revolve a lot around Roman numerals.  The puzzles aren't great, but the story really makes up for it.  Still, the story is not the least bit scary, but it is still a great story.

Length-Not as long as the last one, playing this one through is about 10 hours, but of course, the first time you play it, it will be longer.  It does have a replay value, but the puzzles are rather dull that I just don't bother with this game that much.

They give you an option to register now, while installing, or to enter the key without going through the registration process, which is nice.  While I'm on the subject, wouldn't it be nice to not have to register programs I paid money for?  Anyway, installation went without a hitch.  There is a file called ""manifest""-something that takes a really long time to unpack but I waited it out and the rest of the files installed eventually.  I wish there was a way to download the latest version online.  I checked on the Corel/Pinnacle website but couldn't find anything unless you purchased the program directly from them.  Fortunately, the update to the latest version was only 50MB as of the time of this review.

Pinnacle Studio 16 users may want to note that the manual was still named ""Pinnacle Studio 16 Manual""

When you start, you are presented the option to import files or add files to a watchlist.  Your initial setup may take a little bit because each video file seems to take 3-4 seconds per video for Pinnacle to process.  I'm not sure what it's doing, but anyone with a lot of content will need to wait a while before digging in to the actual player.  Once the files are added, you are brought to the main screen with a file explorer, preview player, and a media timeline that is largely similar to Sony Vegas.

I gave this program three stars because they do come with a nice suite of content you can use but the main guts of the program is slow and a little unwieldy compared to Sony Vegas.  For instance, when you first drop a piece of video content on your timeline you actually have to wait a while before editing.  Why?  Because Pinnacle needs to do some kind of prerendering so you can view your actions and results on the video player.  If you don't wait, anything you preview skips around so much that the video player is useless.  When you drop a file on to Sony Vegas, the wait is seconds.  In Pinnacle, the wait can take minutes.  This is frustrating for anyone on a deadline.

I tend to record using FRAPS because it can record games and take screenshots in higher quality than most programs.  I also tried an old client of PlayClaw; a similar program I don't use anymore.  In practice, I found FRAPS videos work (after the annoying prerendering cycle) but Playclaw videos are missing audio.

I found most of the default rendering settings to be stuck in the 20th century since many of the rendering presets were no higher than 720p.  Fortunately, they do include advanced options for some of the video codecs that are intuitive enough to figure out and I was able to change the resolution, audio sampling, and video bitrate without trouble.  Unfortunately, Pinnacle does not give you the option to save these settings (!) so you will have to enter them over and over.

The meat of the program is how fast videos are rendered compared to competing programs.  I took a two minute 1080p video clip recorded by FRAPS and set is to render the same resolution.  Using MPEG2, it took four minutes to render on my i7-920 CPU with a nVidia GTX 760 video card.  Using MPEG4, the same file took 10 minutes to render!  The compression was more significant in the resulting MPEG4 file but I found both formats to have unacceptable results with lots of jagged lines and difficult to read text; even at a 30Mbps bitrate.

I couldn't find a MPEG2 codec to compare Pinnacle with Sony Vegas, but I was able compare MPEG4.  The file loaded and was ready to render in three seconds (Pinnacle took three minutes!), and the MPEG 4 rendered in 6 minutes versus Pinnacle's 10.  The resulting file weighed in at a heftier 450MB vs. Pinnacle's 64MB, but the quality of this resulting file was much, much better without the jaggies and blurry text I found while using Pinnacle.

With WMV, I was able to get more exacting comparison between the two programs.  Unfortunately, Pinnacle would not let me edit the settings in the advanced options for WMV so I had to record in 720p.  To give both programs a workout, I asked them to record in the same 60 frames per second as the original video.  For anyone who is interested, the specific settings were 720p/60 1280x720 (5Mbit/s), Audio 16-bit, 48kHz (192 kbit/sec).  I forced Sony Vegas to use matching settings with Windows Video 11/Windows Audio 9.  Pinnacle didn't let on what version they were using.

The results:  Pinnacle rendered a 81.8MB file in 6 minutes, 10 seconds while  Sony Vegas rendered an 82.5MB files in 9 minutes, 5 seconds, a victory for Pinnacle!  Just remember, Pinnacle doesn't support 1920x1080p resolution, just 1920x1080i, and for some reason they don't want you fiddling with the settings. That's a big deal for me although it may not be for you. Also keep in mind, the time you save rendering will be spent waiting for each video clip you drop to be prerendered.  As for the quality of the two videos,  I have to give the edge to Sony Vegas.  The Pinnacle video, while better than the MPEG2 and MPEG4 results, still had some jagged lines on items that moved.  Regular sized text was good but small text was still difficult to read.  I'd rate it good.  The Sony Vegas result was excellent with no jaggies and even small text was readable.  I'd rate it Excellent and it may have convinced me to start using this WMV in the future.

I don't work for Sony Vegas and I have nothing to gain from this review except the free copy of Pinnacle I was provided by Amazon for the purpose of this review.  In fact, I have somewhat of a love-hate relationship with Sony Vegas because some of their advertised features don't work correctly and their support is terrible.  I simply wanted to compare the two programs and give you an idea of the differences.  Hopefully the review helped.",It's a decent attempt at video production but Sony Vegas is still the king,1395014400,,

I'm in my 40's now, but I studied Spanish in my junior high and high-school years. Although it may be true that you never forget how to ride a bike, a language that languishes is soon forgotten. My Spanish has grown mighty rusty.

I had no idea at all what to expect from Rosetta Stone. Studying Spanish in school was, needless to say, an academic exercise, and I still remember my early days, learning the pronunciation of Spanish vowels and some of the other letters (like &ntilde;) that are not used in the English language. I imagined the process of learning those same things on a computer being exceedingly boring.

To my surprise, Rosetta Stone skips those basic language lessons, and skips right to, well, total immersion. The entire program is in Spanish, without English text or translations beyond those on the menu page. Rosetta Stone teaches with pictures; you learn to associate Spanish words with familiar pictures. And you do so over and over again.

The program ""mixes up"" the lessons enough to keep them interesting. It can use a microphone (included) to check your pronunciation; it shows plenty of pictures for you to choose from for each Spanish word, and includes lessons on spelling and sentence structure as well.

  The tiny Colors and Mixer palettes are resizable. All the color controls are in a single palette, and if you hover the mouse over the color wheel, a tooltip pops up, displaying accurate values for the currently selected color.

  You can save individual color profiles for all Painter documents, and Painter recognizes embedded profiles when opening documents in these formats. Color profiles are essential for maintaining color consistency across applications.

  If your tablet supports tilt detection, you can control the stroke width merely by changing the brush angle; the further the tilt is from vertical, the wider the stroke. You can even use the side of your pencil for soft shading, just as you would with a real pencil.

  The velocity control acts realistic, the faster you move your pen, the thinner the stroke becomes.

  Also, a set of brushes designed to emulate real-world markers. The initial stroke produces an even color on the paper; additional strokes build up and darken the color.

One, the process of importation is NOT intuitive and is made far more difficult than it should be.  Whoever designed this interface is not a Mac user.

5512,5,False,"02 7, 2011",ATJE929ETFFNH,B004Y8MKZM,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Fred Woodbridge,"My Norton Internet Security (NIS) just expired so it was opportune that I had another security suite on hand to fill its rather large shoes. I really liked NIS, from the simplicity of its interface, how low a memory and CPU footprint it occupied, and its features.

The installation for Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 (KIS) went exceedingly well and I was up and running in next to no time at all. I don't recall it asking me to perform a pre-installation anti-virus check like other security suites I've tried. I don't mind that, actually because I'd just uninstalled NIS and felt relatively secure leaving the PC (a Windows 7 x64 machine, by the way) unprotected until KIS was installed, but you may want to check this out.
The DVD has the ability to create a ""Rescue Disk"" which I have used in the past to destroy malware that had brushed aside McAfee's security suite like a child. If you find yourself in such a situation, Kasperky's Rescue Disk is highly recommended--especially when you consider that if you have a `net connection, it will update itself before running a scan! This also is officially my non-recommendation of McAfee, by the way.

I was happy to note that KIS's interface is just as simple and easy-to-navigate as NIS and unlike Bit Defender, doesn't have the feature of allowing you to choose different ways to provide information based on the user's technical acumen. I haven't made up my mind yet whether I like that feature as it adds a level of management complexity that perhaps one doesn't need.

The `Protection Center' has three sub-sections: `File and Private Data Protection', `System and Applications Protection' (which has some really interesting features I'll talk about in a moment), and `Online Security'. Digging deeper into the `File and Private Data Protection' shows `File Anti-Virus', `Application Control' and `Proactive Defense'. These names are easy to understand and don't have the often confusing techno-babble you find (""heuristics"", for example).

Clicking on `File Anti-Virus' brings up a drop-down menu from which you may choose to modify the settings for the anti-virus. A new window gives the user the capability to change all sorts of settings, from the normal anti-virus to mail anti-virus, web anti-virus, firewall and even--my favorite--anti-banner. There's enough here for just about every taste, it seems!

The settings are well outlined and easy to set with most of them check boxes. Proactive Defense, for example, protects the computer from the most recent threats (also known as zero-day) even, as it says on the settings window, ""even those not yet registered in the anti-virus database.' I like this very much because there are too many exploits that many anti-virus software either can't or don't catch. What does this mean with respect to Kaspersky? Well, there are some changeable, default rules that KIS watches for such as: P2P worm-like activity, Trojan-like activity, Keyloggers, Hidden driver install, Hidden object, Hidden process (with negative PID, or process ID), worm-like activity, Input/output redirection. For many home users, all this can be overwhelming, but on every page, there's a handy `Help' button that brings up the KIS help file which explains what each setting is, but I would recommend simply leaving the defaults check. Great feature!

Application Control is one of the best features of KIS 2011 in my opinion. This feature classifies all applications and restricts their behavior based on their security status. KIS automatically locates and identifies all the applications running on the machine and assigns them a security status based on its own database, and a world-wide database of users in terms of popularity, the thinking being that if millions of users have used this piece of software, it should be relatively safe.

In the Trusted group exists such software as Microsoft's, Google's, etc. Then comes the Low Restricted, High Restricted and finally Untrusted. This way, KIS sort of quarantines software it isn't completely comfortable with and puts them in a virtual sandbox so to speak.

Here's yet another two features I really like: the Safe Run for Websites which runs a ""jailed"" version of your default web browser so that should you visit a site which may attempt a drive-by malware download, your PC doesn't get taken over. And how do you know it's safe? KIS puts a glowing green neon bar around the browser! Sweet. The other is the Virtual Keyboard that protects you as you enter passwords, banking information and personal data from keyloggers.

Rounding out, you have the ability to control other users' accounts on the PC through the Parental Control panel. The Scan panel gives the user the ability to set up system scans either manually or on a schedule. The Update Center of course controls how often updates to KIS occur, a simple process quite unlike Bit Defender's which often hangs.
So as  you can probably tell, the features on KIS 2011 are vast but not overwhelming. Every setting is easy to reach and configure. The vast help file is quite helpful and the system reports are easy to understand.
The only thing left to talk about is performance. None of this will matter if you can't use your system while it's locked down. Well, from looking at the status information for KIS as it's running, I'm very pleased to find that system overhead is very low, even at high load. For example, as I type this, CPU usage has been fluctuating between 0.68 and 2.74 with a working set memory of about 30MB. Wonderful.

Firing up my 30-tab Chrome temporarily increased the CPU to 25.77 but after stabilizing, it came back down to fluctuating  between 1.95 to 5.73. In summary, if you couldn't tell already, I'm happy with KIS 2011 and proclaim it a worthy successor to NIS. Great piece of software.","Stable, low-overhead Security Software",1297036800,,

We use both word and WP in the office only because we need to communicate with other firms. I give our people  the choice of using word or WP for internal communications. Over the last decade or so most of the employees came to the company knowing only word. A requirement was that they learn enough WP to be proficient in both.

The outcome is that almost every employee scoffed at WP at first and then learned how elegant it is and in the end adopted it as the word processor of choice. My guess is that the output is 150% - 200% of word. Of equal importance is the vastly reduced probability that the word processing software will suddenly get an overwhelming desire to reformat your document, thus trashing hours of work.

In some ways Cyberlink Photodirector is a great program and in some ways it is a frustrating program to use.

Why frustrating?

PhotoDirector is very good for making adjustments to photos (white balance, tone, HDR, Clarity, Vibrance etc..)

Where PhotoDirector is weak is in the editing department.

PhotoDirector is missing a true clone tool.  This is a major oversight.  Cyberlink essentially copied Adobe Lightroom tools.  However, If Cyberlink wants to win business they have to be clearly superior to the current leader.  Currently, PhotoDirector is not.  A true clone tool with selectable brush styles, angles and sizes would be a good start.

The need to import photos is a pain, I already have my folder structure established.  I don't know why the latest photo programs insist that they also manage your photos.  None of them come close to the free Google Picasa for this task.

Finally, Photodirector prompts you to save every time you switch from the Editing Tab to the Adjustment Tab.  Why?  Instead remind me to save when I am finished editing and and ready to move to another photo.

Conclusion:

Cyberlink is a good company with a history of improving their products.  I am hopeful they will fix these issues and produce and must have product.

What is a must have product?

A photo editor that combines a mixture between the adjustment features of PhotoDirector 4 or Adobe Lightroom with the photo editing abilities of PaintShop Pro or Adobe Photoshop elements.

As always, Family Tree Maker is a solid product and worth the investment. The feature suite is rich and it gets the job done nicely. Where my real complaint lies is the map. This has been a feature that's been in the last few iterations of FTM and, while I love the idea, the implementation drives me bonkers.

The idea behind the mapping feature is that you can attach people and events to actual locations on a map. It's great for setting up to-do lists, getting a visual look at your family history, and so on. The problem, however, is with formatting. I have yet to figure out what it insists locations be entered as they are. For instance, I have ancestors buried in a cemetery in ""Baileyville"" TX. This is, of course, how I've entered them. FTM, however, doesn't like ""Baileyville, TX"" and gives me a ""?"" beside any entries. Basically, it can't find ""Baileyville"" in its database. And yet, on the map view, it drops the pin right on--you guessed it--Baileyville, TX! So it can't find Baileyville, TX in its database, but seems to find it just fine on the map. Go figure. At others times, it will insist on a County for a location and, even when I duly enter it in, will still kick it back as being somehow wrong. There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to when a location will be kicked back as unrecognized. This is sad, too, because the feature is really nice when it works. It's helped me clear up some sloppy editing (like when I once entered ""Grimes Co, TX (Last name was spelled <edited>.  Age was given as 64.  Occupation listed as farmer.  Real estate value listed as $47,000.)"" for a location!)

Perhaps I shouldn't be so harsh, but this is a feature that's advertised prominently and has been around for years. There are ways around these issues, but none of them feel reliable to me (and ancestry software should be reliable above anything). If they could fix these map problems, I'd give it 5 stars in a minute. Until then, however, I'm keeping the pressure on.

I started out skeptical -- and have to admit I was making it hard from the start -- but after two lessons with Rosetta Stone I was actually starting to enjoy learning French!

Rosetta isn't like tradition language classes.  You don't try to memorize words and phrases.  No, they do away with all that nonsense.

It does way too much to mention here, but photo manipulation is made incredibly easy. It has  loads of preset adjustments that are easy to try out and  select. It also automatically saves your original file just in case.......
It can convert fairly ordinary photos into HD wonders, it can also slim down body's,,smooth skin and remove blemishes. Like a lot of photo editing software, it can organize photos (one of the feature I did not use) and do es too much to mention.
This software will be ideal for someone who wants to quickly enhance  photos but has little experience with editing software. It is easy to install and set-up. It does not use layers, which makes it easy for novices.

There is also has a mobile version (at the time of writing was only available for windows 8 tablets) which works well on my Surface Pro tablet.

So I obviously recommend getting the newer edition for the same. But I have not tested X5, so here are my comments on X4:

I have always loved WordPerfect, and as expected I love X4. For almost 2 decades now, WordPerfect has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and in my opinion it's much better than Microsoft Word or putting together a quick Word document.

I also strongly recommend Open Office, an open source, completely free office suite. I've used Open Office almost exclusively for the past 5 years, and it's great for ""light"" word processing, and it's spreadsheet is more than adequate. However, if you are a heavy user, need templates like label templates (Open Office is not great at this), or need somewhat sophisticated word processing functions (like image integration), WordPefect is hands-down the best in my opinion.

Additionally, WordPerfect opens any PDF into Word Perfect. It saves in just about any format (including .docx). Others have touted the optical character recognition (OCR) feature, which can convert a scan to text. This in itself is actually not a big deal - almost every scanner has bundled software that can do this. But having it build into the word processor means you can take a JPG image (such as a scanned receipt) & convert it back into text.

If you already have X4, I doubt that I would actually recommend upgrading to X5 - I don't plan on it. But if you're looking for a new word processor, I would suggest checking out X5. As for X4, I give it an easy 5-stars.",Great ... but already outdated. X5 is available for the same price,1306281600,,

On the one hand, I feel that everyone needs some form of protection on their PC - but on the other hands, it is a really big moneymaker for the various companies.

Before I begin on this product, let me explain why I am not a fan of paid AV packages - first of all, there are many great free alternatives. Microsoft Security Essentials is an amazing FREE product, made by the people that made your operating system, so they obviously know a thing or two about protection.

That said, paid AV packages do have one advantage - support. With a free package, you are on your own if you need support from the developers. So, if you can live with solving the occasional support issue yourself, check out a free package. Otherwise, a program like Trend Micro Internet Security is a great option.

Trend is a good reliable product. I feel that they haven't taken the bloated and slow route McAfee and Norton took in recent years - the app does not visibly slow down my machine. Testing security is also a tough one - I have no intention of tracking down an infected site or file just to prove a point.

The price was so low (compared to Adobe Illustrator, the only competition) that examples of Corel would show up in ordinary office documents, like the ""Word-Art"" equivalents as headlines.

But that was then. Nowadays Corel is, unfortunately, a second-string company, eclipsed by the Adobe Empire. But also the market has changed. There are millions of digital photographers, seduced by the promise of ""No developing - pictures immediately."" That's a market that's served by plenty of programs these days, and it's not as easy as it once was to make a name for yourself.

The market has several free and low-cost options which are simplified versions of major programs like Photoshop. Photoshop is my weapon of choice, but I'd be the first to admit that it's way too complicated for the average snap-shooter to understand. In many cases people just want to remove red-eye from flash, and have some easy way to sort their pictures.

Even Photoshop Elements is over the heads of many users, so the best choice for one's mythical ""grandparents"" are those free and low-cost programs for under $50. There are numerous options, including photo manipulating programs that come for free to download, or free with an operating system or camera. To succeed in this area a program will have to be better than the others.

Unfortunately Corel Paint Shop Photo Express just isn't different enough. Other reviewers have compared it to Picasa (free) and other cheap options. The interface simplifies tasks, but so do the interface in many similar programs. Free programs like Windows Live Photo Gallery and Picasa have advanced features like face recognition, which I couldn't find in the Corel offering.

So why is Corel's offering here? My only guess is that some unscrupulous salespeople in the big electronic stores will mention to a new purchaser of a Windows 7 computer that ""it doesn't come with Photo-Editing software."" They then point the buyer to a row of Photo-Editing software that they can sell to the unsuspecting, because you can download Windows Live Photo Gallery from Microsoft for free. It's not in Windows 7 so that other companies can get a shot at this market, but I think you'll find that the Microsoft offering is better than Corel's.

It asks you to fill out a few basic questions and asks for the size of the estate. And then it emails your request for review to the attorney.  I haven't gotten past this step.

After all, people who get Office 2008 are commonly those who have used the Windows version of Office and need to continue working with those files.  Say what you will about iWork, it's not perfect in that arena.  When dealing with school work and business assignments that call for these features, it's just not acceptable to deal with anything but the best, and in those arenas, Office reigns supreme.

A lot of this is based on my personal experience.  It really boils down to four things.

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY SLOW.  I don't even mean slightly laggy.  I mean SLOW.  TO the point you wonder if anyone did any QA on it before releasing it.  They're not even bloated apps either, not even Entourage, so it's boggling as to why the apps are as slow as they are.  Excel is by far the worst offender in the bunch.

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY BUGGY.  I speak more to Word and Excel than Powerpoint or Entourage.  Excel is known to lock up after a fashion.  Word has frozen on me on more than one occasion, the latest being right at the closing stages of a book I'd written (obviously unacceptable).

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY CONVOLUTED.  If you've used 2003, you know it's a matter of memorizing toolbar and menu positions.  If you've used 2007 you know it's getting familiar with the Ribbon, mostly.  2008, I don't know what they were thinking.  The Toolbox just takes all of the needed features and bulks them under a clunky structure that makes it difficult to get to the simplest of tasks.  I know they plan to fix this with 2011, and I certainly hope they take note of what they did with 2007 and 2010, because 2008 feels archaic even now.

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.  Given it doesn't include a full flavor of Outlook, and how clunky, buggy, and slow it really is, and given the fact that iWork is significantly lower, it's confusing to me why Microsoft feels the need to price this so high.

IN summary, I recommend it for its interoperability, but ONLY if you need that.  If you're just trying to compile docs for school and your own files, choose iWork instead.  The only thing you lose is mail, but the built in Mail app is more than enough for the majority of applications.

Installation: This should have been an easy simple process, and mostly it was but there were a few hiccups. The installation wizard gives you a choice between 32 bit or 64 bit and pretty much no guidance as to how to make that choice. The geeky part of me hit the 64 bit because well I figured I could use the extra memory access. Well, choosing 64-bit is not just hitting a button and then installing. The installation program actually has you leave the set-up process and locate another file to set-up. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it's not smooth and could cause an issue for those a little less tech inclined. The other issue is 64 bit Office has some compatibility issues, especially with add-ons. Since I am not using this in a work environment where huge files could benefit from the 64 bit advantages, I just went with 32 not to worry about it, and 64 2010 would not install with 2007 32 bit without spending more time online figuring out the tricks how to.

First, I want to make a note about compatibility, I am not talking about OS compatibility but other versions of Office. Between my three computers, I have Office XP, 2007 and of course, 2010. In addition I have used 97 and 2003. Now getting 2007 to work happily with XP wasn't a problem. The two-coexist with no problems at all and seem to ignore the fact that the other exists. 2007 and 2010... this is not the case. It will allow you to install them both of course, but that's about where the cooperation begins. Yes, you can access files from either but each time you switch from 2007 or 2010 the other program wants to run a set-up configuration. This is not a slow process. Searching online I see you can install to a different folder and perhaps avoid some of these issues, but when I review a product, I do so as a standard user. I'll do the geeky stuff later.

After the installation, I jumped into Word because that is the program I will use the most at home. I do a bit of creative writing so I have some fairly large, 100's of pages long, documents. Now the one thing I hated immediately is how much longer it takes me in 2010 to switch from one recent document to another. In 07 it's very easy, right off the ""Office Button"" and boom there it is. With 2010 I have to go to the File tab and then drop down to the Recent area since the default is a bunch of info on the document you are currently editing.  This info tab has a lot of info and a lot of utility as well to do things like change the compatibility of the document, add tags, permissions, a whole host of stuff that would be more useful to me in a work environment but at home, I just want my recent documents very handy. Fortunately, Windows 7 keeps track of that very well instead.

One very good feature that encounter in 2010 that almost makes up for this tiny little annoying thing I encountered above is the new search feature that lets preview you about 3 and half lines of the sentence of the word you are searching for is just awesome, I mean really awesome to see this list. There is a limitation though, at some point this new search future decides there are too many matches as a result, won't show you any of these partial sentences which is just so... sad.

I also played around with Excel a bit, as I use that in work environments for formulas, pivot tables and just standard things that you would expect. The ribbon changes found in Word can also be found in Excel and the other programs, here is the thing though. The differences between 2007 and 2010 are rather minute. My complaints and praises could easily bother other people so it's a bit of a personal preference issue. If you are using the older versions, not 2007, then 2010 is as good a point as any to move on over and enjoy the expanded memory usages, extra rows and just generally easy to use features. You could also go 2007 and not have a problem. If you like 2007, like I do, but want easier ways to set permissions, compatibilities, share your work and, finally, have a chance to change around your toolbars and better customization in general, 2010 is for you... you're still going to have to use ribbons though which I don't mind one bit. For the rest of you using 2007, unless you have money to burn or a very specific need not being met, there isn't a whole lot to justify the cost.

Oh, I almost forget, being able to preview your past before you actually paste, that, that is almost as nice as the search preview and could be the tilting point for a number of you as you can monkey around with things before you paste and have to undo it what you just did. This is a time save and a very nice option.

Lastly, yes OneNote works with Win 7 64. I was one of those people who switched Win 7 64 and suddenly discovered that my OneNote ""printing"" capability was just gone. It was an unfortunate surprise for me anyway.

You are provided with computer program discs, audio discs and a headset.
The lessons consist of a visual/audio response setting. You are shown some beautiful pictures/photos and are provided examples of speech by either native or expert language speakers. You are expected to repeat what you are told. You are also expected to remember what you previously learned.
Rosetta Stone is not intended to teach you to be able to read nor write the language, especially with non-Roman character sets. There is some support  for the more graphic character sets (Kanji, Hiragana), but with only an English keyboard, your typing will be with Roman characters in a phonetic Japanese.
What is lacking? Specific language syntax. When sentence structure varies from your native language you can get very confused constructing your own prose. (This would be necessary to learn to write in a foreign tongue, which is not an objective here.)
Overall this is a simple approach to allow you to learn to speak a foreign language as a native child might be taught to speak (recognition, repetition and intuition.)
Including the ""audio companion"" discs was a good idea. When you are away from your computer you can listen to the discs (or upload them to your iPod, or other media player) and practice some more.",Is This The Rosetta Stone of Language Learning?,1229472000,,

I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.

Pros:
Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional ""current language word = foreign language word"" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.

The software is divided into ""lessons"" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.

The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.

Cons of Rosetta Stone:
-Higher price
-The approach in rosetta stone does not use conjugations or grammar rules, you just learn words and phrases.  Some maybe bothered by this.

What I like:  Money 2003 is much more code-efficient than Money 2002 (which was a terrible performer -- even on a fast 2 gig Pentium), so everything is quicker:  reports run quickly, data entry is quick, and budget changes are quick.  Secondly, Money 2003 didn't remove key functionality that its predecessors sometime did -- so if you use an older version of Money, the features you like are still there.  Thirdly, you can batch epayments together and send them all at once (conversely, Money 2002 sent a payment by piecemeal, which was extremely slow and frustrating).  Fourthly, a good product has been tweaked to iron-out some of the frustrations of earlier versions.  In all -- it's a nice piece of software.
What I don't like:  So far, I like everything I've seen.  If there is something you don't like about Money, in all likelihood, there is an Options setting that will correct the problem.  For example, to remove ""sponsor"" ads from within Money, find the option setting to stop displaying all sponsor's ads (by default, they'll show up).  Also, when upgrading from an earlier version of Money, the newly-installed Money 2003 installation isn't smart enough to know that you already have a Money file that you want to just pick-up and use.

I have upgraded each year without any problems.  This version despite the hyped up marketing is far from stable.  I do not have confidence in Quicken 2016 and am reverting back to Quicken 2015.

I got tired of it crashing when I opened files, the bizarre and irritating ""recovery"" mode, not being able to scroll in files, and so on.  OpenOffice has made great strides, but for non-trivial Word or PowerPoint inter-op or even just basic features with 3 on the Mac, it's just not there yet.

So I took the plunge and bought the real thing.

I haven't used the MS Office apps for some time, but lately I've needed to do some serious doc creation with them.  This is by far the best Office--I did consider buying 2007 to use on Vista, but the UI changes on the Windows version are too confusing.

I've had no inter-op problems with this version of Office and 2003 and 2007 on Windows, for both PowerPoint and Word.  Note that with the missing scripting in Excel, this Office version is not quite full-featured, and that costs it a star.  Furthermore, there's still stuff in Office that doesn't keep up with the simplicity of Pages and Keynote--Editing table cell borders is still a pain, aligning pictures in PowerPoint is tedious, and so on.

If you're fighting with OpenOffice and wondering why it's so slow and crash-prone, upgrade to the real thing.  If you're coming from previous versions, know that this is, by and large, pretty stable and fast.  I am puzzled why saving a 30 slide PowerPoint takes a good 30 seconds on my Mac Pro (it's so annoying I had to turn off auto-save), and Word and PowerPoint both do crash sometimes--but this is a great solution for those documents that need to be shared with others and thus Pages and Keynote do not get the job done.","Best Office yet; a relief after ""making do"" with OpenOffice",1244592000,,

I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes. The program takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.
I'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation. Bad job Intuit. However, the activation doesn't prevent you from installing on more than one computer but it does prevent you from printing or electronically filing from the second computer. Still, you can take your saved file from work or where ever and bring it home to print or file.
I tried Taxcut this year because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).

So I used a TV with a capture card to capture other sources and upscale them for the new TV.  And I've not been without a computer on the TV since.  Once Windows Media Center came out in the early days of Windows XP, I was in heaven.

So for me, I need something like this to play my blu ray content.  I have PlayStation 3 and 4, as well as the Xbox One, that can play DVD's, but I don't like the interfaces, even when using my Logitech Harmony remote with the Xbox One.  I've always preferred actual discs be played in my computer.  More options for me to do things.

I also have a ton of movies and TV shows in MKV format.  I never bothered worrying about playing them on my iPads and such.  I didn't need them THAT portable, I have a TV in the only two rooms I'm likely to want to watch something.  But when I got PowerDVD 13, I found that the media server worked very well for my iPads and even iPod touch and iPhone.  It was great that my son could pull up all the cartoons I have saved on my media server anytime he wanted with his iPad.  I was able to play my 3D blu rays as well without any problems, and my standard DVD's looked very good.  It did everything I wanted.

So I had hopes for the version 14.  But while the basics work fine, such as DVD playback, Blu Ray playback, or even using the free PowerDVD remote on my mobile devices to duplicate a touchpad to control the mouse, the one thing I had come to appreciate, the transcoding for remote devices, totally does not work.

I have the app on my iPad, and the iPad can see my computer in the list, but it won't connect anymore like it did in version 13.  It just errors out and says it can't connect.  Or sometimes it will connect, and all I see is an empty folder.  When I look at the computer that the software is installed on and look at the media it is offering up, I see all my files listed without any issues.  Firewall is turned off, there's nothing blocking any access.  From other computers I can still just map the network drive and play things fine, but from the Power Media Player on my iPad, I get nothing.

Since that was a bonus feature that I ended up enjoying, but not something critical for my base functionality, I'm not losing sleep over it, nor wasting time more than the 20 minutes I already spent trying to resolve it.  I just wrote it off as a feature that clearly doesn't work as well as it used to in the previous version.  I'm guessing part of the issue may be that this full version isn't smart enough to see a previous version and just UPGRADE the existing version, but it installs as a separate program.  That was a pain at the beginning, and I ended up uninstalling all the Version 13 components to help alleviate any conflicts from this poor install routine.  I'm guessing that I may be able to overcome some of my issues if I were to nuke it all off of my computer, and just do a clean install of version 14 now that version 13 doesn't exist anymore, but it's just not worth the hassle.  If they can't write their programs well enough to accommodate existing users who upgrade from one version to the next if they end up with a full version of the newer version, then I figure I will spend my time and money and effort with someone else's solution who does want to make the experience as trouble free as possible.

If you're looking for a way to watch DVD's and blu ray discs on your computer, this will work.  But I'd go with the lowest cost version for what your needs are.  If I had paid for this version, I would've wanted my money back.  As it was free, I'll just leave it alone and just use it to watch discs as needed, if I don't just ditch it altogether and start using the Xbox One for my Blu Ray playback instead...",Works well in my environment,1403308800,,

Facing increasing pressure to get ""something"" out the door, and having gone through several failed attempts to unleash a modern operating system to replace the aging, original Macintosh operating system, Apple threw OS X (10.0) at dedicated Mac users as, essentially, a pay-to-play beta test.  Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.  At lease Apple was kind enough to tell people that 10.0 was not for everyone and was going to be revised substantially.

But as a long time user of Dragon, the updates aren't exactly mind blowing.  The Dragon toolbar, the better integration with apps, etc. is all fine and good but it's just slight.  The only compelling reason I've found is that the Windows 8 computer seems to work better somewhat.  But if you're using Dragon 12 on Windows 8 fine then you probably aren't using the features that you'd notice.

If you're totally new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking, it's an excellent piece of software that will translate your words into text.  The newest versions even allow mouse control.  (I know that 12 also did this.)  So you can go totally hands-free.  Just find a quiet space to work, configure it to your voice and away you go without using your hands at all.  I do find that it's easier to do without others in the room and I have not had great experiences trying the software on the bus/train/coffee shop.  Plus talking to your computer does tend to make others stare at you.  But at home or in an office it's great.  I've also been able to record to a recorder and then input into Dragon, but it's less successful than live voice into Dragon.  I've tried a few recorders and it always suffers from ambient sound noise.  A laptop just seems to work better for me than recorders.

I've used this software for dozens of setups for those with disabilities and injuries.  It's amazing how productive you can be without the use of your hands.  A very, very small investment to save your wrists.  And you really don't have to tweak this version much at all to get it to recognize your voice.  I really love it.  One key is to use an accurate microphone.  I use the Sennheiser ME 3-EW headset EW microphone http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-ME-3-EW-headset-microphone/dp/B002FOFW52/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1410457352&sr=8-16&keywords=dragon+microphone right now and it's great.  But there are cheaper alternatives that appear to be just as good.

Basically Dragon is very similar to Adobe Acrobat Pro in that it's a wonderful application that works.  But it's not one that you really need to upgrade every year.  If you aren't using Dragon now and want hands-free computing then this is what you need.  I will say that I've always found the Premium version to be worth the extra investment, no matter what version I got.  The Home versions are just too limited IMHO.

One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.

With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.

Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec. Nevertheless, despite these pitfalls, as long as I can keep upgrading for free and my systems remain virus-free, Norton is my source for internet security and virus protection.

This makes it very flexible in that you can capture footage from just about any device that might be used in your home:  phones, camcorders, GoPros, etc.  Then you can watch your results on an equally impressive array of devices aimed at fitting everyone's needs - if the kids want to watch on their Xbox, no problem; if you want to share with Grandma via Facebook, fine; if your team posts their highlight clips to YouTube or Vimeo, you can do that.  This flexibility is a threshold requirement these days and Pinnacle Studio is definitely up to speed.

The editing process is simple but powerful.  I've used several different home editing suites and always come back to Pinnacle due to the simplicity of the on-screen interface and controls.  I'm able to make great-looking videos that get lots of ""wow - how did you do that?"" comments without having to fumble around indefinitely figuring out how to do this transition or drop in that graphic.  That, coupled with its affordability make it a great choice for anyone looking to quickly make family movies, team highlight reels, etc.

I did have some hiccups during installation (Windows 8), but Pinnacle's customer service was able to help me get past it.

I'm still okay with the Win 8 desktop mode but I'm now officially in the hate camp on the metro, New Windows Interface, or whatever that rubbish is called.  Before anyone gives me grief, hear me out.  I've given metro more than enough chances to win me over.  I just can no longer take this Frankenstein version of Windows trying to be all things to all people, tablet and PC.  It's a gimmick and one with irritating repercussions.  Take a recent email for example.  I had to send an immediate response to someone with attachments.  I replied in Windows mail (since it was conveniently there), went to insert attachments and found there was no way to do so.  I did my usual edge of the screen mouse hovering and saw everything from charms, to running programs, to the metro option, but nothing for attachments.  I had to back out of mail and search the web for the answer.  I learned I have to right-click an empty area of the message to bring up a sub-menu on the bottom (not even the normal context menu) that has more options, including inserting attachments.  If I had a touchscreen, all I would have needed to do was swipe.  Therein lies the problem.  Microsoft spent so much time catering to the tablet and touch crowd, they ruined a lot of the traditional desktop functionality in this mode.  What was previously a fast paced mouse clicking, keyboard shortcut typing paradise has been turned into a mess.  I really wish they gave us the option to choose between whether or not we want all that touch garbage installed at all.  I definitely would keep it off my PC and save the space.  It's just not worth the aggravation.  Sure, it's cutesy and all, with it's colorful tiles and live content, but navigation, usability, and usefulness are minimal.  I live in the desktop environment and that's all I want.  So to that end, I'll be going back to Windows 7 for as long as Microsoft supports it.  Just in case this is the new permanent mindset of Microsoft, I invested in a backup.  After being primarily a Windows user for over twenty years, I bought my first MacBook this past fall.  I'd tinkered with OSX and Linux here and there and even own an older iMac, but after trying the release previews of Windows 8 extensively, I figured if I had to learn a radically different OS design, I may as well make the switch to the least radically changed OS. Looks like my gamble paid off.  I am neither an Apple lover (because believe me, they have their issues too), nor a Microsoft lover but I definitely have to agree with Tim Cook's quote, a spot-on assessment of Windows 8:  ""I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do all of those things very well.""  In trying to compete with both the iPad and iMac in one swoop, Windows gave up their biggest advantage.  This can only help Linux and OSX.

That sums up my feelings of Windows 8 exactly. It tries to be a tablet and traditional PC combined but the end result is not very good.  I also wanted to point out, in my initial review I spoke of boot times and claims of incredibly fast boot times from people.  Well, I've recently started experiencing these short boot times myself and discovered it's because Microsoft has implemented a new shut-down scheme.  It's not really a ""shutdown"" in the traditional sense but more like an advanced hibernation mode.  I didn't initially experience these superfast boots but have been noticing them more and more lately.  I'm assuming it's because I'm no longer installing programs and other tasks that extend my boots/reboots.  At first, I thought I was somehow accidentally selecting sleep instead of shutdown.  I checked my event viewer and saw that it never mentions shutdown anymore, only sleep regardless of whether I select ""power off"".  I knew something was up, so I did a little digging and found info about the new boot mode.  There are parameters you can use to perform a true shutdown but once again, MS is forcing a PC to behave like a tablet.  I already have a tablet, so Windows 8 is not really necessary.  My advice, if you have a traditional PC and you're happy with Windows 7, stick with it.  If you primarily use your PC for web browsing, playing games and social activity, then Windows 8 isn't a bad choice, but if you're a power user and use your PC in a more traditional manner, you're likely not going to like it.  By the way, I'm STILL missing a couple drivers.  Last time that happened was Windows Vista.  That brought an interesting thought to mind; see if you recognize the pattern:  Windows 95/98, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.  Notice a trend?  Long time Windows users will notice immediately.
--------------------------------------------------------------

I'm, in the camp with those who neither love nor hate Windows 8.  I decided to upgrade after holding onto my copy of Windows 8 for over two months.  I bought it on Black Friday and just couldn't convince myself to install it, based on my last experience with the final preview version.  Well, I recently discovered that if you don't download and install the Media Center before January 31st, it would no longer be free and you would have to pony up an additional $20 for the ability to download it and have the capability to play DVDs and such.  So, I installed this past weekend and have been playing around with it since.  So far, my feelings about it are mixed.  I do feel that the uproar over metro (the purists will have to forgive me for calling it that, but it has no real distinguishing name, so it will be metro for this review) vs the desktop is much ado about nothing.  I spend 90% of my time in the desktop and have no problem getting there via the big ""desktop"" button on the metro screen or hitting the Start+B buttons.  The start menu is also overblown.  Yes, I was pretty upset at how Microsoft initially hid the programs and all the steps I had to take to get to them, however, once I figured out how to use charms, navigation became as quick and easy as it was with the Start menu.  Also, just to avoid any confusion, the taskbar is still there.  Yes, the date/time and little icons are all still on the right and your quick-launch shortcuts are still on the left.  Only the Start menu is missing.  Although I'm no fan of the metro interface, it does have its moments.  I like seeing mail, calendar, and other events in real-time live tiles.  Comparing the traditional desktop to metro is like the difference between iOS and Android.  Although metro is useful at times, I'd still prefer the choice to not use it so much.  Speaking of live tiles, that's another concern of mine, security.  From what I've read and heard, be very careful what content you put on the computer, especially photos.  I'm honestly leery about placing any photos or other super sensitive info on my PC now that Windows is so cloud-centric.  It's one thing to know that yes, there is a possibility your system could get compromised and your data illegally stolen; It's quite another when your computer is knowingly advertising your content.  My biggest likes of Windows 8 are increased functionality, better security, SOME features of IE 10, like spell-check (welcome to the 21st century, finally IE...), the mail and calendar integration (No Outlook necessary!) and the live tiles.  Another plus is that you don't ""need"" a touchscreen to navigate either interface.  I find navigating with the mouse to be relatively easy and think I'd prefer it even if I did have a touchscreen, other than the hot spots I'll address in the next paragraph.  So, that's pretty much it for now in the like column.

On the flip side, my list of dislikes is quite lengthy.  First, despite running the Windows Upgrade Advisor and being told many programs and drivers were compatible, many were not.  The funny thing is, Windows installed native drivers for devices it claimed needed updating and did not have native drivers for others it claimed were compatible.  After a lot of searching high and low, I found almost all of the drivers but I'm still missing one driver.  Several of my ""compatible"" programs either wouldn't run properly or wouldn't install at all, despite being listed as compatible in the WUA.  My second gripe is with the navigation.  Although you get accustomed to it, some long time Windows users will be pretty miffed at the changes because most are counterintuitive. Quirky requirements like hovering over random edges of the screen to bring up menus and the lack of traditional navigation options.  Also, some features that should be pretty straightforward take a little detective work to figure out, like how to add additional accounts after mail is set up or how to close metro apps like mail, calendar or even the metro version of IE, which is noticeably different from the desktop version.  They also took away some ease of use such as advance settings in networking.  They made it pretty much like a tablet to configure networking. Speaking of tablets, the merge of desktop and metro touch-oriented OS is a little convoluted.  For instance, there are apps that will only work in one or the other.  An example of this is an application I own that I've used in Windows for over a decade.  Well, they also now offer an app store version.  My desktop version only runs in the desktop mode (even if launched from the metro interface) and the app store version only runs in the metro interface, leading me to believe that the app store version (along with many other apps are really geared toward tablets).  If you thought distinguishing phone from tablet apps was hard in Android, wait until you have fun trying to figure out which apps are geared toward tablets versus PCs in the Windows App Store.  Although this is the last complaint I'll type, the list goes on.  My final complaint is the installation process.  Technically, for an upgrade, you must have a previous version of Windows already installed.  I installed on a clean wiped system (my preference always) and was unable to activate Windows after installation.  I called Microsoft and a nice gentleman assisted me with getting it activated via an alternative method.  I hope Microsoft intends to change this in the future because I do not wish to install a prior OS every time I need to rebuild, nor do I trust their ""erase everything and reinstall Windows"" option because if a nasty enough piece of malware hits you, I don't think any part of your disk is guaranteed safe, even hidden restore partitions.

Overall, I don't regret the upgrade but had I not been pressed into upgrading now or losing the free media center, I likely would have stuck with Windows 7 for the foreseeable future.  I haven't personally observed any of the claimed performance gains nor any of the alleged sub-ten-second boot times, although I think the fast booters were booting from sleep mode and not a full power down.  Despite the aforementioned software and driver issues, I have not yet experienced any stability issues but I also haven't really stressed the system yet with some hardcore encoding or gaming.  Once I've had a chance to work out the kinks and truly test the OS, I'll be certain to report any and all issues encountered.",Headaches with few benefits,1359417600,3,

That little omission has now been rectified with this truly elegant version for Mac.  Having used AutoCAD in the Windows OS, I was really excited to see what it would be like on Mac, and not only was I not disappointed, but it exceeded my expectations.  This isn't just a ""port over"" from Windows OS code. This version was built from the ground up specifically for Mac, yet looks and functions just like its Windows cousin, only with the flair and style that is Mac. Great pains have been taken to make the Mac version's interface (i.e, menus, dropdowns, etc.) extremely similar to Windows, so getting up to speed is quick, and you'll instantly know your way around.

The one thing you won't be used to is SPEED.  The Mac version rocks when it comes to performance over the Windows version.  I have the Windows version installed on a PC with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core processor.  My MacBook Pro has the exact same RAM and processor but, as all Mac users know, code written on the Mac operates much more efficiently than Windows code.

**Unless you've used AutoCAD for a while on the PC already, you'll probably need to buy a third-party book if you need instruction on how to use it.  I was stunned to receive the lowly DVD case with one DVD, and no documentation.  Yes, I know, who includes printed docs anymore, but you would expect for the price that there would be some type of getting started doc that would be user-friendly to newbies.  A good book on using AutoCAD will cost you another couple of hundred bucks which, for some, may add insult to injury.

**Another insult is this version is subscription based, and comes with a one-year subscription. I don't know what the annual subscription will be after that, but I suppose somewhere in the middle of the night 12 months from now, my Mac version will quietly expire, and I'll need to reach for the Amex to bring it back to life.

**The Mac version can only be installed on two Macs, and those two Macs cannot run the program simultaneously. This means, you can run AutoCAD on your desktop MAC at the office, and on your MacBook Pro (you really don't want to run this on anything less than that) and you can share files between the two.  But, you can't be using it at home on the laptop while a colleague is using it at the office.

**Expensive.  Yes, it's a high price tag, but there's really no valid equivalent to this software on the market.  It's not a consumer product, and not even a pro-sumer product, so it's priced for the professional who is doing mid-to-high level design for architecture and product prototyping.

All that said, it's an elegant transformation of an industry warhorse, and will surely not disappoint the most demanding user.",It's about time this was available for the Mac!!,1320278400,,

Pros:
1. The toolbars are better integrated into the workspace.
2. The graphics look a lot better.
3. File sizes are smaller in the new native format.

Problems:
1. Resizing a window is incredibly slow and takes 100% of the available computer power. It feels like you're using a computer from years ago.
edit: much better now, but still slower

2. The first launch of an office program after a restart takes a very, very long time - at least twice as long as a Office 2004 program.

3. You can't edit equations from the Windows document format of Office 2007.

4. Any equations you make in Microsoft Word print fuzzy unless you reopen each one prior to printing. For a long document, this process sometimes takes me about 10 minutes just to print a document I created years ago and resaved in the new format.

5. Excel crashes about twice per day, even when working on new documents with just a few cells.
**edit: this is fixed

6. Documents created in the new native format take much, much, much longer to open than the exact same documents in the old format.
** edit: better, but still true.

7. Compared to Office 2008, Office 2004 is amazingly fast and is much more stable.
** edit: Office 2004 is still better, but not by much

8. The overall program is buggy. Things like adjusting or removing tabs don't work correctly - generally, it only registers something after a long delay.

9. Every document I create double-spaces between paragraphs. I can turn this feature off for a given document, but I can't save a default. Every time I save the default document template, it ignores this setting for some reason.

My one warning is that right out of the box, Live Update is not activated.

While there are other good OCR software solutions out there, OmniPage has consistently been considered the best. I was excited about the opportunity to work with it any while it is good software I found it to be a little ornery and quirky on occasion.

Installation was not smooth on my system. When I inserted the DVD, the installer promptly updated several support application layers such as .NET 4.0 and Microsoft's XML services layer. It was nice to see all of these things installing sequentially, but I was given no option at all about whether or not I wanted them installed, even though some of these were already installed on my system. Once it reached the actual installation for OmniPage itself, though, the installer completely hung. I was unable to eject the DVD and I finally was forced to do a hard shutdown and power-on just to get my system usable again, after which the installer allowed OmniPage to install without argument. I am not sure what happened that caused the installer hang and I was unable to reproduce it.

I launched OmniPage without an active internet connection and during the start-up it asked to be activated via the internet. Also, 4 browser windows opened.

Once through the start-up OmniPage was ready to work. I selected a PDF file for processing and was given several options for translation so I selected MS Word format and let it go. It took quite a bit of time to process, and it prompted me frequently on spelling suggestions (this PDF was a laptop disassembly manual so it flagged multiple technical terms and abbreviations - my fault). I rejected all changes and let it finish. While it worked I was able to change the view to get a workflow view as well as an overview of the resulting document. The multiple views provided an interesting look at various states of my document.

Once the corrections were all through it offered to save the document and I selected a name and saved it, and the result was an empty file. I suspect the problem was that it opened the file for writing but really was not done with the conversion when the output file was created. This is a good thing to keep in mind - patience is required while conversion is running.

The software came with no printed manuals at all, just the DVD.

OmniPage is powerful software and it's really straightforward to use. It has some good features and it simplifies the process of translating image files to text. I found it to be a little temperamental though, and not without fault.","Powerful and easy to use, but also temperamental",1311984000,10,

Thankfully I had the foresight to save a backup file and loaded it onto my laptop computer with Quicken 2012 installed. I read the negative reviews extensively, but I just could not believe they were accurate or true. It was the one and only reason I bought this 2015 version. I was perfectly happy with the 2012 version. I despise their marketing strategy of disabling the ability to download transactions from your various bank accounts after 3 years. It doesn't cost them one penny to allow indefinite downloads.  It is like we have to rent Quicken on a three year contract.  Or else, it will stop performing certain key features if we don't upgrade. I have just recently started to hate Intuit.  I think they must have some new greedy management that gets huge incentives to cheat their customer base.

I didn't realize how bad the Quicken 2015 version was until today when I looked back a couple of years and saw insane numbers.  For instance, it showed over $30,000 in cash and then a few months later, it was negative by $19,000.  This is my pocket money account. I would never have this much cash with me at home or anywhere else.  I finally found the problem. In some accounts, it was sorted by category instead of by date.  I never touch the headings, so this is something that Quicken 2015 did during the import from my 2012 backup.  I was totally panicked until I found the source of the problem.  I nearly uninstalled it to go back to Quicken 2012.

I have been a loyal customer since about 1990 or about that timeframe.  I've had random issues with stock purchases for years.  I've had to do the calculations by hand or Excel to be more exact because I could never trust Quicken to make the profit or loss calculations correctly and I don't understand why, either.  It's simple arithmetic.

If you are upgrading from a prior version and have extensive data files dating into antiquity, I suggest you try to control yourself and keep your credit card in your wallet where it should remain indefinitely.  Don't be tempted or intimidated into buying this version.  The 2012 version of Quicken is just fine - but I am not confident with this one.  Also, every time I opened my Quicken file with this version, the loading time was far longer than in Quicken 2012. I've got a really fast computer running at 4.6 GHz and it takes 8 seconds to load.  It's not such a long time, but Quicken 2012 was near instant with the very same file.

I've been a Quicken defender and advocate of this product for 25 years and now my faith and confidence are destroyed.  I will not upgrade again. I will have to record things from the internet by hand because Quicken is being a total jerk by disallowing me to continue doing that after April 2015. It's totally arbitrary. They must have some new jerk in marketing who is trying to gouge its customer base to coerce customers to upgrade every three years.  That is being totally idiotic.

While keeping the lower cost, PaintShop Pro has been steadily moving toward the full capability of Photoshop. The last couple upgrades, however, seem more like a nod to the nifty automatic tools rather than catching up on the last few things Photoshop does better. X7 is not, in my opinion, worth upgrading from X6. If you're new to image editing, definitely look at Corel PaintShop, but I would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Ultimate version -- the extra tools and textures are worth it.

The learning curve will be fairly steep if this is your first time entering this sort of image editing, but if you poke through the automatic and ""magic"" tools you will find yourself able to make some quite impressive things happen to your photos easily. The ""Adjust"" window (of the top tabs: Manage - Adjust - Edit) is your friend for most photo alterations, as you can see a preview of what the tool does.

When I switched to Mac, I started using Adobe Illustrator. CorelDRAW has always been the ONLY comparable product to Illustrator, and continues to be so with Suite X8. It's exclusively a Windows program, so if that's the environment you're working in, and you're looking to upgrade to a real graphics program, Suite X8 would be a great choice.

As with Illustrator, the learning curve is steep. This isn't one of those watered down vector art programs, this is the real deal, meant to give you powerful tools to create a variety of deliverables in unlimited formats. I won't waste space here listing the modules and what they do, since that's available in the above product description from Corel.  What I will make note of is the inclusion of AfterShot 2 as a built-in module that is exclusive with this release via Amazon.  AfterShot 2 gives you the same kind of photo editing power that you'll find in Photoshop, and most notably adds the ability to edit RAW files from nearly every known camera on the planet that will shoot in the RAW format.  If you don't know what RAW is, then you'll probably never use this feature, but for those who do, it's nice to know Corel has finally added the support for RAW images that have long been available in Illustrator.

THE PROS
*If you're already a CorelDRAW user, Suite X8 is a worthy upgrade.  Most of the user interface is identical, with a few enhancements, so you'll know your way around.  There's a free 30-day tutorial available online to get you up to speed on the new features and functions.
*This is a one-person license, but it's a permanent license with no other fees required.  Corel also has a subscription service if you want to ""rent"" CorelDRAW, similar to Adobe's Creative Cloud, if you don't want to pay the full retail price up front.  The subscription also includes free updates.
*CorelDraw will export and import native Adobe Illustrator files if you're moving from that platform, or also use Illustrator files, and prefer to continue to work in CorelDraw.
*As a vector creator/editor, CorelDRAW can match Illustrator feature-for-feature, even though it may do things differently than Illustrator, you can get the same things done. It really comes down to a matter of preference.

THE CONS
*You have to have an internet connection to activate the software, and to allow them to check your license at least once a month.  Not usually a problem since if you're reading this, you have internet access, but I find it a bit intrusive.  Just a small detail.
*While CorelDRAW is an outstanding vector art program, I find Photopaint to be an inferior cousin to Photoshop, and the website creator should be avoided altogether. Corel is trying to provide a ""value-added"" incentive by adding these other programs in a ""suite"" but I wouldn't buy CorelDRAW for its photo-editing capabilities.
*This is ONLY a Windows program. I've always wanted Corel to port DRAW over to the Mac.  If they had, I would still be using it and probably never have started with Illustrator, which then eventually drew me in to all of the related Adobe products.  That said, CorelDRAW does offer a robust export/import function to use files from other programs, but it's not as seamless as with Illustrator.

Just a reminder: This is NOT a program for newbies.  Even though Corel and everyone else touts the ease of use of their programs, there's a steep learning curve to programs like CorelDRAW and Illustrator when you reach this level of professional program.  But, don't be discouraged if you are new to this level.  You CAN learn the program, just give yourself time.

This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.

The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements
* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.

Software companies often do the same thing.  In this case the most stripped down version is known as ""Deluxe"".  ""Deluxe"" is defined to mean ""luxurious or sumptuous; of a superior kind"" and yet that's the exact opposite of what you get when you buy the ""Deluxe"" product (just like when you buy a ""large"" pizza, you are really getting the exact opposite--a small pizza).

<pauses for a breath... trying to find a happy place... sigh...>

As for the software itself, I have used PowerDirector 12 for a while now and have appreciated it's user interface and feature set.  A year or two ago, I was working on what appeared to be a very simple project--I imported a movie I had gotten online (legally downloaded, I'll have you know) and was trying to edit it for time so a co-worker could use it in a presentation.  The effects were all very simple: fade in/fade out, etc. but even though I spent a couple of hours with various video editing programs, I could not get it to work for me.  As I recall, Adobe Premier Pro CS5 couldn't understand the input file format so first I converted it with an AVS4You program.  Then I had it all edited the way I wanted, but Premier had a zillion and fifty output format settings and I couldn't seem to find the magical combination that would work on my co-worker's Mac and still be a reasonable size (either the file was HUGE, the quality was TERRIBLE, or it just wouldn't work on the Mac).  Next I switched to Pinnacle Studio 14, but it had issues, too--I don't remember what they were, but it was obvious that Pinnacle was a no-go.  Finally I tried PowerDirector.  It was more or less the first time I had used the program, and yet in under an hour, I had a fully rendered video that was a good quality, reasonable file size AND it played on my Windows PC and my co-worker's Mac.

As a side note, I'm pretty sure that Premier Pro can do all the things I've used PowerDirector for, but the darn program has such a learning curve that I often spend a good deal of time just trying to figure out how to do something as simple as fading from one clip to another.  Oh, sure--once you know how to do it, it's easy and once you have been working with the program for a long time, you'll probably find features much faster, but for a novice like myself, it's usually just a frustration.  PowerDirector, on the other hand, has an interface that to me is very intuitive.

You can go to Cyberlink's web site to view all the new features in 13 from 12, but in my opinion, the most noteworthy change is the addition of 2 new formats, XAVC-S and H.265/HEVC.  As noted previously, I'm no video editing expert and I don't use these programs often, but from what I can tell, the look and feel has not changed in any significant way.

If you are reading reviews trying to figure out which video editing program you want to get, I would highly recommend one of the flavors of PowerDirector.  Just go to the web site first so you know what it is you are getting (and what you are not) with the version you pick--the name sure as heck ain't gonna' tell ya!","PowerDirector 13, level 2 is an easy to use, full featured video editor",1417564800,,

No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

One of the main factors in getting me to make the jump was a piece of software called Parallels, which allowed me to run my Windows applications at native speed alongside my Mac apps.  The techie term for this is ""virtualization,"" essentially a ""computer within a computer.""

Mac users are very fortunate to now have two outstanding commercial options for virtualization:  the venerable Parallels Desktop, and the upstart VMWare Fusion.  Although I have been a loyal Parallels customer since its initial release, I must concede that VMWare Fusion 2 currently has the edge.

VMWare as a company is, of course, far from being the rookie in the virtualization market.  On the PC side of the fence, VMWare has dominated  for years with a very mature virtualization engine that runs on a variety of platforms.  That experience is clearly reflected in their Fusion product.

VMWare Fusion 2 is mature, fast, and a vast improvement over Parallels Desktop.  Fusion feels more 'Mac-like,' offers easier printing options, and is noticeably faster on both my Mac Pro and Macbook Pro.  It works with existing Boot Camp partitions as well as a self contained 'virtual machine' that stores itself as a single file on your hard disk.  Virtual machines from Parallels Desktop can be converted to VMWare format.

While the bells and whistles are nice, two things for me sets VMWare Fusion apart from Parallels:

1.  Overhead.  While Parallels has almost a constant 20% idle rate drain on my CPU, VMWare is practically at zero when idle.  Memory usage is more efficient too.  This is significant, especially if you're running Windows programs alongside Mac apps on a notebook where memory and CPU are often at a premium.  When it does need some horsepower, VMWare supports multiple processor cores - something the current version of Parallels doesn't.

2.  Appliances.  VMWare has a very active ""appliance"" community that continually adds value to the product.  Appliances are pre-configured virtual machines that run everything from open-source servers to full Linux distributions.  They are a great way to experiment with some of the great open source software projects without having to go through the aggravation of installation and configuration.  Just download the appliance and boot it up with VMWare Fusion.  In fairness, Parallels does have its own appliance community, but it is nowhere near as robust as VMWare's community.

CONCLUSION

Mac users looking to run Windows and Linux have a great choice between two very capable virtualization apps.  The edge right now almost definitely goes to VMWare.  It not only sports a more intuitive interface, it also requires far less overhead and has an outstanding community behind it.

I have no doubt the upcoming release of Parallels Desktop 4.0 will bring both competitors back on equal footing.  But for now, VMWare Fusion 2 is the superior virtualization application for Mac users.",Excellent Virtualization Software,1225065600,4,

Invest time up front getting all of your accounts set up correctly.  Trying to fix things later will be a HUGE waste of time.  The time up front will be a bargain.

Imagine taking a phone order for a big job and just clicking one package to invoice, purchase and create a workorder to get all of the paperwork done.

I have also used TurboTax for several years and except for the fact that it costs more, I like it too.  Turbotax used to be able to download Schedule D data from many brokerages, but they discontinued that feature, so I saw no advantage in paying more.  Taxcut never had that feature, but if you have to do Schedule D from scratch in both cases there is no reason to pay more.  Taxcut imports last year's return data from Taxcut or Turbotax and marks it for editing.  It will also import Quicken data, but I don't have high confidence in my own data being correctly assigned to the appropriate tax categories, so I bypassed that step, but I did print out a Quicken Tax Schedule to refer to.  I noticed only one software error and that is when doing a new W4 form for Estimated Payments for 2008, it kept inserting my last year's wages even though I stated I would have no wages in the interview step.

Bitdefender is another in a long line of programs that get the job done, but simply aren't worth the extra money after the end of 2009. First, let me make it clear that Bitdefender does everything they claim it will do. It does an excellent job identifying and isolating risks to your PC. In that sense, Bitdefender is great and worth buying.

Unfortunately for Bitdefender, Microsoft finally figured out that they need to do something about Windows security. Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is now available for free download from the Microsoft website and is better than Bitdefender in a number of ways:

1) MSE is free.
2) MSE doesn't hog PC resources ... so your computer doesn't slow down because of the anti-virus software.
3) MSE is easier to manage because it integrates well with Windows.

Bitdefender identified all of the test viruses and adware I intentionally tried to expose my PC to, but why pay money for software if there is something else that does essentially the same thing for free? One advantage that Bitdefender has over MSE is that Bitdefender runs a full system scan faster than MSE, but Bitdefender also consumes more system resources ... so your computer slows down when Bitdefender is running a full scan.

Bottom line, there's nothing wrong with this software but I just can't recommend it now that Microsoft Security Essentials is available.",An OK anti-virus/anti-spyware program ... but not worth the money,1260921600,4,

Nancy is invited to Blackmoor Manor in merry old England to check on the new wife of a British diplomat. The woman has apparently become sick shortly after her new marriage. Rumors abound that the Beast of Blackmoor is creeping around, along with a family witch.

Suspects include Linda's stepdaughter Jane Penvellyn, scholar Nigel Mookerjee, batty old Mrs. Drake, and Jane's tutor Ethel Bosinny.

The villain and the Penvellyn treasure were both RIDICULOUS. All that threatening atmosphere and chilling spookiness wasted on such silly things.

Puzzles: C

Argh! Just aargh! So many of them! And so tedious they were! The premise is that the Penvellyn family has a long and illustrious history of being geniuses of one kind or another. Each member of the family studied a certain subject, such as computers or astronomy. And they all left clues for future generations to a great hidden treasure (there it is again). The clues are all crazily scattered all over the manor, hidden in Latin crests and books and alchemical symbols.

You also have to talk to an 80-year-old parrot to solve one puzzle. The family trusted a huge and important secret partly to a parrot that could keel over at any moment. (Yes, they live a long time, but not every parrot lives so long.)

Other silly details include a revolving room and a strange map that somehow tracks your progress through an area, even though GPS wasn't invented way back when.

They could have left out the anacronistic map, sure, but then we would have been in serious trouble. The gamers needed all the help they could get in this game. The puzles just kept going and going. The game was long and involved.

Gameplay: C

Nancy is supposedly in England and we aren't allowed to see a single bit of the English countryside. Why? Because Mrs. Drake doesn't want us tracking mud through the house. If I came a thousand miles to another country, nobody would stop me from taking a look outside! This game didn't even have to be set in England. It could have taken place in Salem, Mass. just as easily. (Of course, the Penvellyn family wouldn't have been as old then.)

I couldn't trigger some events in the game no matter how carefully I played or what walkthrough I followed. I ended up downloading saved games from other people to get past these parts of the game. It lessened the quality of the gameplay for me, to say the least.

One thing I loved were Jane's mini-games. Sometimes I open the game just to play Skull and Bones.

Time Changes: The alarm clock is back. Argh!

Voice Acting: B

Jane is a cute, cultured little English girl. Ethel got on my nerves, appearing out of nowhere and looking down her nose at me. Linda irritated me, her voice and character. I mean, I realize you're depressed, but I flew a thousand miles to help you, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just answer my questions instead of clamming up, okay, lady?

The cockney rhyming slang was extra cool, though.

Music: A

Very restrained and classical. Chilling and spooky when it needed to be.

IGraphics/Video: A

Jane in particular was weirdly animated. All joints and long legs. I think she was too thin.

Other than that, the graphics were the best yet. Bonus points for the smooth animated sequences in between player-controlled action.

Technical: C

Along with the problem I had triggering events, I had another glitch in the game. When ordering food from the restaurant, it would appear on a silver platter in my room. But, after that, I could never get other food to be delivered, no matter how long I waited or how many times I asked for it. Every time I lifted the lid, it would always be the first thing I had ordered.

Antiphishing
Rootkit detection
Identity protection
Web site authentication

Automatic backup and restore
2GB secured online storage

One aspect that I noticed is its no longer a system hog like it used to be.  It even scans, defragments and mantains your system while your computer is idle.

However, if your machine is no longer in the ""new, fresh"" state, get ready to face some problems.  It seems like it complicates things with other utility programs that may have already be installed on your machine(thats why I said ""Big Ego."")

I had problems with Norton 360 when I installed it on a PC that was reformatted half a year ago and it didn't run too well: freezing, hang-ups and Live Update complete stopped working.  It was also difficult to uninstall.

However, on a newly bought PC it worked pretty smoothly so far with no complications.

But don't take my word for it.  PC Magazine has an extensive review on it.  EDIT:  Amazon took the link off...I guess we're not allowed to post 3rd party links.  However, if you google ""Norton 360 review"" it will be one of the top links.",Ideal for new computers only!,1212883200,11,

There are lots of cards to choose from.  For the most part its easy to tweak the cards the way you want them, after you get used to using the program.  Honestly, its not super user friendly, but again, once you get used to it, its not a big deal.  You can print them as half-fold, or 4X6.

And even did the same thing but with better effects with the Video Toaster. By the file I could even think of affording a Video Toaster Flyer, I already went PC and then waited for affordable editing to come for it. I started with Pinnacle Studio and eventually moved on to Adobe but Corel Video Studio has been a very interesting alternative.

I use a Core i7 5th generation tower PC to capture video from VHS / 8MM tape and I do most of my editing on a Surface Book Core i7, 6th generation. But rest assured, I also use a lot of today's modern digital video from phones to cameras.

Corel VideoStudio installs like a champ and is up and ready to go in no time. Surprisingly, I find it's interface much easier to use than Adobe Premiere Elements as it is more straight forward. I was up, running and editing in no time.

One of my favorite features is Instant Movies and FastFlick. These days, I want to slap together a quick video for fast sharing and this is a great feature. Not as convenient as the ""Assistant"" on Google Photos but does the same and better job.

I recently added to my family and wanted to get a decent software package to record my little-ones and our vacation.  I was pretty hesitant about going back to PSP, but I really am glad that I did.

You really don't have to have much experience with photo editing with PSP--it will walk you through your task and yet let you customize your project so that it doesn't end up looking like a corny photo Christmas card from Walgreens.

The differences from the version I had years ago against todays version (X6) is profound to say the least.  You can load HUGE files on your system without any freezing, also, the interface is really simplified without dumbing it down for a newbie user that would limit someone with some experience in photo editing.  And by the way, if you are a newbie, this is a GREAT program to start with anyways--you'll be a pro in no time, and, average users may consider their career options towards graphics.

There are so many incredible features to this version, I would have to write several pages on the features/benefits themselves.  But, here's a few diamonds:

-Faster HDR Rendering
-FASTER preformance
-All new and VERY helpful video tutorials
-Auto-fix tools
-Adds any type of effect you can imagine
-Retouches photos to remove red-eyes and even wrinkles (I look 10 years younger:)

And those above are just a few great enhances that Corel has made to the PSP 6X version.

Just as I was beginning to get reasonably comfortable with its features, I found VideoStudio Pro 8 and X8 Ultimate.

Ultimate X8 has all the features of Pro 8 and all the benefits Ive come to expect from Corel, but for only a few more dollars, Ultimate X8 has 10 add-ons that are well worth considering before you make a purchase decision.

I have several favorites among the 10 add-ons, especially Audio ducking.  Now I can use background music without drowning out voice-over effects.  Also, I like the titling add-on where I can make transparent titles for very interesting effects.

Corel provides tutorials for each of their add-ons in Ultimate X8.  I have not finished viewing or practicing all of them, but, based on the tutorials I have used, I deem their quality outstanding.  I will eventually see all of them because there will be features pointed out that I was unaware existed.

Fun to use with excellent tutorials to make you look like an expert!  I cant ask for more than VideoStudio Ultimate X8.  And the price won't break your budget  most reasonable for all thats packed into this package.

I upgraded to WinZip when it was owned by Nico Mak Computing and released in the early 1990s as a GUI front-end for PKZIP. Then Corel bought WinZip in 2006.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-17-Standard/dp/B009RG41HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 17 Standard</a>&nbsp;is a full-featured product, with a lot of good functionality. It does an excellent job opening and extracting ZIP, Zipx, 7Z, LHA/LZH, RAR, BZ2 and about all of the other major compression file formats of which you can think. It makes fast work of converting Microsoft Word docs (and other Office files) to PDF format, and it's easy to create them as read-only PDF if you want to avoid file alteration by other parties.

If you have a large number of digital photos on your hard drive, it will reduce your .JPG images by about 20 to 25% with no loss of photo quality or data integrity. Photographers with a large number of images should note that WinZip may (or may not) cause some issues with image management/viewing applications such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Nikon ViewNX 2, so run some tests before you try to compress all of your images. I have not tried compressing RAW images, as keeping them intact is a personal thing.

Where this software really shines is its ability to take full advantage of your cloud storage by zipping files before you post them to online file sharing services like Google Drive, Dropbox and SkyDrive. You can protect your files and organize them this way, and select files from the cloud to zip and share. The software allows you to share files to Facebook and other social networking sites using the online ZipShare, though I've only tried a very limited amount of sharing this way. Some may find this to be very handy.

I was one of those who had bought a ""lifetime"" WinZip license from Nico Mak, where registered users could download the newest versions of the software, enter their original registration info, and install free upgrades on top of the existing registered version. This worked out very well, but when Corel bought WinZip in 2006, was told that I had bought it from ""the old company"" and my lifetime license was no good. After a number of emails back and forth, I got tired of the debate, removed the software and switched to the 7-Zip open source file archive utility, which worked fine. Now I'm back to WinZip 17, but with a mild amount of caution to see how they handle future upgrades.

10844,3,False,"09 26, 2015",A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B01019TDJ8,,NeuroSplicer,"It was only last year that I was forced to abandon my trusted WinXP and upgrade to Win7. And I say forced because Microsoft made sure that key features of my OS was not working anymore, including its security. So, Win7 was a brief yet not a bad altogether experience - if one disregards numerous lack of customization options and the palpable effort of Microsoft to make us abandon them yet again, that is. Such as stopping our desktop widgets from working in order to promote the ""brilliant"" Win8 tiles! Nevertheless, what I want to make clear is that I am comparing Win10 to an extensive background on WinXP and an adequate experience with Win7.

ALL YOUR BASES ARE BELONG TO US
Two words: forced updates. I was lucky enough to have opted for the Professional edition of the Win7, so when I got to switch to Win10, I received the Professional edition as well - which comes with the option to defer (yet still not pick between or even cancel) the installation of the latest updates. Currently, I am trying to ignore the Action Center notification for an nVidia update, that keeps pestering me to install it since las week. The Home edition, however, does not give the user any such option and all updates are forced onto him. Remember how after numerous ""essential"" updates in the past, our PCs encountered a myriad or mysterious problems that were never solved before the next update, months later? Yeah, there is no more avoiding these problems anymore.

A PRIVACY NIGHTMARE
From the initial Logging in only with a Microsoft-confirmed eMail account to the Groove Music and the Movies & TV Players amassing info on your files and personal habits, including the content of our eMails which MS ""reserves the right"" to pass on (read: sell) to unnamed third parties(!). There is no avoiding it: Win10 are a private person's worst nightmare. In a sense, Win10 are the basis of the most intrusive and abusive DRM ever to be slipped in in our computers, coupled with the most blatant disregard for a person's privacy at home. There had been an uproar even since the pre-release builds and some deactivation options are now available - but they are far from thorough and very prone to turning back on by themselves after a while. And it now begs the question: how much can one trust a company that silently downloaded Win10 to every WinVISTA, Win7 and Win8 PC without the consent of their owners?

NO, IT IS NOT FASTER BY ANY MEANS!
Microsoft did not allow us to perform a clean install when upgrading from a previous Microsoft OS; however, using one's product Serial Number, it was possible to download the official image and burn it onto a disk (or transfer it to an empty USB). In preparation for the upgrade, I increased my system's RAM to 12GM and a few days after the initial update, I formated and did a clean install. Then I went on installing only software that was Win10 compatible. Keep this information in mind when I tell you that Win10 are SLOW. Slower than Win7 and much, much slower than WinXP! It takes forever to transfer files to and from a USB flash drive (a problem that started with Win7, supposedly to prevent data loss when removing drives insecurely, yet still with no option to toggle it on and off). What is more aggravating, it takes forever to explore folders, especially those on my second HDD, even if they were opened just a few moments ago.
So, why is it not faster? Is it because of an increase in cosmetic additions and aesthetic customizations? No. Absolutely no. Kindly read on.

ESSENTIAL CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS ARE MISSING
The Windows interface and Menu options look worse than Win7. Aero Glass, for some unfathomable reason, is not available. The Windows borders are not customizable (for the first time since Win95!). Quick Launch can be made to appear with some Registry editing (I would advise Googling it - carefully!) yet the icons in this DIY Quick Launch now cannot be centered in the Toolbar and they stay misaligned to the Task View button; the option of which icons and how to appear in the Taskbar is missing; whereas, this latest shinny OS refuses to learn that I do not like every shortcut to have a ""Shortcut to"" prefix to every shortcut I create - something Win98 had no problem learning after the third time I removed it on a new one.
There is a semi-official piece of software (no, I am not calling them Apps!) called Windows Ultimate Tweaker 4: I would recommend it as it does offer a number of options, some of which are very useful. However, one of the most important ones (specifically: which new file-templates and options to appear when right-clicking on the desktop) -you guessed it!- is missing.
And do not get me started on the Start Menu!

WHY MESS WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKED FINE?
Win8 were a complete failure mainly because of their Start menu. We all loved the WinXP Start Menu, easy to use, a breeze to customize and backup when needed. Win7 improved on it, even if, quite counter-intuitively, one had to use libraries in order to add personal folders in the Start Menu. Yet, everything was at the right place. Well, not so much with Win10.
The Power button now looks like any other and is to be found between(!) All-Apps and Settings - and when pressed (remember that this will also be needed to be done at 2:00AM after 12 hours of working on a screen) one has to read and carefully select between the Shut Down or Restart options that appear. Every single time. With no confirmation dialog.
The installed software (All-Apps) are alphabetized easy to navigate - yet its folders do not respond to Right-clicking them. They are just dead.
The Tiles Panel, however, this is where they screwed up again: none of the tiles are customizable in other aspects than total size (resulting in beautiful icons looking ridiculous in all that empty background). Why can we not readjust the sizes of the contained icons? And yet they even failed to adjust the tile sizes correctly!
The Tiles Panel allows resizing but only in huge pre-set steps. We can also move and group the tiles. Some (but not all) tiles come in 4 sizes, others in 3 yet most in only 2 sizes. The step-wise increments of the Tile Panel create space for 6 small tiles in each group. (if you are asking why, I shall tell you why: because 5' screen Windows Phones can show 6-tiles, that's why!). Have less than 6 tiles in a group and the empty space is an ugly waste. Moreover, no tile under them can grow to fill the space under 6 small tiles, so, once again, more ugly wasted space.
Oh, and for some another mysterious reason, not all installed software can be pinned to the Tile Panel, even if they do appear in the All-Apps list! You have to hunt for them in your Program Files and find the executable.

COMPATIBILITY MODE IS STILL A JOKE
Drakensang: The Dark Eye is not an old game, barely 5-6 years old and it is supposed to be Win10 compatible. At least its expansion is, and that run fine. The original game, however, refused to run under any ""compatibility mode"". Does this thing finally do anything besides reducing the resolution, Microsoft? You know, like trying running a few years old software under DirectX 9.0c or something?

ALL KNOWN BUGS ARE STILL THERE
The Recycle Bin still refuses to use its customized icons, just like with Win7. The Explorer folders are still unable to retain my Viewing preferences. And the Desktop still ...looses files (especially saved web-pages) one then has to hunt down with the Explorer (even if they are still in the Desktop folder).

Overall, not a failure of WinVISTA or Win8 proportions but nowhere near as good as WinXP - or even Win7 for that matter.

I am willing to accept this as a work in progress and give them 6 months to get their act together and patch things up.
Yet they should not think that they will get a free ride just because they claim to be giving it away for ""free"". Because it was not.
We had to exchange our perfectly working OS for it.

Altogether it took about 20 minutes, it was a seamless process.  If you know that you want to install on several computers / laptops all at once you're good to go.  If not, you do have an option for later installation:  ""You can always install Sage 50 on additional computers later.""  I was simply installing in on my PC, so opted for the one for now.

One other thing you'll need to consider during installation is disabling your firewall.  I chose to allow my Windows Firewall to work with Sage, but I could also have configured it manually.  There are a few things to consider when installing, but I found it to be an easy step-by-step process with no problems.  I simply closed out everything in the background and concentrated on the installation process.

Sage 50 is perfect for the individual accountant or small business bookkeeper.  Customer support has been spotty in the past and that has been their biggest downfall.  This packet comes with a full year of customer support and online updates.  What I'm seeing and want to see, is easy access for when I need help.  There's online assistance where I can ""manage a case"" by shooting off an email or can access technical support via chat.  Personally I much prefer using phone support when I have issues (866-747-3888).  The proof is in the pudding as they say and if anyone is having issues, later reviews will probably let everyone know how customer support is doing.

Learning curves are sometimes what the individual makes of them.  I'm so far liking what I see.  I was able to take a look at a sample company and could easily spot a section ""Getting Around Sage 50.""  If I can't see anything right in a program or if I have to buy an expansive book I easily become frustrated and will turn away.  Sage has everything right where I want it ... at my fingertips right in the program.  More than likely, the lengthy installation had something to do with this.  I don't want to buy a ""secrets"" sort of book nor do I want to go scouting around on the net to find out something.

I was looking at ""Show-Me-How Videos,"" ""Quick Reference Guides,"" and a list of ""Sage University Courses.""  No further expenditure was needed on my part.  I didn't have to take a pill so to speak from getting a headache looking at a mess.  Everything was laid out nicely and wasn't overwhelming.  Many of the learning areas had drop down menus with additional areas to explore.  I'm going to list what I saw as an easy-access learning menu below.

Do I think I can easily manage and work with this accounting software?  Yes.  Am I confident the company will come through with that customer support that was lacking in the past?  I'm not sure, but that remains to be seen and can't be predicted without more people weighing in.

Gone is the 2014 disaster - which was awkwardly corrected by Intuit - where they removed functionality yet called the product ""Deluxe"".  Intuit did listen to all of us who complained and has now kept the product version names consistent.  (If you missed my review last year of the 2014 product, take a look here: http://www.amazon.com/review/ROS6R0SV2H27M/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYXTCGY&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=229534&store=software )

Previous year's return imported just fine, and the interview and forms process is as prior years, simple to follow and thorough.  I did try H&R Block last year when Intuit made a mess of the 2014 Deluxe version - and wrote up an entire page of things that H&R Block did wrong or completely missed compared to TurboTax.  I would never consider H&R Block for a slightly complicated return based on that experience, however the TuroTax interview process guides you through all kinds of situations with ease.

I bumped a star because of Intuit's greed with the pricing of this product which does NOT include a state return.  I just paid $39.99 via an in-product purchase to add my state ... yet the Federal & State product costs only $10 more - not $40.  Total rip off.  Do note that I received this Federal product free via the Amazon Vine program for review and had I purchased, I would have bought the Federal + State which is my typical product.  But, I can imagine folks accidentally picking up this box (or download) and then having to purchase their state add-on at Intuit's rip-off price.

The pushpins have been updated to include many more symbols to choose from.

The ""Measure Distance"" tool allows you to trace along routes with instant feedback so you may find out if it really is ""shorter to go that way.""

Planned routes can be searched for places or points of interests along the way within specified distances, and MapPoint will display an easy-to-follow proximity-highlighted readout of the results complete with extended information. You can easily expand or contract the distance criterea as well.

Under the Map Settings tab, you can selectively add or remove symbols, labels or both from various types of featured map points making custom views extremely simple.

There are so many possibilites with MapPoint 2010, and it is a much more powerful program than Streets and Trips. Powerful Data Mapping features allow you to do business-related analysis visually.

The program lets you choose either the ""easy"" or ""full-featured"" editing mode when it loads, and after going through the basic features you can then switch to advanced for additional editing, so you aren't just dropped into a sea of options you won't know how to navigate.

The only problem I have with the basic editing toolset is that it appears to force you to put a theme on your video, such as slow motion or having your clip appear in a rotating mobile above a baby's crib. I couldn't seem to find a way to just add music and change the file type in the basic toolset without first adding an unnecessary theme (although these things are easily done in advanced mode). The amount of options available is pretty staggering, and much of it is automatic and doesn't require specialized knowledge on the user's part. There are auto-correction features for fixing poor lighting, shaky camera, etc. along with controls to manually adjust the color and brightness levels both across the whole video clip or just individual frames.

Before producing a finished video the software lets you change the aspect ratio and do advanced editing by adding things like particle effects or a large array of pre-made themes. For something simpler, there's also the option to create slideshows from individual frames or photos. There are of course also tools for breaking your video down into chapters like in a normal movie before burning to a DVD. Frankly there are more options than you'll likely be able to figure out on your own unless you happen to be well versed in this type of software, and thankfully there's a large book-style manual included that goes over everything.

While you probably won't be editing together ""The Return of the King"" anytime soon with Power Director, it definitely puts more power and options at your fingertips than with the usual suspects like Windows Movie Maker. Power Director does require lots of processing power however, so make sure you exceed the minimum system requirements before buying.

I've been using it now as my primary e-mail client for about three months. So far, so good.

I had little to no problems installing Outlook 2007. I'm using XP, and my Office suite is 2000. I like the GUI, but not all documents (especially Word and HTML docs) render as they do in their native apps, and I'm assuming this is because my other Office apps are getting way old.

Also, I appreciate that Outlook 2007 lets you add RSS feeds. I subscribe to many newsletter and blog reports and find this feature useful. I've had no problems with just the e-mail reading/organizing capabilities; everything there works just fine.

Like many people writing reviews here, I'm disappointed that Outlook 2007 with BCM is so slow. I used to use Outlook Express as my e-mail client, which is pretty fast compared to Outlook 2007, so maybe it's just a matter of getting used to the new app.

I was hoping this app would allow me to do more with billing and invoicing, but I've read a few blogs and discovered to get Business Contact Manager to really do all it can do (which is probably a lot), you'll need Microsoft Accounting installed, too. I'm considering buying that app, but I wish I didn't have to.

The full functionality of the app is a bit beyond me at this point (again, I'm upgrading from Outlook Express, so the learning curve is no surprise), but I hope this changes with time. Right now, I find myself using the same three or four functions all the time, which is normal. It's how I generally use the other apps in the Office group.

I've found myself in the past criticizing certain aspects of other Microsoft products (Word in particular), only to find out later these apps had the ability to do what I wanted them to do all along, but I just didn't know it.

I was even offered a free one-year license for three PCs, but instead chose to sign up with Eset again.  Here's why.

I have occasion to fix PCs from time to time, and part of that is scrubbing hard drives and such.  Kasperksy actually failed to protect my test bench machine from trojan infections on a USB-attached hard drive.  I was greatly disappointed; more so, when I downloaded NOD32 and found existing infections on the Kaspersky-protected machine.  Unacceptable.

However, that could be forgiven in a greater context, as not every AV product catches all infections.  I've used Kaspersky, Alwil, McAfee, Norton/Symantec, AVG, Eset, and Microsoft on many machines, and all have blind spots.  However, with Kaspersky, you're also buying network security, and my primary issue with that is it was too complicated to configure properly.  I never had solid feedback as to the efficacy or even correctness of my configurations, and I have configured iptables in anger, so this was bizarre.  Furthermore, Kaspersky was a major disaster with logon scanning and delays.  It was too painful to use.

In the end, even a price of zero would not allow me to continue with the product.  I went back to Eset, and now I hardly know it's there... and that's exactly what you want from an AV product.

You can then visually see all hospitals of a certain size or how much revenue if any you have sold there so far.  You can then better decide sales territories and such.  Of course, once you did, you can provide your sales force with MapPoint and have it provide them routes to each destination to maximize their time on the road and in front of clients.

It can work at first, but later on can clog your PC and prevent you from loading new software, because of Norton's backing up so much for the computer hard disk drive. While it is a good buy if you are wanting it for the short run, there are other brands do much more in the long run, and save you a lot of money in the process. If you want a antivirus that works in the long run, you are better off getting a lesser-known brand like Bitdefender or Vipre, which they both work just as well and some cases better than the major brand names.

This one keeps the general look and feel of my last version (12), which I appreciate.  WP continues to follow the basic Windows-like menu structure instead of the old function-key approach, and I've long since resigned myself to that.

The suite remains better than MS-Word and related products, though they continue to converge.  I appreciate the ""reveal codes"" feature, which MS seems incapable of duplicating.  Also, I work with lots of foreign languages and with mathematical symbols, and WP supports a bigger menu of those than Word does.

Other reviewers will give you other reasons why WP is better, and I'll say only: believe us.  All of us.  It's better.  For lots of reasons.

If you work with people who use Microsoft Office products -- and who doesn't -- you'll be happy to know that WP imports and exports to Office very well.

I had high hopes that this program would help address the first issue. No such luck. But it's an awesome Paint program.

WRT Photoshop - the program claims Photoshop compatibility, and this is true, inasmuch as it can open .psd files. It even preserves layers. What it doesn't do is bring in anything path- or object-based -- no splines, no fills, no reshaping, no manipulations that aren't bitmap/pixel rendering. If you thought the price for this as a Photoshop replacement was too good to be true, you were right.

WRT Paint - this does everything you ever wanted from that toy. Layers (as mentioned above), a much less useless zoom feature, all sorts of fun brushes and effects (with stylus pressure support), pixel-based transforms, and even a better-designed color mixer. Sweet.

Once I stopped expecting too much from it, the program was a lot of fun to play with, with a few annoyances. First annoyance -- the help function takes you to the help files for Painter itself, not Essentials. So, you will read about this cool feature, and then, at the bottom of the page, be presented with an apologetic ""Some features described in the Help are available only in Corel Painter 2015, and are not included in Painter Essentials 5. For more information about Corel Painter 2015, visit http://www.painterartist.com/""  (which is a store link). Essentials is the teaser for the more expensive program (which does support paths), and Corel makes no attempt to hide this. Second, as with all Corel's graphics programs, this software can only be installed once. Were you planning on changing machines any time soon?  Well, unless the first machine fails catastrophically, you can't take this with you.

Given the relatively low price of this package, I would still recommend it to budding artists and fingerpainting kids of all ages. It's not a professional tool, however, and doesn't really claim to be.

Usually I upgrade my Roxio software when I upgrade Windows and I need the newer version of Roxio to work with the new versions of Windows. I upgraded this time after going to Windows 8.  This doesn't surprise me as CD/DVD software hooks into the storage code of the operating system to do its thing. Change that code (as in a Windows upgrade) and Roxio needs to be updated. In the past, I only cared about the DVD/CD writing capabilities of Roxio. But after seeing the new software included with NXT, I find I'm really using the new programs. These new programs are Videowave (video editing), Convert (captures and converts videos to different formats), Paintshop Pro (photo editing), and Audio capture and conversion. Most of the time, you access these programs from the Roxio menu screen by selecting what you want to do and the menu launches the program you need to do the task.

Some of the new features that I find the most useful include:

Converting video to the best format to transfer to your tablet, phone, or share online.
Capture videos from websites (like Youtube).
Making slideshows from photos (including adding soundtracks) then converting to video format.

If you hit that threshold, your standard Will ends up being a ticket for up to 2 years in probate. You still want a will when you do a living trust as sort of a catch-all, but with that you need the proper power of attorneys set up (note that was plural). The right kind of protection is a legal will, durable power of attorney for finances, directive for health care and caregiver instructions. Plus of course you want a Living Trust as the flag ship. I just learned all this YESTERDAY, while WillMaker was on my desk waiting to be used and reviewed. This version of WillMaker offers everything on the list I just gave, including a free one year subscription to Nolo's Living Trust service. That's huge and a a huge bargain, because a Living Trust is an updatable document that should be reviewed and refined as family situations change, hence the subscription.  The law office gave us their price sheet to set up all of these docs: $2,950, seriously. Considering all that goes into creating a fully protected and executable will and trust and all the rest, that's understandable for a local law office. But put that into a well-respected software package and you can save that huge fee if you understand the process. I didn't until last night, although I did a straight will 2 years ago with WillMaker 2014. The software is very easy to follow and has been around so long, all the ""odd circumstances"" are in there.

If you don't want to spend over $350 for Sony Vegas Pro or over $700 for Adobe Premier Pro, then this Corel VideoStudio Pro is one of your best choices.  It has more features that any other sub-$100 video software program out there.

Compared to Adobe Premiere Elements 10 (Adobe's comparably priced video software), this software is just as easy to use but offers you many more options - like all the DSLR photo and videos features, the ability to work with huge video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160 pixels, ability to process the newest AVCHD 2.0 and AVCHD 3D video formats, Alpha Channels, slow-motion, and (most impressively) out of the box Blu-Ray video and disc rendering.  Adobe and Sony both require you to purchase another software program to render videos for Blu-ray discs.

To make this software even better, I haven't had it freeze up on my yet - which Premiere Elements would do too often for my liking - and the rendering process is faster.

Usually when companies release sub-$100 video software they give you dumbed-down versions of their pricier full-blown software... such as Adobe and Sony.

My main complaint was that the date field would revert to the current date whenever I temporarily left the entry to do something else. Frequently I ended up with several incorrect dates and had to go back and fix them.  Also I should mention that I only use the check registry and no other features.  This annoyance has been mostly corrected. You can go to Find, for example, and then return to the entry and the entered date will still be there.  If you wander too far, the date may revert, but the main problem has been resolved.  So far as I am concerned, this would be the main reason to upgrade from the 2008 version.

I did not find the new features useful.  I cannot make the ""flag"" feature do anything, so I gave up on it.  Now I would like to make OCCASIONAL use of the Tag and Notes features, but to do that, I would have to make them  available.  The problem is that this would add two extra keystrokes when entering a check as the Amount column is at the end.  Quicken claims that you can arrange the register's columns anyway you like, but I found I could not move the Amount column to be next to the Category field so as to avoid the extra keystrokes.  You would think that fields that are not used for every entry would be placed after the Amount field which has to be filled in for every entry.  Of course one could theoretically hide Tag and Notes and call them up only when needed, but surely the information on them ought to be visible all the time so that one does not overlook it. In any event, it is much easier to stick a notation into the Memo field rather than call up two other fields from time to time.

In all fairness, I think the Attachment feature might be useful but I have not yet have had occasion to try it.
In conclusion, if you do not yet have a program for keeping track of your checks or finances, I would strongly recommend Quicken Deluxe 2011.  Over the many years I have used Quicken, it has undoubtedly saved me hundreds of dollars in duplicate contributions or extended subscriptions, and thousands of hours of time.

1. DRM.  Using NetFlix with a TV means you have to have a direct HDCP-enabled connection from the computer to the TV if you're using HDMI to connect to the TV.  Putting a receiver in the middle of the mix breaks the HDCP stream and ""protected"" streams don't play.  You get a mysterious unhelpful ""DRM error"" instead of something useful.

2. When using this as a HTPC, I had to turn off ""super fetch"" and indexing and defragmenting.  Why does Windows defrag automatically?  There's really no reason to do this these days and it can result in data loss if disk blocks are moved over deleted files (i.e., you can no longer recover deleted files).

3. Software updates are just as annoying as they were with XP.  Come back to your computer to use it and find that it's been rebooted.  As a HTPC, this isn't a big deal--as a workstation it's a huge issue to me.  I just leave the updates on because of how I'm using the computer, but as a workstation I'd turn it off.

4. The Aero interface is pretty to look at.  Modern hardware as of late 2008 can handle it just fine.  I'm using a $140 motherboard w/ integrated ATI graphics and a $70 Pentium dual-core processor and everything is slick and fast.  Hardware has caught up with Vista.

Photo Director Six, however, is more sophisticated and gives new ways to enhance and manage your photos. The user interface hasn't changed much. If you're familiar with Photo Director Five it's basically the same: a large window for your photo, editing tools run down the left side, and thumbnails of your photos for editing across the bottom.

The installation and registration went smoothly. I use the Windows version for Windows 7, but it also works on Mac.

The new tools I particularly like are body shaper, face swap, and the ability to remove unwanted figures from the photo. Body shaper is great fun. It allows you to pull in the outline of a figure, an easy way to lose fifty pounds. The face swap is handy for selecting the best facial expressions for a group photo from several versions of the picture. Being able to remove unwanted from your photo is a great way to clean up the background.

The slide show is easy to set up, just drag the photos from the thumbnail list at the bottom into the picture section above. You can sequence them any way you want. My only criticism is that it's a very basic slide show. Cyberlink Power Director has more interesting slide shows. However, this slide show is adequate to display your photos.

My favorite feature of the Cyberlink products is the extensive presets that can be used to give your pictures different HDR effects, enhance the scenery, change skin tone, and a number of others. Additional presets can be downloaded from Cyberlink.

 However, this app is somewhat disconcerting in the long, long list of permissions it demands. User guidance on the whole is limited both within the program and the Kaspersky website. I wound up having to go their knowledgebase for information on uninstalling from one device and installing on another. The subject is not explicitly addressed, though there are thorough instructions for uninstalling and installing. I guess that you would just uninstall on one device and install on the other, providing the same activation code. I guess  Id much rather know for sure in advance of the event.

 Many of the advertised features are available only for phones using a SIM card. They don't mention that on the packaging and you have to hunt a little to find it in the in-program help.

 Installation went smoothly. An initial scan indicated no virus or malware issues.

 Setting up the remote locate, lock and wipe feature is a hassle and there doesnt appear to be a way to test without essentially destroying your own device. I don't have faith in something I cant test working when I have a critical need for it. There should be some way to do a dry run. (Since I didn't activate these features until I could get more information, I don't know if there is after you activate the anti-theft protection. If there is an ability to dry run, they should mention it, I think.)

 The trouble with a program like this is there is no convenient way for an individual user to know how effective the app actually is. I haven't found any independent third-party tests.

 So overall, I cant say with confidence if Kaspersky Lab Security for Android actually works. Given the companys reputation, I suppose it does, but I think that Kaspersky ought to provide an independent certification of its efficiency.

 I didn't notice any performance issues on the WiFi only tablet I installed it on, but I will keep an eye out.

 Will I leave the program installed on the tablet? For a little while at least. But I am really not at all sure of how well the app works and remain a little bit skeptical.

When installing the Power Director 13, Make sure you read the EULA, I cannot emphasize that enough.
The Power Director has Many editing tools, and the thought that springs to mind is maybe it has too many or too much in the way of tools; with some products you feel like saying, just focus on a few things that you do well, and do that or do those.

In the Install process, it asks ""do you want to install Smart Sound"", and this is a no brainer; quite a good add-on, and works well with other products.
I favour the use of Still photos, and making them ""pop"" for want of a better phrase, and there-in lies my learning curve. You can use video from the SAMSUNG memory cam which is really for basic Video. Some quite good video can be obtained from the Canon Eos T5, and then you just edit. If you have Photo shop, this can work some wonders , since a live shot with reminisces  of other times, or maybe some people who have passed, can be trasnitioned in as the person on the video talks. When you use this, Audio tracks work wonders; you can have a basic music track, and then if you have audio of the person who has passed, or other people talking about a person ( alive or passed ), then this product can transition the audio, and the images. So cool.

Make sure that you have plenty of memory, and if needs be, use a dedicated PC or , laptop or desktop, with at least 12 gig ( mine has 12 ) so that you can easily edit the large slab of content. If you have less than 12 gig of ram, use more virtual memory, and shut down unnecessary applications so you can grab all the available CPU and memory. I am not a fan of the Cloud option, so forget that, in my view. And use a second drive. If you have a SSD drive, use that for your virtual, especially if you can link that in with a USB 3 cable.

All in all this is a great editing set. Also, if you really feel like using the second disc with optional extras, be careful, since it chews up CPU and memory like crazy.
The capability is immense, but make sure you have the tools to use this great product . Some of the specs for memory and CPU on the box seem more than a tad optimistic, and I would say that easily you would need to double it. I have had problems at times with 12 Gig, and I was being careful. The 3 D options are neat. Also, use a Blue Screen or neutral colour backdrop for some elements you want to import, especially if you do a kind of interview scenario for the PIP ( picture in Picture) elements.

It does have some added value over online mapping solutions. However, it also has a lot of issues and in the end it is not a product I would pay for.

It is easier to create detailed multi stop routes using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 than using online mapping solutions. I especially like the ""Find Nearby Places"" feature. The Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 application also has a lot more options and settings and it is easier to personalize. It is nice that you can work off-line and save your plans as a document, reload the file, update the route, save again, etc.

You are also supposed to be able to download your routes to your GPS device. This would be a nice feature if it worked. However, I have never gotten this to work. I have no problem downloading maps and other features to my GPS devices from, for example, the Garmin web site and other sites. However, I get ""device not detected"" no matter which Garmin GPS I use, and no matter which USB port I use, and no matter which computer I use, despite the fact that all USB ports work and my Garmin devices have no problem communicating with other sites.

The Help does not contain anything helpful, and none of the on-line information I found was helpful. I tried a number of things that did not work. Microsoft thinks it is the vendor who should inform you whether the GPS device is compatible with Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and the vendor nearly dies laughing when he hears that. Basically, customer support does not exist and you won't get any help, and it simply does not work. Well, I know that some lucky people get this to work but from reading forums I know this is a common unresolved issue.

Anyway, other things I do not like is that Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 is notorious for freezing up and the route path on the map is way too thick and ugly and I did not find a setting to change it. I also don't think the maps look that nice. Between the online mapping solutions (Google maps, MapQuest, Bing, etc) and my GPS devices Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 adds very little value and with the issues I don't think this product is worth its price.

It has its own database, which can make installation challenging.  After installation, the setup wizard asks you to select your accounting method - cash basis or accrual.  Once an accounting method is selected, a GUInterface appears to help you navigate the software such as your preference in flowchart formatting.  The software shows YTD revenue, accounts payable, accounts receivable, account balances, and display graphics such as pie charts displaying pertinent data.  These are accomplished via widgets.

Sage 50 allows data to be transferred to Microsoft Excel (2003+) spreadsheets, which is a wonderful feature.  It has an enhanced batch check printing for payroll & accounts payable.

What I don't like is that I cannot import data into Excel from any other software so switching over to it is initially tedious.

I've been using it now as my primary e-mail client for about three months. So far, so good.

I had little to no problems installing Outlook 2007. I'm using XP, and my Office suite is 2000. I like the GUI, but not all documents (especially Word and HTML docs) render as they do in their native apps, and I'm assuming this is because my other Office apps are getting way old.

Also, I appreciate that Outlook 2007 lets you add RSS feeds. I subscribe to many newsletter and blog reports and find this feature useful. I've had no problems with just the e-mail reading/organizing capabilities; everything there works just fine.

Like many people writing reviews here, I'm disappointed that Outlook 2007 with BCM is so slow. I used to use Outlook Express as my e-mail client, which is pretty fast compared to Outlook 2007, so maybe it's just a matter of getting used to the new app.

I was hoping this app would allow me to do more with billing and invoicing, but I've read a few blogs and discovered to get Business Contact Manager to really do all it can do (which is probably a lot), you'll need Microsoft Accounting installed, too. I'm considering buying that app, but I wish I didn't have to.

The full functionality of the app is a bit beyond me at this point (again, I'm upgrading from Outlook Express, so the learning curve is no surprise), but I hope this changes with time. Right now, I find myself using the same three or four functions all the time, which is normal. It's how I generally use the other apps in the Office group.

I've found myself in the past criticizing certain aspects of other Microsoft products (Word in particular), only to find out later these apps had the ability to do what I wanted them to do all along, but I just didn't know it.

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.

Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.

Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.

You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.

In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.

Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.

One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.

Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.

One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.

I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.

Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.

Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.

Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.

I have studied and used several languages for work, and Japanese has been on my list for a while.  Like most tools this software should probably be used in combination with other tools.  Learning the Kanji character alphabet will probably be the hardest with the included method.  While it does help you with building a vocabulary, learning the intricacies of the various formal tenses is also something that may need to be augmented.  Still, this is an excellent resource for the serious language learner who wants to learn a little bit at a time. The high cost may stop some people but overall it's probably worth it for those serious about learning Japanese.

The Product

The product that includes the 3 levels is definitely a better value than the single level products, which won't provide enough content to allow even basic speaking ability.  Included you will find:
1) Nice quality printed manuals
2) Software CDs for all 3 levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced
3) Audio companion CDs for all 3 levels, also a huge extra and well worth the extra $50
4) A basic computer headset with headphones and a microphone

Overall, the box seems somewhat small.  But once you see all that's included within it, you will understand where your money went.  There's a lot of content packed on those disks, which is what you pay for.

The Method

The full immersion method forces you to avoid the traditional translation of other learning methods.  The good thing is that it helps you to quickly gain the basics in terms of vocabulary and comprehension. The challenge is of course that you must work much harder to learn grammar and written syntax.  This version does allow you to see and learn some characters along with the lessons, but most serious learners will still want to augment this immersion method with some traditional study too.

The software allows you to focus on language areas.  There is less emphasis on repetition within modules, but you can repeat them as desired if you prefer drills.  The USB headset allows you to repeat phrases and improve your accuracy, which also facilitates learning.  The structure is very good and the integrated visuals along with the audio will allow you to gain confidence quicker than other methods. Since many people learn visually and others learn by hearing, this method allows both groups to learn effectively.

You can also begin to learn to read basic Japanese characters by selecting that option.  The program allows you to select traditional roman characters or Japanese.  There are also exercises that test your comprehension by making selections onscreen.

The method may be overwhelming at first for some people, but is actually easier than traditional learning.  The only qualms I have with it is that I personally do learn a little better with traditional grammar and repetition methods.

The Software

The software is very good, but not error free.  I was somewhat surprised by how demanding it was.  I did experience a few errors that required me to restart the program, as well as some general slowness moving between sections.  I recently upgraded the RAM on my computer, and have had more responsiveness since then.  However, you are limited to installing this on one machine as far as I could tell.  So from that perspective, make sure you install it on a good one that you feel comfortable with.

The audio companions are perhaps more akin to traditional programs I am familiar with.  These have been a great addition for me.  I started out only using the software and have begun to augment with the CDs too.

Coming from somebody who is used to learning a language from a combination of Barron's programs and books, this program is a very welcome addition to my toolbox.  I would still recommend using those other programs to augment your study though.  Particularly, books on characters like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Kanji-2-000-Basic-Japanese-Characters-Systematically-Arranged-For-Learning-And-Reference/dp/0834802228/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Kanji: 2,000 Basic Japanese Characters Systematically Arranged For Learning And Reference</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schaum-s-Outline-of-Japanese-Grammar/dp/0071342206/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schaum's Outline of Japanese Grammar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-Kanji-Flashcards-Vol-1-Third-Edition/dp/0974869449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese Kanji Flashcards, Vol. 1 (Third Edition)</a>&nbsp;are going to be very useful if you need to learn for more than just conversation.

Relatively speaking, I suppose the Pimsleur programs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-III-2nd-Ed-Learn-to-Speak-and-Understand-Japanese-with-Pimsleur-Language-Programs-Pimsleur-Language-Program/dp/0743528859/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese III - 2nd Ed.: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Language Program)</a>would be considered comparable in price to these, though they are also more expensive if you buy each level individually.  Relative to those, there is no comparison.  This software approach wins hands down and is actually a better value.

Conclusion

This is a great language program and should do the trick if, like many people, you are not a fan of the traditional memorization method that is common in language learning.  While the investment is significant, it's well worth if you're serious about learning Japanese.

When it comes to traveling, I am usually the individual that shows up late simply because I found myself taking the wrong turn, accidentally adventuring into a dangerous neighborhood, and then finding myself eventually on the wrong side of the city...  You get the picture!  Driving and finding new places really isn't my best skill set, to say it nicely.  ;-)

However, for those of us that really do need ""step-by-step navigational directions"", this program is GREAT!  Here's what I like about Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009 (with GPS):

1) Easy to use with turn-by-turn directions...

Say that I want to go to the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon National Parks for a summer vacation.  I can click on ""Route Planner"" and then type in the name of various places that I wish to visit and it will look up their addresses for me automatically.  It automatically figures out the shortest route for me and provides me with nearly instant step-by-step driving directions!  I no longer need to carry around bulky maps or punch in addresses manually into a portable GPS.  ;-)  It simply finds what I need and guides me right there.

Also, it allows me to put together a vacation planner, stating how many days I want to be at a certain location, when I plan to depart, etc.  This really makes it easy to figure out how long one's trip will take, when you will arrive back home, etc.

2) Up-to-Date Maps

I recently moved into a brand new house and nearly none of the major mapping companies have my place listed on their maps -- well, except for this program!

3) Lost?  Need Directions Now?

Simply press the space bar and the program will instantly speak to you, providing you with the driving directions you need.

4) GPS looks like a USB flash drive and comes with a convenient extension cord.

Best thing is that this GPS also works with Google Earth too (in Windows), which is always nice to know.  I also tried the GPS with Google Earth on a Mac, but it didn't work.

What I don't like about this program:

1) The voice is acceptable, but does seem kind of mechanical.  Sometimes, it also speaks a bit fast, which can make comprehension difficult at times.

2) I find the ""find coupons"" and ""restaurants"" features to be a bit unrefined.  For example, if I am traveling in Arizona on my way to the Grand Canyon, looking for fast food, it recommended a variety of places -- including restaurants in the state of ""Louisiana.""  Sorry, but I'm not traveling that far just to eat.

Overall, the program is good buy for those who are looking for a program with up-to-date maps with GPS, step-by-step navigation.  Love it!",Works Great for Me!,1245283200,3,

I purchased a good digital microphone and installed the software.  Setup seemed easy enough and the learning software was reasonable.  I didn't use it much because it seemed to have problems with Microsoft products (though I could buy an upgrade that - in theory - worked better).  A couple weeks later I purchased another piece of software for learning a foreign language and soon neither worked.  I uninstalled the language software and reinstalled the Dragon software and was plagued by a window that was always trying to re initiate the program (never successfully).

But over the years I moved on to using Microsoft Word as it became the de facto standard in most work places. I pretty much quit using MS Office at home when I left teaching and switched over to using a free license of Open Office. But I've been wanting to get back to using something a bit more polished. So when I was offered to try out the latest standard WordPerfect office suite from Corel I was happy to do so.

Installation was a snap. Individual icons get created on your desktop, as well as on the program menu. I'm running Windows 7 Professional.

WordPerfect is a lot different than it was back in the DOS days, but still very similar to any of the other Windows based word processors I've used over the years. I really haven't had to hunt too long to find where everything is located. Quattro-Pro is great, I use to use it a long time ago and am very happy to start using it again. Presentations - back when I was teaching, I use to create a ton of slideshows. Nowdays I really don't have a need to.

To test this new suite out, I opened a lot of my archived curriculum that I've developed over the years. Pretty much everything opened and worked fine. One minor quibble, some of the Powerpoint files had a issue with the display order of things - for example, text blocks that were obscured by graphics. But nothing that wasn't easily fixed. Quattro-Pro was a standout, everything I tried worked perfect and there were more options than I think I've ever seen for presenting data.

One thing that I really wanted to test out, but haven't had the opportunity is the ebook creation function of WordPerfect. I really want to set down and test this out more before commenting on it. I will update my review when that is done.

** Note : Just the AVG antivirus is available for free [...], comes with a complete antivirus but lacks comprehensive protection.

+ves
======
 + 80 million users world wide - means somebody would have already found the virus & signature before it affects your computer.  I do not know if there is any other anti virus make who can claim such a comprehensive database of virus signatures.
 + Thin memory & CPU footprint  - means this software takes little CPU power and leaves the rest to your main programs
 + 2 year subscription - compare this with 1 year subscription which most manufacturers provide today.  2 years at this price is a steal
 + AVG has been in business since 1992 - maintained a low profile, spends little on marketing, and more on R&D - a very decent company who are committed to providing the best antivirus for the market

-ves
======
 - this product may not work with Windows 7, it mentions that it works only with windows xp, vista & 2000

  - This definitely rates far better than PC Tools & McAfee
  - Comparing AVG with Kaspersky is difficult, Kaspersky is an equally good anti-virus.  But the 2-year subscription on AVG at this price makes it more attractive than Kaspersky.",Comprehensive protection with little or no performance impact,1260662400,,

TT requires you to buy TT Premier at a cost that is 2x that of HRBlock Deluxe.  I found HRBlock excellent and installed on my Mac quickly without problems.  It imported last year Turbotax files as well as Quicken for Mac 2015 files without error. I found HR Block easier to use and the import was more complete than Turbtax (TT) deluxe.  I am very happy with the shift to HRBlock. All of my fears of shifting tax software were unfounded. TT has gotten greedy and others should consider letting the market send a loud no buy message to Intuit (TT parent).  After using HRBlock I probably would not shift back to TT even if they dropped their price and made thier Deluxe version with the same features as their 2013 product.  I have found HRBlock to be an excellent product and accurate. I obviously have not yet tested the efiling portion of the program but I am assuming no glitches.

  I've used Norton and McAfee and fund plenty to criticize in them. Over the past few years, in fact, my impression is that both brands have become bloated and slow.

  BitDefender is a pleasant surprise. Installation is fast and the installer is well done.

  Funtionally, BitDefender is very smooth. Setup is extremely efficient and the number of intrusive pop-ups is low. Firewall installation is very simple compared to some other packages. BitDefender does an excellent job of recognizing legitimate applications and letting their traffic pass through.

  The range of services is impressive, though some of them such as IM Encryption would appear to be of dubious value in the real world.

  The BitDefender CD is bootable (it runs under Knoppix Linux, a very dependable distribution) and can be used to ""analyze/repair/disinfect"" a compromised system.

  The feature list of BitDefender Total Security 2009 is long - 22 by BitDefender's count. The important functions seem to be well regarded. BitDefender came out on top in an allegedly independent test of antivirus detection.

  It will take me a while to assess the value of AES encrypted storage capabilities (great if it works); a gamer mode that limits security during online gameplay (unlikely something I'll ever use, but very valuable to families with online gamers), local network management (appears to be somewhat limited compared to other products); online backup, privacy protection and so on.

  One quality that is high on my list is antivirus scanning speed and overhead. On this one factor, BitDefender is a clear winner. It scans at an impressively high speed and doesn't bog down the system as Norton and McAfee do. On one Norton equipped computer where I have the antivirus scan set for late evening, it often starts while I am still working. Nine times out of ten, I'll shut Norton down because it is such a resource hog.

  Not so with BitDefender.

  Overall, BitDefender Total Security 2009 is a very impressive package in terms of capabilities and price. If it holds up under continuous use and scrutiny, I can see it (happily) as a replacement for Norton and McAffee, Well worth checking out in your own environment.

In fact, with the 2011 version, I had a problem where all of a sudden it said my subscription was running out and I knew I still had months left on it.  I first used McAfee's Virtual Technician online to determine and fix the problem if it could.  If I remember correctly, it then gave me a link to click for a ""live person"" to chat with online, or it advised me to go to the live chat link.  I couldn't believe the care and service I received.  It was fantastic.  With my permission, the McAfee tech guy ""took control"" of my computer just for the purpose of repairing the problem that I had with the McAfee Internet Security program.  I stayed at my computer and watched in awe as my cursor, without my assistance, clicked this and that and new things popped up and screens changed and more clicks and then I'd be prompted to enter information.  They totally fixed the problem with no complaints from me as to the time it took or the knowledge of the tech.  In fact, I then received a phone call asking me to check ""this and that"" under certain categories, especially the subscription expiration date to be sure all was as it should be.

I do notice a slight slow down when it is scanning while I'm using the computer but nothing of any great significance.

This product is called WinZip 18 Pro but after you start the setup, which gives you an option of 32-bit or 64-bit, it indicates that it is WinZip 17 [in most cases you should choose 64-bit unless your computer will simply not function at the 64-bit level]. After the option is offered, click install. Depending on what you are going to use WinZip 18 Pro for, you should probably take a careful look at the EULA, since this states that the software is licensed to you, not sold to you. Businesses, whether small or especially larger businesses, are required to maintain records of installations for audits. The terms of use are especially relevant since the privacy points states that information can and will be automatically collected. Although WinZip user feedback gives an opt out selection, this may apply to certain things, but it does not mean that the information will not be collected. In setting up your given options and the associations selection has key choices with implications for security, and this would be very relevant for businesses. There is an option to check for updates which gives auto,  ask, and do not check; my recommendation in all cases is for the system to ask, since auto will cause a lot of problems potentially.
  Registration using serial number is different to the registration code. The ""as is"" warranty disclaimer appearing during registration is somewhat at odds with the EULA. The warranty seems to cover WinZip, WinZip Courier, and WinZip self extractor.
  The program is structured like office 2013. Social media and cloud options are extensive and these are all integrated into the ribbon structure. The create/share option is part of this, as is copy to , backup, tools (diagnostics are important, especially for fixing corrupt zip files); and settings, view (which contains various themes for the program), help and the knowledge base is very useful, but much of it can be worked out either by working with the program, or testing what you want to do.
  The last version of this program that I had was WinZip 14 plus. The jump between version 14 plus and version 18 Pro is mostly in the technical nitty-gritty, however the cloud and the encryption elements of the two largest expansions. WinZip 18 Pro has many elements that a business can use, however some of the cloud and social media elements have dubious business value mainly because of some severe security issues, and this is probably where in the out-of-the-box situation it would work well for a home use situation. Whatever the case, the advanced elements need to be looked at very carefully since they will be suited for some, and will need very stringent controls for other WinZip users who want to use the extensive capabilities for zip and encryption, but avoid cloud and social media.","Complex/advanced, capable and efficient",1396656000,,

I am impressed with Corel WordPerfect Office X7. It is easy to use, it handles any task I require with ease, and the interface is clean and intuitive...its a pleasure to work in Corel WordPerfect Office X7.

Compatibility is a feature Corel has long served its customers, as is evident with the nearly fifty save as options within its WordPerfect application, compared to the seventeen options I find within my Microsoft Word application.

The intuitive nature of WordPerfect Office X7 makes it easy to find commands as they're needed. There is no need to hop around ribbon menus, only to find that font selection is done in a thing called Home, whereas, Corel places this formatting task under a menu called Format. It doesnt get much better than that.

I enjoy Microsoft Excel more than Quattro Pro, which lacks the fill tool, which is one of my favorite convenience features. The interface isn't as tidy and pleasant, but it is still a capable spreadsheet program.

I have not done much with Presentations, but I do like the right hand side column of quick access buttons, allowing quick access to commonly used editing and playback features.

I installed WordPerfect Lightning, and I have yet to make use of it. This is Corels answer to Microsofts OneNote, but it is nowhere nearly as inviting. Its a tool that does not seem interesting or useful enough to warrant taking the time to master it. Its there for those who wish to use it.

Having installed disc burning software in the past, only to find that my built-in disc burning started misbehaving, I chose not to install this one either. Im not burning discs, anyway, as I have plenty of HDD backup, but for those who wish to take advantage of security-enabled data on an optical disc, it is an option.

Comparison of Corel WordPerfect Office X7, is probably best done against the Home and Business version of Microsoft Office 2013, when considering price. They cost about the same, and both suites offer anchor software titles for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. The extension software is where the differences exist, and it really comes down to whether or not you prefer Microsofts OneNote and Outlook over Corels WordPerfect Lightning and the Roxio Secure Disc Burning software.

I do love this suite, for the most part.

Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.

I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem.

Works seemed to find non existent problems and used lots of resources. Since Norton Anti-Virus cost just about the same price as Systems works did I opted for one of the free anti-virus programs (Avast) and was very happy. I also have a Mac and use no Norton software on it.

Recently I obtained a new HP Vista computer and was happily running Avast on it with no problems. But I missed several programs I had on my XP system that did things like defrag my hard drive, keep track of my passwords, etc. So when this program became available in the Amazon Vine program and I noticed it had those separate programs that I had by other companies now incorporated all into one program called Norton 360 I decided to give it a try.

I had no problem loading the software and it seemed to configure effortlessly upon it's first start up. I've used all of the features on it thus far except the backup program. I am unclear as if the backup only works to the skimpy on-line disc space that comes with the product (more can be rented for what seems a fairly astronomical price). The features of the program seem to work well so far in all the areas I have tried.

I've read many of the other reviews for this program and it seems I may be praising it too soon since I've only had it installed about 3 weeks so far (on a 6 week old PC) and it seems that things begin to go sour shortly after that - we'll see. I would agree that it seems to work best with new computers with fresh Vista installations (Ultimate version in my case on a 6 week old PC). It seems to incur all sorts of problems on older systems with Vista upgrades.

So I'm taking a cautious approach and think that it's an average program that tries to do a lot, and if you have  the need or desire for these features and a fairly new computer it will probably work well for you.

While this program does do what it claims to do and is fairly easy to use, its negatives outweigh them by far.

As a complex software system, there is NO EXCUS for not providing LIVE support personnel since many of the people who would use this software are fairly computer illiterate.

Second is that installation of this software automatically changes the file associations of all photo and video files. I NEVER allow any software to change even a single association unless I give it permission to do so. NEVER.

To tell customers that your software  screwed up all of their associations and it I up to them to go back and fix the damage is beyond belief.

But the last time I looked those programs were more than 4 times as expensive and targeted to an entirely different audience. For what it is and what it costs, Bento is pretty (expletive deleted) good. It's easy to use, easy to learn and well integrated with Address Book and iCal. With that integration it can quickly be massaged into a capable project management database. For those missing the database in Appleworks it is a definite upgrade.

I wanted a bird watching database that would include photos, recordings of songs, places, sighting dates, descriptions, related species and miscellaneous notes. I'm collecting information, not doing calculations this is a nice fit.

Within 45 minutes of installing the program I had my forms ready and was entering data. Being a designer, I went back and prettied up my forms a bit but that wasn't necessary. I went back and looked at the tutorials later and they seem pretty good.  My first inclination was to build the db in MySQL and put a web front end to it but that would be a lot of work. Bento was just what the doctor ordered. Bento is a little funky in the way it does joins but is a kind of relational database. But then I didn't want to mess with SQL anyway.

I would like to see some Applescript capabilities and a bit more flexibility in printing reports. I haven't tried to integrate Bento with Automator. With no Applescript dictionary, I'm not hopeful. But scripting a database is not something I would expect the target market for this app to even think of, or if they did, they would run screaming in terror.

In those days (~1980) there wasn't the pressure on companies to provide copy protection to their software, so I put in the floppies one by one. I think that in those days Corel wanted their program to get the most exposure so maybe they didn't mind.

If so, it was worth their while, because I upgraded to version two, and carried on until version 6. To start with, Corel was the only program on the block that gave PC owners the kind of programs that Adobe was supplying for the Mac. Corel took that one step further and gave us a one-stop shopping product that had everything that a PC owner would want in graphics at the time.

That meant a drawing program, and usually a couple of other graphics programs as well. But Corel also included in the box a number of fonts, and plenty of clip art. This attitude has continued up to now with a whole bunch of applications, most in the box, but some (like Painter) have a separate existence.

Unfortunately, putting all this graphics power into the hands of people who weren't trained led to some recurring design mistakes, like heading text that went across the whole page in an arc, or parts of the page having a box around it. Add to that the people who would add clip art to every blank space, and it was easy to tell a document that had the ""Corel Treatment.""

Luckily most of those people have decided to drop the superfluous touches since then, and reasonably carefully used Corel Draw can help would-be artists improve their work. In fact, the program is probably the most user-friendly in that Corel includes a high-quality color book that invites the user to ""Give it a try"" for each feature. Corel comes with the book, a slipcase, the DVD, and a quick keyboard guide.

Included in the book are some winners of the Corel Design Award, and as I looked at them, not only was I impressed with the work that could be created on something other than the ""industry-leader"" applications, I notice that the majority of the creations came from areas outside the USA. This, I believe, shows the popularity of the low price around the world. In fact, you're paying around a third of the price of the equivalent Adobe apps.

And if the list price of nearly five hundred dollars is too high, Corel on Amazon offers numerous lower-priced versions, including Home and Educational (i.e. not Commercial) and previous versions of the programs and suites.

I love Photoshop but I'd be willing to use Corel's PhotoPaint if times were tough. Like the relationship between Corel Draw and Illustrator, PhotoPaint has most of the features of Photoshop. Add to that the things to help the beginner, and unless you're committed to a career in Graphics CorelDraw's X5 suite will probably have all you need.

I'm impressed that it handles RAW files, that it had an HDR module, that it not only performs the basic image editing and color correction functions but it also does photo blending, skin smoothing, and noise removal, that it has text functions, works with layers and 16-bit images--really does a lot for the money!

Is it capable of doing everything at a top professional level? I don't think so. But it has enough power so that the average person's normal photograph with typical problems will very well processed with minimal effort.

So if you buy this I think it is wise to plan to do a ""clean"" install (this means you lose all your programs and settings so you'd need a thorough backup of your data).

In summary, I'm hard pressed to come up with a reason why someone running a stable WinXP system would want Vista Home Premium.  Having said that I do think it is a competent operating system and IF it is on a Vista Certified system then I think it is fine.  Nothing in my experience with Vista would cause me to want to ""downgrade"" from a stable Vista install to XP.

PLEASE NOTE: The most important thing I may be able to say here is that Remote Desktop is crippled in this version of Vista.  You can remote OUT to other computers but you cannot remote IN to a PC running Vista Home Premium.

Munro,"I purchased this software to have a robust ability to restore my hard drive completely (not just user data) in the case of a drive failure.  This is what the ""image backup"" functionality is for, to allow you to re-create a fully-operational version of your system very quickly in the event of a drive failure.  (As opposed to just a data backup, which still requires you to reinstall the operating system, programs, and all your user settings again from scratch.)

So, here's my take:
1) First, any of the positive reviews that have not actually tried to use their backups to restore should really not be given much weight.  If you can backup fine, but can't restore, what's the point?
2) I am running Windows Vista with a 1 TB drive, and this program worked fine in creating the image backup.
3) When my drive started throwing off errors, and I replaced it with a new one, I went to my Acronis boot CD to restore from my backup image (on an external drive.)  Part way through the restore wizard, the restore program just froze, for no apparent reason.  And I have been completely unable to restore my system from my backup.

Here is the experience I had with the technical support:
- You should know that by default, technical support is only available via email with a 48 hr response time.  While this seems reasonable for only paying $40 for a software product, a 48-hour response time makes the product fairly meaningless in the event of a failure, as I can easily restore the operating system and programs from scrtach in less time than this (and just use the free built-in windows backup for a data restore).
- I went ahead and paid an extra $30 for a single-incident ""premium support"", which is real-time phone support.  However, after 3 separate phone calls, each on hold for 20-30 minutes and NEVER getting a live person (I had to leave a messages), I finally received some email communications which contained solutions that made no impact to my issue.
- The Tech Support emails provided new ""CD images"" that they wanted me to use instead of my standard boot CD.  (I'm not sure, but I doubt most folks have an extra PC and CD burner sitting around to be abe to do this, when their main PC is dead.)
- Then I received an email asking me to reformat a flash drive, plug it into my dead computer, and write a batch script that would execute numerous lines of Linux command line codes.  Ok, I'm a pretty technical guy, but I'm not familiar with Linux.

The problem with ZA being a cpu pig continues to be bad. The process scanningprocess.exe still hogs the CPU every time you try to use the computer.  Turning it off under  ""antivirus - advanced options"" restores the performance of your computer at the expense of ZA not scanning every file that comes into the cpu. Most of the files that you use are simply routine application files that ZA checks over and over at the expense of bringing the performance to a crawl. What you want ZA to check are new files that it has not seen before, but ZA is not smart enough to make the distinction. Norton Security Suite used to be the champion CPU pig along with McAfee, but Norton has now solved the problem. Both XP and VISTA will run smoothly with Norton with only a very modest tax on performamnce (unless you look you will never notice its tiny affects). It's too bad. ZA has been my favorite for many years. I like the level of control it gives you and I like the near-perfect firewall, but the perfromance hit is too much. Now, Nortin has improved its firewall and Antivirus components to match or exceed ZA. For me it's bye-bye ZA, and buy-buy Norton.

Previous Review
ZoneAlarm 7.1 for Vista is not ready for retail sale. Once you install it with Vista, your computer will likely slow to a crawl. The reason is simple (for most people).  Zonealarm security suite will continuously run two processes, both called scanningprocess.exe, that along with another ZoneAlarm process, VSMON.exe, will consume most of your cpu. There seems to be no way to turn this off. On my machine, a new Lenovo with 2GB of ram, the cpu useage bounces around from 17% to 90%, with most of the time being above 50%. WIth so much of the computer's resources consumed, there is little left for you, the user. Plus, if you do something,such as starting a program, the useage jumps even higher. Finally, even though ZoneAlarm has just finished updating its files, it will continuously run updclient.exe, which takes up about 25% of the cpu.  The company that produces ZoneAlarm, CheckPoint, will not respond to customer inquiry about this problem. So, go ahead and install it, and see if I am right.

After posting this message, I have found a way to ""solve"" the problem of ZoneAlarm being CPU pig. You will have to turn off ""On Access Scanning"".  Go to the AntiVirus/AntiSpyware tab and click on ""Advanced Options"", the click on ""On Access Scanning"".  Uncheck the Enable Box. Click OK.  In a few minutes your computer should return to normal civilized behavior.  You have lost a valuable feature, but, hey, you can actually do something useful on your computer.  This problem does not seem to affect the older versions under XP.  Good Luck!

You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October. If you are updating from Leopard, Apple has continued to make it inexpensive for a family using more than one machine by pricing the upgrade at about $10.00 a machine (assuming you use all five). Not bad.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!",More than meets the eye,1251417600,41,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UZLAFQPSL._SY88.jpg']

So the two great advantages Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac offers are compatibility and productivity:

COMPATIBILITY:  Using the defacto standard means that you can usually readily open the files you receive, and that others can usually open the files you send.  (And if they can't, they will ironically consider that to be their fault, not yours, and make the effort to open the file.  Unless they are paying you!)

PRODUCTIVITY:  Tens of millions of people have invested a lot of hours into learning how to use Microsoft Office - understanding the features, concepts, and quirks.  Choosing Office for Mac takes advantage of that investment.  Of course, if it worked identically to the PC version, that might be the ideal way to take advantage of the experience and training people have.

Of all the Toast versions, Toast 7 STILL gets the highest ratings on Amazon.  Here is why I still use it every time after all these years...

1.  Toast 10 just starts Exporting ALL THE SONGS (to fill up your hard drive with songs you don't want), and way too fast for good quality.  With Toast 7 you just: Insert a CD, drag it to the Toast window, and then CHOOSE THE SONGS you want to Export, and then choose High Quality.

2.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to Export from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are NO options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Exporting either.  With Toast 7 you can Export music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.

3.  Toast 7 makes perfect CDs every time.  I literally have NOT ended up with a ""coaster"" since about three computers ago, over 10 years ago.  I do use good blanks, but every blank I have tried has burned perfectly.

4.  With Toast 7 you can EASILY change the space between tracks from 0 to 8 seconds.  Zero seconds between tracks is essential for concept albums... Everything from Pink Floyd's the Wall to Disney's Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack, plus Classical Symphonies and Piano Concertos, and a few Tomita CDs, etc...

5.  Toast 7 still works perfectly with Snow Leopard 10.6.8 which is the BEST Mac OS ever... Snow Leopard is Lean and Powerful and able to run many older programs that the newer Mac Operating Systems cannot run. When I am required to install Mavericks to sync my new iPhone 5, I am going to partition a new hard drive to boot from both Snow Leopard AND Mavericks.  There's just too many things about Mavericks that are not cool, and too many things about Snow Leopard that are still essential!!

Story-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.

Graphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.

Sound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.

Gameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.

Fun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.

Length-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.

Even with minor tweaks, Office 2010 offers essentially the same user experience as Office 2007.

Installation of Office 2010 on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional (and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed) took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. Although the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing calendar entries and display/printing preferences were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).

While the interface is familiar, application launch time is slightly faster, and there is improved feedback to users on recent files accessed in a navigation pane that appears under the File tab.

So, with a familiar interface, a problem-free install and apparent improvements in navigation and responsiveness...why 2 stars? Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement.

This suite is overpriced no matter how you slice it, and the lack of an upgrade price and package --which Microsoft touts as ""simplified""-- makes it more so.

If you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/student-version/dp/B00337D8U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""student version""</a>&nbsp;instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version. Many businesses also have arrangements for ""use at home"" versions at deep discounts. Consider this also.

Otherwise, unless you're just a ""current version junkie"" who enjoys having the latest and greatest version of every application, I can't offer a good case for spending this much on a set of tools that looks, feels and performs almost exactly like its predecessor.","Nothing new here: familiar interface, steep price",1308355200,2,

The reason above is why I discovered how much easier it was to get comfortable with CorelDraw and Student Suite X7.  Between the interface and the suggestions/help that the program provides this was a painless program to work on and through.  Watching the video tutorials also helped.  They took up almost 2 hours of time, BUT if you figure out how long you could spend cursing under your breath when you can't get a program to do what you want it to do (or what you think it should do) when you didn't think watching the videos are needed and I feel viewing them is an excellent investment.

I use it when it first comes out each year to do some quick tax calculations to plan my year end transactions.  For planning purposes where one does not have all the various forms from financial institutions, one must force the program to ignore certain missing information, or go back to the paper copies of the various forms received from those institutions in prior years.  These problems, of course, go away when one is doing the actual tax return, since those forms for the current year would be at hand.  This is only a problem when doing early estimates without the various forms.

I like that the program is constantly updated as one approaches the actual filing time, so that everything is current and up to date at the time of filing.

I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.

It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.

The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one ""audio"" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.

VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.

As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.

The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package.",The best reasonably priced video editing software on the market today,1219190400,2,

First - I had the same trouble doing the transfer as other users - there was no warning that the password on my old file had to be removed before the upgrade was installed, so I could not open my data file.

So, three hours later, having finally deduced that there was no other option than to uninstall 2013 and reinstall 2010, then remove the password, reinstall 2013 (but this time in a separate directory)and transferred the file and decided against a password for now, tried entering a few transactions.

Rubbish! Total RUBBISH! Entering a price for a listed option took no time at all, but after each entry, the program ground away for up to 20 seconds before allowing entry of the next option price. (Quicken does not download option prices correctly, so they have to be manually entered) Everything is slowed down in the Budget area, making the feature valueless. Presentation is  changed for many reports, so you have to re-learn report building, etc. etc. etc.

After trying the system for several days, I uninstalled 2013, returned to 2010 Premier, and pray that Microsoft will see the errors of their ways and bring MSMoney back. Of course, when I took the software back to the retailer from whom it was purchased, demanding refund, the store refused - but one of the clerks told me that ""lots"" of people had returned theirs as well, and Intuit's response had been that the customers were just trying to cheat their way out of paying for ""a perfectly good product.""

A last point - Intuit gives you an on-line discount of 20% on their garbage product, some banks tout that they have negotiated the same 20% discount - Amazon makes it 30% - but I wouldn't buy it again with a 100% discount and an apology letter from the Chairman of the Board of Intuit after he fired the Intuit developers and their over-paid management for this software travesty.

Glitches? You betcha !!! If you are working on a PC with a non-US keyboard and/or a non-US English compatible character set, you have to re-set your entire system to use the US English standard, which wreaks havoc with spreadsheets, correspondence and non-US proprietary software files. Reports are not easy to define when multiple currencies are involved, and currency conversion is confusing at best. Oh, yes - when you re-start your system after re-setting the character set, your internet connection parameters are lost, so figure on re-entering them from scratch - pay no attention to the error messages spat out by Quicken - they are wrong. Just re-set the connection, and re-start Quicken as soon as you calm down from your hissy fit about the absurdity of a badly-QC'd software from a $***&U*I outfit like Intuit.

BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! I have used TurboTax from this same renegade outfit since before the Roman Empire was founded, and whilst having the occasional gripe, loved the tax preparation software. But if you purchase TurboTax 2012, IT WILL NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM THE 2010 QUICKEN SOFTWARE - YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO 2013 QUICKEN IN ORDER TO TRANSFER YOUR FINANCIAL DATA FROM 2012 !!!

This kind of entrapment of customers - deception if you are feeling charitable, highway robbery if you are being realistic  - is totally unacceptable, reprehensible and borderline theft. My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???

This kind of maltreatment of customers is why I curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) will write a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they come.

If there is something that you want to do with physical media, and even some electronic media needs, this software will help you get it done.

With such an extensive software package, it's very difficult to thoroughly test every feature at one time. Therefore, as I test each component, I will update this review with my findings and adjust my overall rating if necessary.

Overall Impressions
-------------------
The umbrella software runs full-screen, looking very Windows 8 Metro/Modern inspired. While some people like to run their software full-screen, I consider it a waste of screen real estate. If I want to run it full-screen, Windows provides for that capability, as long as the software doesn't disable it, like this does. While not a major issue, I find that this speaks to the target audience that Nero is aiming for. Fortunately, this is a minor issue, and each application can be run separately, which avoids the full-screen launch screen altogether.

Blu-ray Player
--------------
I compared the Blu-ray player application against Corel WinDVD Pro 11, which was already installed. My test disc was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hobbit-An-Unexpected-Journey-Extended-Edition-HD/dp/B00GGEVKYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  (Extended Edition) [HD</a>], playing the 2D version of the movie.

Using the defaults in the Nero Blu-ray player, I found the playback in full-screen mode to be a little choppy, like the PC couldn't quite keep up with the 20-25 Mbps data rate of the video. During the dragon attack scene in Chapter 1, I observed 14% CPU utilization and 310 MB of memory utilization. The same sequence in WinDVD was very smooth in playback, with 2% CPU and 355 MB of memory utilized.

The video playback options in the Nero product allow for Full Hardware (default), Partial Hardware, and Software decoding for the video. Changing to Partial Hardware resulted in a little smoother playback, with 16% CPU and 382 MB RAM utilization. Switching to Full Software mode improved the choppiness some more, but still not to the level of WinDVD, with 25% CPU and 410 MB of RAM being used.

There is a setting in the Audio options for directing audio to the SPDIF/HDMI output instead of the analog output on my motherboard. This raised my hopes, as I use a separate set of speakers for the default system sounds and other normal use, and for watching movies or playing music. Windows Media Player is one of the few programs which allows me to have select the SPDIF output for playback of music and DVD's, while still using the analog output as the default on the PC. With the Playback Device set to the analog output in Windows 7 and choosing the SPDIF/HDMI output option in Nero, I received an error dialog saying that there was a problem with the audio output device. Switching the default to the SPDIF output kept that error from occurring, so it is not possible to have Nero's Blu-ray playback software to act like Windows Media Player in that regard. (By comparison, WinDVD does not offer an option at all, so it only outputs to the default sound device.)

One last thing to bring up which impacts the usability of the Blu-ray player is that it will not play full-screen on my second monitor while allowing me to work normally on the primary monitor. I hadn't even considered that this would be an issue, as WinDVD has always worked that way, but this issue prevents sending the video to one monitor while working on another.

For this reason, as well as the others listed above, I cannot recommend using Nero Blu-ray Player for playing movies on Blu-ray. It's possible that this is a system-specific issue, but it is something to be aware of when considering this software.",Full featured product that does just about everything you could want for burning media,1392854400,,

The program is also available on-line at hdrsoft dot com, where you can get a free trial before buying.

This program is extremely easy to use, and once you've taken your three shots with auto-exposure bracketing, or more exposures at your choosing, you just click to upload them, and then follow the on screen choices.  A tripod is certainly necessary for good clean HDR images, but this software is so flexible that it will take your hand-held (slightly off) images, and align them, also fixing any ""ghosting"" from moving trees or shaky images. You can also use single images and apply tone-mapping, which also gives dynamic images.  Simple sliders allow you to tweak your images before saving them.

Your first tries will no doubt prove to be eye-openers, but keep in mind that the best images are the ones that are not ""overdone"" and totally fake looking.  Professionals use this program, and given its simplicity and affordability, so can you.

At first, we thought the H&R Block software was less buggy, and had less problems, although the user interface and interview portions are somewhat Spartan in their design.

Immediately after Efiling our 1040 return this evening, we noticed a glaring error in our HRB printed return.  The HRB software had calculated a lower refund that it should have - it opted to use the default option of the Itemized Deductions rather than the higher Standard Deduction, and our refund could have been $630 higher.  Put another way, nothing in the HRB software warned us to take the higher Standardized deduction and we missed the little check box as we passed through, and did not notice that the lower itemized deduction had been applied instead.

When I contacted HRB Support by phone this evening, they were apathetic, and did not seem to care about the problem I pointed out to them; about the obvious design flaw that should have been caught during the error check process at the end (as is the case with TurboTax by the way). I asked for the call to be escalated to a supervisor (Edwin) whose faux courtesy did little to soothe the pain that this is the first time EVER that we have had to file a 1040X Amended Return.  He REFUSED to ESCALATE my quality issue to the QC department and REFUSED to give me the contact number of the corporate office to report the problem we encountered, refused to have someone follow up by calling me tomorrow, and did not even provide a mailing address to write to the corporate office about an easy-to-fix problem, a problem that will cause us several extra hours of refiling the Amended 1040X return.  Also he refused to refund my purchase price or to honor their ""Maximum Refund Guarantee"" as detailed on their website.  Apparently, their guarantee is worthless, just pure marketing BS.

It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions. Windows 7 also includes a comprehensive device drivers, I have only had an issue with an old printer where Windows 7 could not find the drivers. But with Virtual XP this was no problem, I simply installed the Virtual XP, and used my printer within the virtualized environment. I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used.

-Comprehensive driver library
-Supports many devices out of the box
-Less annoying

Although the suite is large which is close to 2 GB, resource wise, it is ample and does not bog down your system, as the results of other resource hogging software. However, it does take a while when editing large GB files.

It does require seperate registrations for all 3 programs (PowerDirector / ColorDirector / SoundDirector) even though it is one package. I don't know why the set it up that way, but... oh well!

I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.

*Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.

*Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.

*Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.

*Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.

*A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.

*Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.","Pretty features, bad product. I would use iWork instead",1201737600,5,

I still love to play the games from the classic part of the series (games one through nine), and although this one definitely isn't the best of the first few games, there are still a few positive aspects in this one, you just have to look hard to find some of them.

Story: 8/10. This story is somewhat of a rarity for the Nancy Drew games, because it's pretty much two stories in one mystery: Ghoulish ghost dogs appear in the middle of the night and try to maul Sally McDonald's house (the house Nancy stays at in the game). There is also the theory that a man named Mickey Malone buried treasure somewhere on Sally's property, which used to be his land. I loved the idea of two stories, and these two melded together pretty well, and were pretty well done.

Graphics/Setting: 7/10. Since this game was released in late 2002, the graphics aren't going to be that amazing, but the setting was somewhat decent, as you got to explore a convenience store, a forest, a graveyard, a sheriff station and the actual house Nancy stays at.

Characters: 6.5/10. This game has one or two less suspects than usual Nancy Drew games (this one has 3 people that you meet in person), and they somewhat feel bland. You have Emily, the southern store owner, Red, the anthropic bird watcher, and Ranger Akers, the strict runner of the town who loves ticketing people. None of them are very colorful, and definitely aren't the highlight of this game.

Puzzles/Exploring: 5.5/10. They're aren't many puzzles in here as there are tasks, and one thing that forces me to knock down this game's score is that exploration feels practically nonexistent. They're really isn't anything to search or sleuth in besides a frustratingly big forest and the occaisonal passage. But the few puzzles that were there I could usually do without hints, which means that they were really simple.

Activities:5/10. Another thing that is pretty much nonexistent in this game. The only things that even come close to fun activities in this game are bird-watching and reading the lake's history on the Sheriff's computer. I would have like more plain fun to be added in this game.

Ending:
7.5/10. Some endings take a little bit of time to complete, and may even require a second chance, but this one is over very quickly, yet it somehow gives you that goosebumpy feeling that good Nancy Drew endings give you. I'm sure you know what I mean

Total (average): 6.58 out of 10, averaged to....

Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.

The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.","Great program, versatile, competitively priced",1213315200,2,

I was thrilled to be able to try out Cyberlink PowerDirector, as it has consistently been winning against Pinnacle in head-to-head testing.

At first glance, the two programs have very similar appearance and ease-of-use within their full-feature editors. I found Pinnacle to be slightly easier to understand as far as being able to import folders and keeping different photos in those folders while I'm working on a project, otherwise both are equal in creating a photo-montage production, which is what I use this type of program for the most.

Cyberlink makes it easier to move things around the timeline in groups, so you can select a batch of images and drag them wherever. Pinnacle made it easier to copy and paste transition actions, but I think I'm just missing out on a quicker way to do it with Cyberlink.

Where PowerDirector really shines though is the wonderful Easy Editor and Slideshow Creator options. Honestly, these are so quick and simple that I think anyone could easily use them and create a good-looking video without any training whatsoever.

Pinnacle had issues with VERY slow rendering before you could burn a DVD, PowerDirector was able to render the same project in about half the time. Pinnacle also had issues with crashing when you'd get too complex with a bunch of different transitions and special effects within a project, PowerDirector seems more stable, although I was able to get it to crash once while trying to un-do a very resource-heavy process.

And if you are non-serious about your photography/photo editing, I'm sure you will be quite happy with this program's features and capabilities. However, if you are a serious photographer that needs/wants an array of professional level tools that provide uncompromising, professional level results, you will almost certainly NOT be happy with this program's features and capabilities.

This is simply not by any stretch of the imagination a photo editing program for a serious photographer, and you need to understand that upfront. But, this program is priced accordingly.

The most infuriating thing about upgrading to this version is that it introduced literally dozens of categories into my data file without even asking me.  My categories ('accounts' in accounting parlance) have been in use satisfactorily for many years and I had no need for these crazy new ones that Quicken 2010 inserted:  ""Ads"", ""Car"" (I had ""Auto"" and subs), dozens of ""Biz"" entries, etc.  My memorized reports all ask me what to do about the new categories, they show up in lists, etc ... so I'm busy purging them all at the moment...

Readability of various screens and lists has decreased over earlier versions.  Problems with reports that have existing since the 1990's still exist.  Responsiveness of the application is ridiculously slow as you page or scroll through lists, delete categories, etc - as if none of it was natively programmed.  Old (really old) bugs still exist - such as scheduled transactions not picking up the proper amounts from memorized transactions the first time you enter the payee - have to switch to another payee then back to the intended one, possibly a few times.

Instead of fixing old problems, including speed (remember when Quicken was ""quick""?  I do.)...and report formatting (remember when subtotals were in a different column?, account names were not truncated?  There was space control under subtotals, and more?  Yeah - that was Quicken for DOS in 1990)  they introduced more garish charts, buttons, tabs etc that just complicate the user experience.

They still install (without asking) irritating advertising buttons on your desktop - and of course advertise for more paid services in the product.  Look, if they gave away the product, then they can shove advertising at me in return.  But, we all paid for this.  We should have an 'opt out' box on the installation screen saying ""No, I do not want to be presented with any icons, in-product offers, or e-mails for services from Intuit or any 3rd party.""

I've been really putting the program through its paces over the last month or so.

I am an experienced Photoshopper and Sketchbook Pro user and I really wasn't expecting to love Corel Painter as much as those two programs. And admittedly, Corel isn't quite as versatile as PS, though I think it is actually better for straight art/drawing/painting applications than PS and certainly better than SBP. So if you need an art program and not an art/rendering/photo editing program, this is your guy.

Corel Painter has some features that I absolutely can't live without. The perspective tool is invaluable for making renderings that look proportional (and I imagine super handy for artists) and the brush search tool is so nice. The Watercolor and Flow maps are, as far as I know, unique to CP and make amazing works of art. They help your image really go from digital to real-world.

I use a Mac and CP has a feature that adjust the memory usage of your computer to optimize your program use, which is so clever and works  perfect. Working in CP becomes quick. And CP is much more user friendly and intuitive than PS, perhaps in part due to the limited capabilities (compared to PS), but also because it is well designed. And if you just can't live without your PS, CP is actually compatible with PS and even share some plug-ins.

CP has a seemingly endless supply of brush, paper texture and media. I have no doubt I haven't even gotten to half of them.

My interest in MapPoint was focused entirely on mapping data so I could visualize where my employees live and work. Routing information, optimizing trips, and sending data to my GPS were not the reasons I got MapPoint. I looked at the GPS connection tool and walked away confused. (Hey MicroSoft! Why not take a page from Google's book and tell us what GPS units you can actually interface with?)

So my review is focused entirely on how easy it is to use MapPoint to map lots and lots of data into it. The answer: pretty dog gone easy! I took data from an Excel file and, in less than two minutes, had push pin maps of where my employees live throughout the country. This data is easily combined with, say, health plan provider data to show gaps in medical networks, or to identify concentrations of people in rural vs. urban areas.

Another Amazon reviewer took over 3200 words in a thorough product review to say he didn't like MapPoint - especially the map displays. One man's junk is another man's treasure. I thought the map displays were exquisite - there are many choices of colors to use, different methods to display data - and both on screen and in print, I had no trouble seeing the datapoints. Of course, when you are mapping hundreds of data elements in a tiny region, you may not be able to see all of them, but this is where MapPoint shines: you can select how you want volume data to be displayed, so that different colors denote different population samples.

But that said, how compelling is the information that MapPoint churns out of data? Of course, that depends on who is using it and for what purpose, but in my application, it produced interesting but not earth-shaking revelations. One thing that the 3200 word reviewer said that makes total sense is to download the trial version and use the heck out of it for 60 days before deciding.

Having played around with this product for the last several weeks it appears the mental block is still firmly lodged in place.

Flashback. When I first started really using computers in the late 1980s I had a tremendously difficult time understanding the concept of the ""root directory."" When I started dabbling with the Apple OS in the early 1990s I had a similar problem understanding the concept of the ""alias."" Looking back I'm amazed at how difficult I found what now seems to be such simple and straight-forward concepts. But then, ugh!

Sad to say, then, that I am utterly unqualified to provide any real insight. But that might be the best thing I can contribute to the review database: there seems to be a steep learning curve, but if one perseveres the gains are sure to be there.

All these machines serve different functions -- one is for your business, one might be for storing digital pictures and the kids may use theirs for playing games.  They are all different and even though they reside under the same roof it is next to impossible to share files with them all and when it comes to backup -- well, just ask yourself this, when is the last time you backed any of them up?  You are a digital home but a connected home you are not.

Enter Microsoft's newest product, Windows Home Server.  A revolutionary product that offers consumers centralized storage and backups in their households with a product that you plug in and literally let it run without any intervention on your part.

Windows Home Server makes the concept of a connected home a reality in a simple, easy to use package that will bring your entire digital family together in one place.  Imagine never having to worry about backups again because they are taken automatically, every night, while you sleep.  Think of how easy it would be to share digital pictures, movies and files with your family without having to e-mail them or put them on USB fobs that always seem to get lost.  What if you could check to make sure your kids have their anti-virus protection running without having to check their computer manually?  How about never having to worry about your precious family photos, home videos and important documents getting lost because of a computer crash thanks to data redundancy?

If these sound like your idea of a dream, then dream no more.  All these features and more await you in Windows Home Server.

The idea is simple.  Put a machine (doesn't have to be too powerful) in an out of the way location in the house.  It doesn't need a keyboard or a mouse, just hard drives.  But wait, even the hard drives don't have to be all the same or fit inside the box.  You can hook up any combination of hard disks you want -- from internal to external USB and firewire drives.  Windows Home Server manages them for you, creating one big pool of disk space that is duplicated across the drives -- so if one fails, you don't lose one byte of data!

Backups are a breeze as well; every night Windows Home Server backups up files from all the connected PC's and stores them on the server.  However, it doesn't just back up files -- it intelligently decides which files are different, and which aren't and doesn't backup duplicates.  So if everyone in your house has Microsoft Word installed, it won't create 5 backup copies of it.  Just one copy which all 5 computers can restore from!

Traveling and need access to your Powerpoint presentation or important document?  Fire up a web browser and securely access any file stored on the server!  Better yet, remote connect to any computer in your household running Windows Vista or XP and use it as if you were sitting right in front of it.  All from a secure web browser!

One more thing for all you XBOX 360 owners out there, or those of you who have digital picture frames that are network-aware -- Windows Home Server has the ability to stream content to your XBOX 360 and to your digital picture frames!  Functionality ""out of the box"", which will no doubt be extended further as third party applications start to appear thanks to the Windows Home Server Software Development Kit (SDK) that Microsoft has released for WHS.

In Windows Home Server Microsoft has created a product (based off of Windows 2003 Server) that any household can use and enjoy without having to worrying about ""IT Support"".  The product just simply works, and needs almost zero maintenance.

To be honest, I totally despised it at first. Without the ""Start"" button, trying to learn a new user interface was very frustrating. It took time, and I got used to it. Still though, I thought the Metro UI was very awkward on non-touchscreen hardware. Why Microsoft decided to not give users the option to have the Start button, and use the ""Classic UI"" desktop if desired, is beyond me. What turned me around was the 3rd party applications that give you back the Start button and Desktop. I've been using a free program called ""Classic Shell"" which allows me to run Windows 8 in a hybrid mode where I have both the Metro UI, and classic Windows Desktop with Start Button. With 1 click of the mouse, I can switch back and forth. I highly recommend it if you find the new Windows 8 Metro UI frustrating.

OK, on to my upgrade experience. I decided to upgrade my old, modest dual-core, Windows 7 desktop. I downloaded the ""Windows 8 Upgrade Advisor"" from Microsoft and let it analyze my system. After about 5 minutes, it told me what was compatible, what wasn't, and my installation options. It offered the special limited time $40 upgrade, which I took advantage of. The download was about 2GB, and took about 5 minutes on my fast internet connection. Once downloaded, I decided to upgrade my current Windows 7 installation instead of starting from scratch. This is probably only a good idea if you're sure your current version of Windows is running well, as any issues could be imported into Windows 8. The installation process took a little longer than an hour, which I thought was a little long. When it finished, Windows 8 booted up and I was up and running Windows 8. I only had 1 issue. The installation nuked my Norton Anti-Virus 2012. Despite being supposedly compatible, the program would no longer run. I also couldn't get it to uninstall normally. The ""Norton Removal Tool"" was no help either, as it just hangs up when run. I'm not too concerned. For now, I'm using Windows 8 new built in security suite, ""Defender"". Once I sorted that out, all my programs seem to run fine. As stated earlier, I installed ""Classic Shell"", and enjoy running the Metro UI and classic Windows Desktop at the same time. I ran ""Windows Update"" and there were several large Windows 8 updates already available. The download was over 1GB, but installed quickly. Windows 7 ran very well on this old system, and Windows 8 does too. I'm not seeing any real differences in boot times, etc. I'm getting more and more used to Metro, which I guess eventually we'll all have to since this is the road Microsoft chose to take. All in all, at the low special upgrade price, I'm happy with Windows 8. With the 3rd party application giving me the choice which mode to run in, I have the best of Windows 7 and Windows 8 running on my system. To the person with little experience with Windows 8, do some homework and have a lot of patience. It's a whole new experience from Windows 7. Some will love it, and some will hate it. Luckily there are tools out there that allow you to have the choice how the OS looks and runs.

Anyhow, Acronis 2011 is very easy to use, it's super easy to make a boot disk and I can back up over my network.  The boot disk worked well on multiple pc's for booting them to the network.  It was a decent product, for the most part.

The primary issue I have (which Acronis still has not fixed even with 2013) is that when you do a RESTORE, even if you use Disk Signatures and restore them too... Acronis just can't figure out how to keep the machine joined to a domain!

When you do a FULL backup of a DISK... it's supposed to be a full, exact copy.

Acronis does not do that.  They are not exact backups.  IF they were, I would not continue to have this issue.

Just this weekend I did a restore of an image that is only 6 months old.  I restored to a new HD as I was going to upgrade to Windows 8.  Once again, as expected, Acronis did dropped my machine off of my network.  So I had to join the domain again and as mentioned... when you have to set up all emails profiles, all software, all everything... one may as well do a clean reinstall of everything.

Acronis again recommends to use their ""workstation"" version of their software, which is far more expensive and it's the same thing.

The products tend to fail you when you need them most.  Support is less than stellar.

What I find ironic is that every year... I buy an updated copy for I keep hoping and waiting that the day will come that they once again put out a quality product, as they did way back in the beginning.

Even with version 2013... I'm still waiting and as I do so, I continue to look at other backup solutions.

Acronis 2013... it's a lot like 2011 but seems to be less buggy, so I would recommend this if other decent alternatives can't be found and again, if you are not on a domain.

One thing I did like... I installed this on my primary PC (windows 7 machine).  Later, I upgraded my laptop to Windows 8 and found that NONE of the previous versions of Acronis were compatible.  They would not even install.  So I installed Acronis 2013.  When I went to register it... I got a warning and message that it was already registered and it showed me where.  But, unlike previous versions, I was asked if I wanted to move the license from that other machine to this one.  That I liked a lot.  It was a convenient feature vs. making me contact support or go have to log into some account somewhere and make changes.

IT too though, won't do a restore of a full disk accurately...

Sooner or later, a colleague will send you a spreadsheet with some sort of custom macro that only works in Excel, or a presentation that only seems to render properly in authentic PowerPoint. Even if you're a diehard Mac user with all sorts of sophisticated alternate apps on your Mac, sooner or later you'll wish you had Microsoft Office.

The good news is that Microsoft has made it really easy to get Office, and to share both the apps and your documents across a wide range of devices, not just your Mac. On my iPad, for example, I use Office 365...gone are the days of saving presentations as PDFs so that I can display them from my iPad since the built-in PPT viewer doesn't quite display complex slides correctly. Create the PPT on my Mac, save it in One Drive (or even Dropbox), and there it is on all my devices at the same time.

There are lots of choices about how to get Office. This product - the key card - is somewhat more traditional...you download the software and install it using the serial number on your key. It's a big download, but if you have a fast Internet connection, the whole thing only takes a few minutes.  If you use Office on multiple devices, you might want to compare the key card approach to an Office 365 subscription...in my case, I have two mobile devices, three Macs and a Windows computer - one license of Office 365 covers all that, plus ongoing upgrades, way less expensively than buying individual keys for each system.

However you get it, Office 2016 is definitely the best Office yet, but it has no huge surprises in terms of functionality. The overall look is fresh and updated, but still familiar to anyone who has used Office in the past. The apps are large and can be slow on older, marginal computers, but they tend to run really well on the latest hardware. If you're a guru at using obscure Word features, you'll find that they all work pretty much the same way, and documents you created years ago still view and print correctly.

Norton 360 seems, in general, to get mediocre reviews in the press as well as from a major consumer publication that I read routinely. As a consumer, I don't have access to--for instance--the kind of virus-catching software that professionals use to test the effectiveness of anti-virus packages. As a result, my review can only really address general performance, the user interface, and convenience.

General Performance. Norton 360 seems fine. It doesn't noticeably slow down my system. I haven't gotten any virus warnings, or in fact ANY kind of warnings. So I can only conclude that the software is either seamlessly protecting me, that no threats are being encountered, or that I'm being infected with all kinds of viruses and other on-line threats. Given the lack of symptoms of any problems and my history of good experiences with Symantec products, I assume all is well.

User Interface. The UI is simple and intuitive, perfect for people (like me) who just want peace of mind without a lot of fiddling. There's an icon in the system tray with a green check, which tells me that all is well. When it changes to a red exclamation point, I know I have to do something, and the interface for correcting the problems is simple. There are four areas of protection: PC Security, Identity Protection, Backup, and PC Tuneup. Each area has a simple and intuitive menu that appears when you hover the mouse pointer over the corresponding icon.

Convenience. For me, it's perfect. Virtually all functions are scheduled and/or occur automatically. Unlike a Trend Micro product I used before, the system doesn't constantly present me with issues and ask me what I want to do about them.

After over a month, I've had no problems. However, given what I've read about Norton 360's performance on catching viruses (on a consumer web-site I trust), I can't in good conscience give this product five stars.","So far, so good",1214784000,2,

Software installed easily and quickly using an external DVD drive.  The computer recognized the GPS unit, however it could not find any satellites (in comparison the Garmin sitting next to it was finding 10 satellites).

I contacted Microsoft and through remote access the tech did the following. I asked him to send it in an email to me so I could provide it here.

Following are the steps we did

Step 1: Click on START and then click on RUN. In the RUN box, type MSCONFIG and click on OK.

Step 2: Under System Configuration, click on Selective Startup, and uncheck the following items...

Process System.ini file
Process Win.ini file
Load Startup Items

Then click on the tab SERVICES and check the option - Hide all Microsoft Services. Then click on DISABLE ALL and the click on APPLY and CLOSE.

When prompted to, restart the PC and try Streets and Trips with the GPS, it should work. Once it Starts working, repeat Step 1 above, and then switch back to Normal Startup, apply that change and click on CLOSE. That will get the computer back to normal. Now, try Streets and Trips with the GPS again, and it should be working, with the PC in normal mode.

********

Once this was done the GPS did pick up satellites.  However, when actually using it on the road the connection was dropped and picked up once every few minutes, then every time it would pick it up it would recalculate the trip again.  After speaking again to the tech he told me that it might be that the USB ports are not powered enough.  He got this information from another tech and sounded unsure about it.  I myself do not know if this is true.  Perhaps someone who does can comment on it.  I learned also from the tech that there are two different GPS units provided with this software.  I got a Navation GPS 168 with mine.
 The software is great and intuitive.  My 13 year old son quickly figured out how to use it.  Great for finding restaurants, gas stations ect. You do need someone else to run it, it would be dangerous to be making adjustments while driving yourself.
I am giving it 3 stars,  five stars for the software and one for the GPS receiver to average 3 overall.  The only downside I have found to the software is that sometimes it knows the street name (displays it on the map) but still calls it a ""local road"" when speaking directions.  I think it should work with a netbook, or if it does not they should tell you so in the description.  Tech support was very helpful and even called me back to see if it was still working a few days later.

****UPDATE

We bought a longer USB cord for the GPS so it could be right up in the windshield and now it works much better.  The cord supplied did not have a very tight connection and the short length made it hard to get it near a window.  I am upgrading it to two stars, since now it works pretty well but Microsoft should have sprung for a slightly better USB cord that holds the GPS securely and reaches far enough to go into the window.","Five stars for software, two stars for GPS.

Aside from the fact that the add is grossly unfair (considering Apple released quite a few OS during the same years as Windows, and none of them were perfect either), the add has a point: some Windows versions have been inferior or even downright terrible (ME for example). That said, Windows 7 is a great OS, really a dramatic improvement in many ways, and should not be ignored. The short answer is you should absolutely upgrade from either XP or Vista. The longer answer is still a yes, but that you need to understand what you're buying and how you can use it first.

I think much of the confusion about this version of Windows 7 surrounds the title 'upgrade.' Many have taken 'upgrade' to mean that one can seamlessly move from XP or Vista without having to reinstall anything. This is not always the case depending on what OS you are upgrading from. Here 'upgrade' means that you are 'upgrading' from one OS to another. The retail versions are being sold for systems that have no OS in place at all--for example a new system build. I agree that Microsoft (and Amazon for that matter) could and should have been explicit about this--unfortunately they were not, and that's left a sour taste in the mouths of many, which I totally understand. Adding to the confusion is that you can seamlessly upgrade from Vista Home Premium with this version, but NOT Visa Professional, NOR Vista Ultimate. Microsoft did not do a good job of making the seamless upgrade paths clear, so here they are:

If you are upgrading from XP (any version) you MUST do a clean install of Windows 7. No seamless upgrade route is available. However, you CAN do a dual boot installation that will allow you to keep XP and run it in tandem with Windows 7. This is a great route if you have programs that may not run on Windows 7 (I've yet to find one myself--everything I have runs perfectly).
If you have XP, you should do a clean install. Even if it is time consuming, it bears a multitude of benefits for you and your computer in the long run. If you're dead set on upgrading from XP and keeping your programs, you could try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laplink-Windows-7-Upgrade-Assistant/dp/B002TOL9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laplink Windows 7 Upgrade Assistant</a>&nbsp;but I would NOT recommend it.

If you are upgrading from Vista, here is what you need for a seamless upgraded:

Vista Home Premium:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLUWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade</a>

Keep in mind that you MUST install the same system type (32-bit or 64-bit) as your current version of Vista to have a seamless upgrade route available! You cannot upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit system and keep your programs (well actually you can keep some of them, but more on that later). Since you are provided both 32-bit and 64-bit installation disks, you can choose which version you want to run. If you have newer hardware, 64-bit is probably the way to go as it is faster and will allow you to take advantage of more than 3.5gb of system RAM.

The silliest part of the upgrade scheme is that you CANNOT do a downgrade 'upgrade.' In other words, you cannot downgrade from Visa Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional through the seamless route! This defies logic and explanation from Microsoft, and is the reason I've knocked a star off an otherwise nearly perfect OS.

Personally I did a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit over a Vista 64-bit system (I chose the clean install method because I believe it represents the best route to a trouble free and 'clean' feeling system). I installed over my old Windows directory (which I had backed up by creating a disk image using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Acronis-True-Image-Home/dp/B001DSGXFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Acronis True Image Home</a>&nbsp;just in case anything went wrong. Installation took about 30 minutes, actually much faster than any other OS install I've ever done. All of my hardware was recognized and drivers were installed without a hitch. The old windows files are moved to a windows.old file which contains all of your user accounts, program files, and old Windows files. It is possible to open the programs file (in windows.old) and copy over many programs into your new programs file and some of them will work perfectly fine. I was able to do with with all my web browsers, a few computer games, and some random applications. Not EVERYTHING will work, but many will and it's worth at least testing it out.

I've since upgraded several other computers (my wife's laptop, a few computers at work). My wife's was a simple streamline upgrade from vista home to Windows 7 home (32-bit to 32-bit). It took a bit longer, probably about an hour, but managed to keep all programs and settings from Vista. The others were clean install upgrades. The only one that I had an issue with was upgrading a 32-bit system to a 64-bit system. I installed to a different hard drive and booted up to W7 just fine. However, I could not delete the old windows files from the previous installation. I followed various Googled help pages on taking ownership of files, etc., but was unable to get all the files to delete no matter what I did. Ultimately I was forced to physically remove the hard drive, put it into an enclosure, and delete the files using a separate computer. The UAC (User Account Control) system that prevents system files from being deleted was in this case out of control and impossible to overcome--even for an middle-advanced computer user who knows how to troubleshoot/problem solve using online resources. For someone with less experience, it would have been even more frustrating I am sure.

Many others have gone into great detail about the feature set of Windows 7 and the various improvements from Vista, so I will not spend much time running through all of them again. Suffice it to say that Aero works wonderfully, QuickSnap is amazing, especially on a larger monitor, and that all of the visual tweaks are nicely done and very welcome. The reorganization of the start menu is wonderful and makes the W7 task bar nearly perfect. Add a simple dock program to the mix like RocketDock (google it) and this OS is hands down better than even Snow Leopard--which is pretty awesome.

Performance is also great. My boot time went from 1:47 to :56! Nearly a minute faster! (Hardware: E8500, P45 Asus Striker MB, 8GB ram, Hd4870 x2 in crossfire). Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use. Everything Vista wasn't, W7 is.

I'm very pleased with W7, and aside from some miserable communication from Microsoft about what upgrade means and what can upgrade to what, it's nearly flawless. If you want a stable, fast, visually appealing and advances OS, W7 will not disappoint. Just make sure you know what you're buying so that you don't end up dissatisfied.

Thankfully, I only have to deal with this piece of garbage at work.  I definetely will NOT be buying ANY XP branded product for my home computer.
First of all if you thought Word was slow, wait until you try Word XP. It takes nearly 5 minutes for a large document to load in Word XP while Word brought it up in a few seconds.  And when word finally does load your document, it has stupid comments all over your document (which is probally why it took so long to load).  The first time I tried printing a document with Word XP, it took nearly 90 minutes for it to even get to the printer!  When the document FINALLY printed out, I found that it printed out ALL the comments which DOUBLED the size of my document.  I figured out how to turn the comments off, but have not figured out how to turn it off permantly.  So everytime I load a document, I have to turn the comments off and hope that the drop downs that do this actually work!
Also when I first loaded word, outlook or excel there was this annoying ""pop up"" at the top corner of your screen that had something to do with hands free typing.  I permantly killed this window too because I DON'T NEED THIS [stuff] MICROSOFT!!
Also another feature I don't like is when you copy more that one item in word, it brings up another annoying clipboard window that Microsoft assumes you want.  This window displays EVERYTHING you have copied and covers up part of the window you are working in.  I never have and never will use this clipboard so there is no reason why it should keep popping up.  Apparantly Microsft ""forgot"" to add a way to permantely turn this off from office.  I ended up having to go into the Windows registry to do it.
Finally there are bugs galore.  The buttons and drop downs sometimes stop working for no apparant reason.  Sometimes when trying to open certain documents from other office programs you get error messages, and when trying to open Help, you occasionally get messages saying ""Error opening help""! Go figure.
Top these errors off with the ever annoying autoformatting ""feature"" in Word, Excel and Office and you have a complete waste of money.
Bottom line, Don't waste your money on this.  You are MUCH better off with what you have now.  I have discovered, that Microsoft tries to FORCE you to do things the way they ASSUME you like to do things.  They just keep adding more ""features"" that intefere more than assist you.  You will spend a lot of time undoing what they force you to do.  You will also spend a lot of time trying to turn off their useless and annoying ""features"" just to type ONE document.

I had purchased it, tried it and shelved it. I took it off the shelf after someone challenged me to try working with it and to review it again. Well, not much has improved in my thinking. A few things are a little more convenient (after you get accustomed to them) but overall the program is a drag on time consumption and ease for writers (authors). The 'ribbon' is okay, but it takes up room so in the end I dump it (hide it) and work without it until I need to use it. I convert books to eBooks and at that time the Ribbon is okay, but not more efficient than Microsoft 2000, actually making hyperlinks in 2000 within a document or to the Net is a ton easier in MS Word 2000 than in this version. For some reason Microsoft must have felt that hyperlinks should be made as difficult as Adobe makes them in InDesign. MS Word 2010 provides a neat image compression button for Web use and eBook use but does not resize them, so in the end I use Photoshop for that. BTW, you can resize the image for your local printer, but that does not resize it for the Web or eReaders. IMHO, 2010 is better than 2007 but fails to improve on Word 2000 and is therefore, just another change for marketing purposes and not necessarily for those who need to create material. I have Microsoft Office 2000, Word 2003 and Word 2007. I dumped 2003 and 2007 (uninstalled them) and now use MS 2000 for the bulk of my work. I have kept MS Word 2010 installed, but find that I don't gravitate to it, simply because my time is too valuable to put up with the geeky stuff.

Edit December 19, 2012: I have now had MSWord 2010 for about 8 months. For writing copy, books, etc. I still prefer MS 2000. For making eBook files for others I use the MSWord 2010. A few updates have helped with hyperlinks, but that's about it. The picture compression is handy for making eReaders like Kindles, Nooks, and other EPUB and iBook files. MS 2010 does open all older files and you can save them in the older version format if you need to. But I confirm again that MS 2010 costs too much labor time to switch copy writing or the writing of books and other large documents from 2000 to 2010.",Please MS Stop With The Gimmickry,1335139200,6,

I spent at least 40 minutes training it the first session, then I did additional trainings and it never was quite right. The commands seemed hard to implement on the fly. I figured that version 11--and the Home version at that--wouldn't be that much improvement.

I was so wrong. It feels like a completely different process than my first try. I installed the program, clicked on a few settings, and did a quick medium difficulty reading (JFK's Inaugural Speech) to train the software. I happen to have a slight Boston area accent, but it's not as strong as JFK's. That was it. I thought I totally missed something. That was the training?

I decided to test it on a fiction story I'm writing by dictating instead of my normal typing. I have to say, I am really impressed. It's like a totally new experience. I did 1500 words in half the time it takes me to type. I had to fix a couple blatant mistakes; I left a couple small errors to fix later (my typing usually has more errors). I used the ""dialogue box"" to redo a homonym several times.

*Go to next line or paragraph, no problem.

No errors, and everything launched fine afterwards.  It prompts you to register at that point, which enables support for that serial number.  They didn't specify, but they made it sound from the message there that if you don't register, you wouldn't be able to get support, which is a bit annoying if it activated...

It puts a shortcut on the desktop for training from Studio Backlot.  It seems they have a program for Pinnacle Studio support to include video as well as standard training materials.  The downside here is you get an all access pass for only 21 days...  So better study up, there is a LOT of things to learn here.

I've been using Pinnacle Studio as far back as I can remember, through their multiple ownership changes.  I've never gotten too deep into the magic it can do, I was just doing things like making DVD's and such of home movies of my kid or other family things.

So I've dealt with creating the various DVD menus, scene transitions and wipes, adding titles, trimming scenes and repositioning them.  Nothing intense, but all I really needed to do.  So I know I'm just a tyro when it comes to the program, and I only barely scratch the surface.

But I like how, as each version is released, some things are added that are simply more intuitive.  For example, having imported a movie (I've tested with MKV, MPG, and MP4 so far) when you're looking at the window with the timeline, you can grab the timeline and compress it so the whole movie's timeline fits in the window you're working in, or drag it to the right and stretch it all out so you can get more granular control over the timeline and adding markers and cutting/pasting and editing.

It's easy to add multiple tracks, and pick which one's audio is played, but for some reason that I haven't figured out yet, it won't produce sound with an MKV.  It's not a codec issue on the computer, since MKV's play fine with other programs on here, including sound.  But within the program, there may as well not be an audio track.

And oddly enough, this version isn't letting me select a blu ray format as my end goal. Now I don't have a blu ray writer, which may be why, but I would've hoped it at least would've let me do that format on this PC as an image that I could later burn onto a blu ray disc elsewhere...  So apparently the Ultimate version, at least here, doesn't seem to support creating a blu ray format product.

Wipes look like they should be pretty easy as well, when you've added a portion (or entirety) of a video source to a project, and it shows up in whichever track you dragged it to, you can grab a corner and ""peel"" for a wipe.  You can right click it and select what kind of transition you want to do, but here's where I'm going to have to delve into the 21 days of training, since when I did that, the resulting change from one video track to the other never actually did any wiping effect or transitions, it was an abrupt, stark switch from video 1 to video 2 or 3.

It also supports 360 videos, and has some options and settings for it, but as I don't have anything that supports creating them yet, I couldn't test.

I like the insertion options though, to have a small picture in picture (or more than one) which is awesome for people with go pros and such to have the two streams, their view of what they're doing, and the view of their face that so many enjoy having as well.

The bottom line is that there's more power here than I'll ever use, but that is good, since it means the less ""pro"" level people, someone with a new baby for example who wants to start making home movies, will be able to get in here and do some really cool things, while still having the ability for the high end videophile to go beyond what the rest of us ""mere mortals"" would do.

I had a harrowing experience with the program including software bugs and crashes, inadequate interface, missing schedules, and a nightmare with deduction pro.  To top it all off customer support was virtually non-existant.  When I did get through they were unable to help me.

When I received a free copy of TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal in the mail with 'Free! We want you back"" blazoned on the CD jacket, I was leary but then thought, 'what the heck. It's free, I'll try it.'

PROS:
1. Competent tax programt that has come a long way--now comparable with
TurboTax (in the past this was not the case)
2. Reasonable interface
3. Reasonably priced
4. Federal forms worked smoothly
5. INCREDIBLE customer support via webchat; BETTER than TurboTax
6. Much improved DeductionPro
7. Easy e-file

CONS:
1. I think TurboTax still has the edge...
2 Poor integration with state forms
3. So-so interview for state forms
4. Poor help files for state forms
5. DeductionPro not as easy to use for non-monetary donations/deductions as TurboTax's It'sDeductable
6. Key codes needed for e-filing weren't included in my version.  They were easy to obtain from customer support, but this was an unnecessary annoyance.

So try it, I did and I was pleasantly surprised. I am comparing this to last year's experience with TurboTax, as I was satisfied with TaxCut and went with it.  On the whole, the Federal tax experience is excellent, however, the state tax experience was less smooth.  (See below)

Bear in mind that I do not have an overly difficult return to file.  No major investments and not very complicated itemized deductions.  I did move this year so I had two state forms to fill out and did sell and buy a house.  Other than this, pretty simple and standard.  I completed the taxes on an iMac, so this may be somewhat different than the Windows version.

THE INTERFACE:  For starters, my TurboTax information from last year imported with out a hitch.  The questions were simple and to the point. There are fewer fill-ins per screen than in last year's TaxCut.  My guess is that it took a little longer than last year, but that may have had to do with the increased complexity of my taxes.  One caveat here is that you have to answer the questions carefully, as missing one will result in missing one part of your tax.  In comparison with TurboTax, TaxCut's interview questions are a little less clear.  Double checking and knowing your finances does solve most problems, but care must be taken to make sure you don't miss a schedule or a life event.  On the whole this was easy, but I'd give a slight edge to TurboTax here.

On the whole, the feature sets are similar between programs.  I would have to say, that TurboTax is somewhat slicker.  TurboTax allows you to download some W-2s electronically--I did not see that option in TaxCut.  TurboTax has better integration between help files and the interview and also allows for easier navigation between sections on the tax forms.  But TaxCut is no slouch and was adequate to the task.

DEDUCTION PRO:  This is gobs better than TaxCut 2005.  I like the fact that the program is installed on your computer, making it more responsive than the TurboTax equivalent.  (It'sDeductable!, from TurboTax, is an online program.)  It was easy to input various charities and non-monetary donations.  DeductionPro has a 'calculator' for non-monetary donations, but once you calculate the value you have to manually input it into DeductionPro.  The TurboTax version allows you to calculate the value and then directly inputs it into the spreadsheet--a much smoother operation.  Unlike my past experience with DeductionPro, the deductions were quickly and easily imported into TaxCut.  If you revise your deductions and reimport the file, TaxCut now has a failsafe to prevent you from deducting the same things twice.  Much better than 2005.  If you have a lot of non-monetary deductions, TurboTax would win the competition.  If you have mostly monetary deductions, TaxCut's interface is better and, given that the program runs on your computer, there is no need for passwords and no time lags that can happen on web-based programs.

FINAL AUDIT:  Both programs seem to have reasonable audit features and bring you to the area of the forms where there are questions or problems.  No difference here.

E-FILING: There are 5 free e-files on TaxCut and the process went without a hitch.  Both programs work well in this respect

CUSTOMER SUPPORT/PROBLEMS:  I had to contact customer support 3 times with TaxCut.  Each time, I used their webchat interface.  My longest wait for an customer service rep was 10 minutes.  Each time, the customer service rep was courteous, helpful, and solved my problem.  This is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what occurred in 2005 when customer service was virtually non-existant and unable to help.

Problems included:
1. The need for a Key Code in order to e-file.  Key codes were not included with my program (unclear why).  I needed a keycode for both the federal form and the state forms.  These were supplied by the customer service rep.
2. Inability to remove an inappropriate schedule from a state form.  I was walked through this with a service rep
3. The CD I received did not have DeductionPro bundled with it.  Customer service gave me a download link for the program.  (This may be a glitch in the Apple/OSX version of the program)

Each time help came quickly and easily.  TaxCut gets 5 stars for live 24 hour help.  Last year's TurboTax help was okay, but nothing to write home about...

STATE FORMS:  This is where TaxCut takes a bit of a dive.  Based on my experience with the Federal forms, I bought and downloaded the state forms.  All I needed were the key codes (as noted above) which were absent after the download.  These weren't sent via email, but I knew about this when I requested the codes for the federal forms and received the key codes for the state at the same time.

The state forms are less well integrated with the federal forms than I remember from TurboTax.  I never had to complete two forms with TurboTax.  Suffice it to say, the NJ form was easier than the PA form (which is strange because PA is a flat percentage of your income).  The state forms did not integrate with each other at all.

The PA and NJ forms did import information from the federal forms and W-2s, but did not take the information about my move from the beginning of the TaxCut interview.  I had to input this information into the state forms and actually had to do this separately for each state as the state forms do not integrate with each other.  The same was true for salary collected from one state while my primary residence was in the other.  I had to input redundant information into the program.  It's hard for me to compare this with TurboTax as I had only used TurboTax with a single state before.

The state forms did not have thorough interviews.  Some information had to be typed directly into the forms themselves.  Not specifically a problem, but in the tax software business, the interface is the most important thing.

Finally, the state help files were not as thorough.  Especially for PA, I found myself downloading files from the PA state site in order to review instructions for filling out the tax forms--a major glitch in the TurboTax state forms.

One major problem:  the PA form imported the sale of my home from the federal taxes.  The problem is, sale of a primary residence is not taxable in PA unless some part of the home is used for commercial purposes (or a few other exceptions).  After researching the instructions and downloading PDFs of the PA forms from PA state, I realized that this was the case.  Needless to say, TaxCut calculated a massive underpayment and I was unable to delete scheudule D without consulting customer service.  (As it turns out, I had to delete the schedule D 'worksheet' and then delete the forms.  If you try to delete the forms themselves, nothing happens...)

SUMMARY:  On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised with TaxCut.  Would I use it again?  I suppose I would.  TaxCut was a bit more rough around the edges to use than TurboTax, but beat TurboTax hands down with their customer support.  I would say that these programs are both good ways to do taxes.

On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised by TaxCut this year.  Would I have used it if I hadn't received the federal form free? Probably not.  But I will have to think about whether I will stick with TaxCut next year and the program was good enough to get me thinking.","A solid program to do taxes.

The only problem is that the bugs in this first release are so annoying and problematic that I've wasted more time trying to work out the kinks than being productive.  Going from the stability of Tiger to this has been a huge dissapointment.

My advice is to hold off a bit until they get some of these issues worked out.  Here are a list of the problems I am experiencing on both my Mac Pro and Macbook (other Mac owners are reporting similar problems on their machines):

1.  Desktop freezing - both machines frequently have their desktops freeze up, making them inaccessible.  The solution is to change the screen resolution to a lower setting and back.  **Since the 10.5.1 update I have not experienced additional desktop freezing issues**

2.  Installation woes - Leopard's upgrade disc did not recognize my Mac Pro's system drive initially, I had to run one of the programs on the installation disc in order to get it to pop up for the install.

3.  Font problems - If you do a lot of graphic design work and are continually receiving fonts along with a Quark or Adobe inDesign document, definitely hold off on upgrading.  A few current projects that opened up fine in Tiger simply don't recognize the fonts under Leopard.

4.  Back to My Mac - This for me was I upgraded.. Sadly it just doesn't work and likely won't for most of us. Checking through online discussion boards many other folks are equally frustrated in trying to get this thing to work.  Apple has recently posted a message indicating that expanded support for third party routers is ""coming soon.""  Huge oversight to be hyping a feature that will only work for those with a $180 Apple router.  Similar PC products like Hamachi work flawlessly, there's simply no excuse for this.  *** Since the 10.5.1 update Back to My Mac is working MUCH better, including a recent stay at a hotel. I'd say a bulk of the problems described above have been fixed.**

5.  Spaces - this great virtual desktop application is plagued by sucking applications into 'limbo' and occasionally cycles through the available desktops randomly when some apps display warnings.

6. Video glitches - The display on my Mac Pro (running an ATI x1900XT) often gets lines of gibberish streaking through the display.  Others are reporting similar issues.  **UPDATE:  Leopard taxes video hardware significantly more than prior releases of OS X.  X1900XT cards on the Mac Pro are experiencing an issue with dust building up on the heat sink which is blocking airflow and overheating the card.  Vacuuming out the heat sink has improved the problem for me.

7.  The new ""Dock"" is horrid..  The 3D ""glass"" effect makes it difficult to see which applications are currently loaded.  Thankfully a simple terminal command can remove the fancy effects and make it a bit more manageable.

8.  Time Machine works as advertised with an external drive attached to a USB or firewire port.  Getting it to work over a network with a Macbook is another story..  It will recognize internal drives on a networked machine, but external drives attached to that same networked computer are hit or miss.

Are any of these show stoppers?  With the exception of the font issue, probably not.  But if your system is running reliably with Tiger, I'd hold off a bit until Apple gets some of these issues worked out and releases their first round of updates.

Clearly the development team struggled getting this out the door, and it shows.  Definitely the most disappointing Apple product I've purchased in quite some time.",Wait for the First Update **UPDATED** 11-19,1193616000,143,

But about three years ago I finally gave norton a try and I will never look back.

I have stuck with the program because it works and works well, and with each new release it works even better.  For those who use Norton Antivirus 2003, there is little difference in the program, and perhaps the primary reason to move the newer version is the renewed subscription you will receive; the interface is the same.  Rather than radically changing the program from year to year, Symantec has made little improvements which enhance overall performance.  The results have been the consistency of a program that does the job of stopping viruses and does it well.
Installation:
Installation of Norton Antivirus 2004 is as straight forward as it is easy.  Barring any gaffes, the program will install and then ask you to register with Symantec which I recommend since this will setup the virus signature subscription program which lasts a year.
Technical Note: A virus signature is a file which contains information the antivirus program needs to defeat viruses and clean infected files.  Without updated signature files the anti-virus program would soon become outdated.  Symantec, through Live Update, continually downloads new signature files to Norton Antivirus 2004 via a subscription service which is part of the program.  However, the service lasts only a year and must be renewed-for a fee of course.
Users-like me-who also use Norton Internet Security 2003 (which shipped with Norton Antivirus 2003), will find that the program also interoperates with Norton Antivirus 2004.  During the installation process the older version will be removed and Norton Antivirus 2004 will be integrated with Internet Security 2003.
As is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be ""activated"" either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working.
Upon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.

First Impressions:
I am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program.
The sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways:
* Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.

* Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off.
* Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off.
I utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack.
Virus Scanning:
Norton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following:
* My Computer
* Scan all removable drives
* Scan all floppy disks
* Scan drives
* Scan folder
* Scan files
Custom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me!
Conclusion:
Virus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.",There When You Need It!,1069027200,11,

I can't say that it has fixed anything, but it isn't causing any conflicts or lag time in any of the machines, which is a huge plus. I can say that it did seem to take quite a bit of time to install-more time then I would prefer-but I guess that is probably a good sign that it is installing a lot of preventitive and protective programs.

Despite taking a bit of time to get the three computers installed with this program, I have had no REAL trouble aside from the program becoming unresponsive yesterday for no apparent reason. It caused a shut down of my internet explorer that I THOUGHT was a good sign (I figured it was something to do with an unsafe site I may have been on?) but then I wound up having one of those nightmarish error messages telling me, ""Trend Micro Internet Security has become unresponsive and will now close"" or something along those lines. I am still not sure what that was about-but I didn't really feel that great about it afterwards since the little red icon was missing and I was, at that point, unprotected from threats.

Overall, the ease of use is very simple and comprehendible for any beginner. Very, very easy to use. I like the Pro tool features-especially the system tuner, which cleared out over 400 Mb's of unwanted temporary files and unused programs.

As someone who is constantly plagued by viruses, I can't really grade this THAT accurately as of now. I have only had it for a week, but so far, it has performed fairly well. It seems to be a bit more steady and reliable then my former McAfee internet security suite (which froze on me ALL the time!).

I am also a little confused about the virus scanning on this. I have an additional program called Spysweeper which picked up a trojan on my computer a couple days ago, while this went unaware. That makes me a TINY bit nervous. I am not sure why this didn't grab the file first or stop it from entering before I even performed the spysweep program? Strange. Oh well! This is a decent program to help aid in computer performance and stability.

I think, if you are looking for a program you can get multiple computer uses out of, get this one. If you are looking for something for a single computer, I might go for a Norton Program instead.","So Far, So Good...",1257120000,2,

One year I ran by taxes with BOTH H&R Block and Turbo Tax, and both came up with the same answer.  The issue is not with the program's math, but the way that it asks us to answer the questions, the amount of examples to help us decide what all to include in a number, or if a certain situation applies to us or not.  Again this year, 2009, I waited until the prices came down at least 10 bucks under their usual advertised price.  Generally, you should not file until after Feb 1st as the financial companies have through January to get their forms to you.  And, it's not unusual for the tax preparation companies to have online updates well into February, and if those tweaks applied to you, you'd want them before filing.

Each year, the Federal forms go pretty well, but the State of Wisconsin's forms are lacking in the H&R versions. On several occasions, H&R's program did not handle situations that applied to me, and they tell me, this form is not supported, and here's the link to get the paper form and then I have to file paper, not electronically.  This year, the WI AMT form was not supported.  Sad.  It's not that I really want to pay the AMT tax, but if I have to, at least make it easy for me to do that!  The WI AMT form is a hard one to understand, so this would have really been a good one for H&R Block to have automated.  Maybe next year.

So why do I keep using H&R Block?  They are always 5-10 bucks less, and from what I have seen or heard, the Turbo Tax version is not that much better when it comes to the State forms.

Before FTM she used PAF. I used earlier versions of FTM a few times, but I never even approached the level she did. A few days ago I installed Family Tree Maker 2012 Premium after I finally located the backup disks from over eight years ago. The 2012 FTM software loaded the old database and converted it flawlessly. To my amazement, there were over 19,750 names and just over 7000 families in her database! It will be fairly straightforward to add another 250 names to hit the 20,000 mark.

It took me a short while to learn how to use the new software and make updates, but only a few hours. I found it more intuitive than Version 8. Since I never used Version 8 very much, others might have a different opinion. I did a trial and error approach to learning, but finally had to resort to the manual. There is a relatively thick FTM book that came with the software, but I found it easier to just make a Google search on the specific topic I wanted to know.  And I was able to find answers to the topics every time with almost no effort. The step by step illustrated instructions are very good.

I made some updates to my wife's database and signed up for the Ancestry.com 6 month free trial. Then I uploaded the entire database to the Ancestry website.  Then the Ancestry web site found several other FTM databases that compared to branches on my family tree. There were a few minor differences, but I was absolutely delighted how accurate my wife's tree information was. Of course, I still have some refinements to make.  I admit that I never would have done so much research to create such an extensive tree structure dating back over 600 years. I'm just thankful I was able to finally recover all her hard work.

You can add extensive notes and link photos, citations and many other things to any individual in the database. It has provisions for multiple marriages and children to the relevant spouse. But it will only display one spouse at a time. It allows you to pick a preferred default spouse. I wish it would display the full tree without being required to select each spouse separately. It has a provision to show foster children's families and name changes, but I have not tried to do that.  I read about it while I was learning some other things.

The performance seems very good in spite of the size of the database I have, but I am using a fast Intel i7 CPU based system with lots of RAM and two solid state disks - one for the operating system and one for the FTM files. But I think it will perform well on most modern computers. Before I installed the new FTM software, I installed Version 8 on a computer that is definitely not high speed with the same large database file. That computer handled it just fine.

The Platinum version is the one to buy. The six month free subscription to Ancestry.com is well worth the difference in price. There is a gold mine of information on Ancestry.com that can link up and compare to your own family tree saving you countless hours of research.  Without the Ancestry link, you would be wasting so much time trying to do everything by yourself. Very likely your family tree is already on Ancestry.com to some degree, perhaps back even hundreds of years.

I don't understand the picky points some people make about this product and the low scores. I'm sure they may have a very technical point to make, but it doesn't warrant anything less than 4 stars.

I should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.

POSITIVE:
* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.
*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.
* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.
* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.
* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.
* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.
* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.
* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.
* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.

NOT SO POSITIVE:
* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.
* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.
* There is no ""search"" function or ""index."" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.
* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)
* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a ""personal index"" these bookmarks have their limits.

On the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.

My last exposure to Painter was with the X3 version and the newest version has many new features that make Painter even more useful than before.

The user interface resembles Adobe Photoshop and is fairly intuitive for those that have used similar products in the past. The default set of tools lets you get to work right away. While Adobe Photoshop is great for modifying photos, it's rather limited for creating art by itself. Painter gives you access to a wide variety of paints, pens, pencils, brushes and media textures with a workflow that allows you to work more or less naturally. I highly recommend using a tablet instead of a mouse, but either will work.

For those who aren't familiar with similar programs or need some extra help, there are a large number of tutorials available to help you with almost every aspect of the program.

One of my favorite features is the watercolor brushes and paper. Although it's not quite the same as using watercolors, it allows the artist to create art that looks very similar to the real thing. I find it most useful for quick and dirty watercolor renderings of photographs by keeping the original photo down at one layer and ""painting"" over it on another layer. Yes, it's cheating. But it gives a nice result without spending hours of work with physical media. Layers and paths work much as you'd expect.

My only issue with the program is the 'lag' I sometimes get when using broad watercolor brushes and move my 'brush' too quickly. Thank goodness for undo.

Overall, I think that Painter 2016 is a fine program who want to try their hand at more involved digital art, but the sales price when this review was written is rather steep for a casual investment.",Powerful tool for creating digital art.,1446508800,9,

I have previously used a Garman GPS 60cs for hiking and such, but even as it's great for tracking in the wilderness it doesn't have near the detail that newer, larger, more street driving, oriented GPS's have.  But, it has a good signal and is pretty rugged.  That's the comparison.  The USB GPS provided took a bit bit longer than my Garmin to find the location, but when it did it was pretty surprisingly accurate.  It was very easy to install on my XP laptop, and really worked well in tracking movement and location.  The first time I plugged it in I was in the living room of a 1st floor apartment.  The signal didn't seem to go through the walls very well, and it couldn't pick anything up. That's to be expected.  Outside that location, everything worked perfect.  Easily linked up with the Streets & Trips.

A lot of details have already been given about Streets and Trips itself. I have used Garmin's software--both their North America Streets version and their Western National Parks/Forests version.  I've also become quite a fan of google maps, with occasional use of the other versions.  The major benefit, of course, to Streets and Trips is that unlike Google or the others it doesn't depend on an internet connection.  The major benefit, of course, of another Garmin or other type of GPS is that even this version packaged with the GPS is significantly cheaper--if you have a laptop already.

The software is easy to use and intuitive.  I need to poke around more but I've been pretty satisfied so far. The list of interesting places is very good, as is the overall maps and associated tools. I've not used previous versions of Streets and Trips, so I can't compare this particular version to previous ones.

The one big issue I have with it, that has me using Google a lot in short, one-stop trips is that there doesn't seem to be a way of rerouting the directions.  With Google, a little cursor click and move can shift the route to something that might be preferred for whatever reason. Living in the LA area, as I do, there are a lot of ways to get from here to there, and a lot of reasons why what might seem on paper to be the best isn't at all the best.  The only other downside isn't to do with the software, but instead having to bring my laptop with me places.  Meaning this really is something that I'd use a lot for longer trips, but not as much for the shorter ones.

I cannot even express my outrage and disgust over the two ""apologies"" I have received from Intuit over the downgrade of their TurboTax product, and their offer of $25 to ""make it right."" Apparently the Tylenol Effect has worn off, and this is the sort of corporate mumblemumble that passes for responsibility.

******************************

Like so many other longtime TurboTax users, I reviewed my 2013 return to double-check the schedules I'd need.  Sure enough, I needed to move up two levels from my trusted TT Deluxe to TT Personal & Small Business to prepare my 2014 taxes using the same tax events as in years past. I'm deeply concerned that some aspect of this new return will be critically inconsistent with years prior, and trigger an audit. At this point I'm ready to forgo Amazon's 10% bonus, and turn to H&R Block software simply for a fresh start and some peace of mind.

I was talking with a friend who is a CPA, and apparently the Intuit dissatisfaction extends across all levels of their product line; TurboTax, QuickBooks, Quicken for Mac, on and on. She has had a wretched time preparing W-2's and other tax documents for her clients this year, all due to changes with Intuit's software for TY 2014. This is a company that has built a strong customer base over decades; I know, my family was involved from almost day one.

It backed up all the programs and all the music, videos, photos and documents.  When I ran a restore after getting a new internal hard drive in the iMac, the iMac with the new hard drive was just like it was the night before the hard drive died (except the photo on the desktop was not on the desktop, but still in iPhoto).  I did not have to re-install and update any programs.  All I needed was the Leopard install disk (see update below) and the Time Machine external hard drive.  It took 5 hours to restore everything (193 GB), once I attached the external Time Machine drive to the fixed iMac.

That means if your Mac was lost or stolen, or if your internal hard drive died, you could have ""your old"" computer back as soon as you replaced either the computer or the hard drive.

PS  The iMac was ready with the new hard drive in 24 hours with Applecare.  It turns out that *if* I could not give up the computer right then, I could have bought an external hard drive (""Drive B"" let's call it) and restored to Drive B from the Time Machine backup drive (using the iMac), and I could have started the iMac from that external Drive, at least until I could live without the iMac long enough to get a new internal hard drive.  Same goes for a Macbook, I suppose.

The moral of this story is to use Time Machine and an external hard drive to back up your Mac!  It is so little hassle to back up and such a huge benefit to have.  (Our hard drive was six months old when it died, and it lived a much easier life than a hard drive in a laptop.)  If your hard drive died, you could be back up in 30 hours with a new internal hard drive or 6 hours with a temporary external hard drive (including an hour to go buy the temporary external drive).

My wife's Mom does not have much on her iMac that she cares about keeping.  I did not set up Time Machine  on her computer when I installed Leopard on it.  But after I have used Time Machine for a full restore, it would be so easy to restore her computer to exactly the way she is used to it, that I got an external hard drive for her computer and set her up with Time Machine.

(For your friends with Windows computers:  At the office I use a backup program for Windows called Vice Versa that is  available to download.  Vice Versa is for backing up to external drives, which we do automatically every night, keeping the newest one off-site.  There is also Mozy for Windows, which backs up online and, in theory, is the easiest solution.  But Mozy is slow, even with a cable modem, and you have to pay every year.  A Mozy restore is very, very slow.  Backing up a Mac with a .mac account might be like Mozy.  I never did it.)

Backing up always used to be a hassle.  With Time Machine the only hassle is getting the external drive ($100 to $200) and setting up Time Machine once.  This is such a small hassle and expense for the huge benefit, that it is crazy not to use Time Machine with an external drive. It is worth getting Leopard to get Time Machine.

Note, when you max out the backup hard drive, Time Machine gives you options for deleting unnecessary files, so you don't have to start a new backup drive when the first one is full.  A great feature.

Also, on the 3-year old iMac with OC 10.3, Leopard (OS X v. 10.5) ran much, much faster than version 10.3.  I did not perceive any speed difference from version 10.4 on the six-month-old iMac, nor on two Macbooks running v. 10.4, each less than a year old.

8/08 update.  To do a full restore you need to have the OSX DVD and, for a Mac Air, the outboard DVD player.  We were in Berkeley, needed to do a full restore on a Mac Air, had the backup hard drive, but not the OSX DVD.  Went to Emoryville Apple Store.  Would not loan me a OSX DVD to do the restore.  Did not have any OSX DVDs in stock, so I could not buy one, either. Said that Apple would mail a restore disc to me if I called them, but I had the OSX disk at home in L.A. and needed to use the DVD that day.  (It is the same version of the same OS that came with every Mac Air, so I could not have been sneaking an upgrade.)  Best Buy was out of the OSX DVDs, too, so I could not perform the full restore.  I consider this horrible customer service. Also, the OSX DVD should be optional to do a full restore.  It might make for a cleaner install of the OS, but you should be able to restore without the OSX DVD if you don't have it with you.  And an Apple store should loan you a copy if you already bought the Apple computer, have applecare for the computer, and are not in your home city.

Also, I was 20 minutes late for my Genius Bar appointment in the Emoryville store (the closest Apple store to Berkeley by car -- there is no Apple store within walking distance of the Berkeley campus.  The closest store by Bart is in SF!) on a Sat. afternoon and they refused to help me.  They said make a new appointment for another day and by the way we are booked all weekend.  I begged and my niece begged.  People canceled their times while I stood there and they would not give me the spot, told me to wait until all the people with later appointments were helped (that is, spend the rest of the day and evening waiting for them to -- possibly -- fit me in).  Zero customer service. I was appalled.  I needed a Time Capsule for my niece but I went to Best Buy to get it because I really did not want to spend a penny at the Emoryville store.  But the next morning I needed the OSX DVD (see above).  The store did not redeem itself.

Bottom line is that I love the OS, love Time Machine, and had TWO back-to-backreally bad experiences at the Emorville Apple store, one of which could have been avoided if Time Machine did not require an OSX DVD to perform a full install, or if Apple stores would loan computer owners a copy to perform the full restore.",Get it for Time Machine!,1198454400,3,

I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simpifying which only serves to confuse.

The good news: The GPS functionality has been vastly improved with voice and large visual prompts which make using the program in an automobile MUCH MUCH easier. The little car cursor in the 2005 version has been replaced by a much more visible circle with a large arrow in it indicating direction.

Despite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook.

A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.

One problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device! This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator! I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong. If you don't add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program! I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator. Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.

The included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software). The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.

Now granted, the best Windows 7 machine is also a Mac, running Snow Leopard in addition to Windows 7 Ultimate, and due to needs to keep it running only runs Windows 7 Ultimate RTM-Lion and Mountain Lion would over-stress it, and that we cannot allow, thus meaning that we have to run the RTM Windows 7 on it, but this laptop has exceeded my expectations with Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 upgrade. Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 upgrade upgrades Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 or SP2 directly, but since we had been loaning out the laptop, we decided to do the clean install and do not regret it, except for some user error on my part (forgot to save something important mainly.)

I never had a problem with Windows Vista Home Premium, but Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate on machines that support Aero is really a treat, giving the user the ultimate in compatibility, capability, and flexibility. Windows 8 I keep hearing won't even begin to compare, the least of which reasons is when clicking on the Desktop tile you don't get the fine grained system control Windows 7 gives.

I always say I want my desktop OS choices to be the best they can be for the desktops, and the mobile OS choices best for and on my PDAs, smartphones, and tablets-unless I have enough extra money to buy a Windows 7 tablet, in which case I view it as an alternative option to a traditional clamshell laptop or netbook.

I want Windows 7, because Microsoft's marketing was proved true from my experiences with the release candidate all the way to fully updated Windows 7 RTM and SP1 today. Windows 8 seems like a giant step backwards, one which I do not appreciate.

5 stars, even with SP1. Without it it's 10 stars. (I happen to know what the RTM was like, and it was awesome.)

Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:

I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.

I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.

I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.

Update 2-3-2014:

Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.

Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.

For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.

End Update 2-3-2014

Update 2-27-2014:

As posted on my Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade pages, I had a desktop with OEM Windows 7 Home Premium that I hedged my bets with by assigning it a dispensation from my Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack, and up until a few days ago I didn't have legal Office to go along with the retail Windows 7 Upgrade install. So I was considering my options but the reviews on Windows 8, even from those who rated it highly, indicated that you might have issues and I didn't need issues, I needed software that would approach the ""just works"" of the Classic Mac OS. So I sat there, installed Office 2003 off of a spare copy I picked up, and then suddenly I was set. I had no reason to consider Windows 8 for this Windows 7 OEM PC any further, and so I set up the second 1TB hard drive to backup this copy of Windows 7 as well as Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade and it went so smoothly. I am thrilled that I have a supported way out of the backup dilemma, compared to buying OEM Windows Home Server 2011 and losing use of the PC as a general-purpose desktop.

Needless to say, I got everything I wanted out of Windows 7 Ultimate (both copies) and Professional, and I'm happy.

End Update 2-27-2014

Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):

Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:

I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!

I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?

I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!

I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.

Update 1-14-2015:

I am recently availing myself of the opportunity to tear Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade 64-bit with SP1 on hardware that was midrange for 2011 by complementing my Sandy Bridge desktop with a laptop, I have to say even with all of the Windows 8 features that were loaded into Windows 7 to make up for the fact that people didn't automatically do whatever it took to go to Windows 8, it still feels so much more like Windows 7 than Lion does (the equivalent Mac OS X version) when you install all the updates, and is a key reason why I gave up my Intel iMac for a newer if lower-end PC laptop, because I wanted to be able to update my OS and have it still feel like the stock version. Apple wouldn't give me that, so I went to Windows 7,

After I uninstalled a duplicate of an update that was part of Internet Explorer 11, Windows 7 installed and updated with the greatest of ease, and it provides me with a better experience than Lion or Yosemite on contemporary or newer Macs. Windows 7 may not have been perfect, but to me I couldn't tell the difference, and I'm using it on the best hardware I've ever used it on as proof.

Windows 7 you definitely should get the Ultimate Edition of it if you can, because it's better than Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, I find it's better than Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Update 1, and due to a desire to turn Windows 9 into another Windows 8 style flop (but this time with a Live Tile-encrusted Start menu) is going to keep me on Windows 7 unless I go Mac, and like I said Lion and X.10 Yosemite have failed with Safari 6 and later, due to a huge combination of factors.

Get Windows 7 of Ultimate Edition and stick to it no matter what. I liked Windows 10 as of the Technical Preview Build 9879, but I so much won't like it as of RTM, and even as of the Technical Preview it would only be on a second hard disk opposite Windows 7, & only then if I could know I could readily go back and forth to Windows 7 for tasks I don't want to do on 8 and later, or especially Win 10 and later.

It walks a fine line quite well, packing in a ton of prosumer-level features like excellent stop-motion, motion tracking, variable speed controls and HTML5 support while staying fairly straightforward and easy to learn. So beginners can jump right in and make movies without fear of outgrowing the package too quickly.

I found the interface fairly clean and easy to navigate, though there were moments when it didn't seem entirely intuitive. However, given the flexibility that VideoStudio Pro offers, this is really not a complaint as much as an observation; there has to be give and take to find balance here. You work in one of three modes: capture, edit, or share - I like this approach, as it keeps everything quite clear for beginners and more advanced users alike.

VideoStudio easily handles pretty much any format I've thrown at it, and it can even work with Ultra HD-4K, something that competing products in this price range cannot (good news for GoPro Hero3 Black owners!).

Clip organization is mediocre: a lack of tagging can hobble users' ability to easily find what they're looking for, but the rest of the package is quite good. Editing can be done in a basic drag-and-drop style for those looking to get something together quickly and easily, but far more advanced editing is available when you need it. Overall, I prefer the VideoStudio editing experience to Sony Vegas Platinum's.

I personally dislike most transitions, but if you're NOT like me you'll be psyched: there are a ton of them. A really nice selection of effects is available as well (some work better than others, as one might expect), though an upgrade to VideoStudio Ultimate X6 nets a few more that approach real pro quality; the price difference is only a couple of bucks and I'd recommend looking at it.

As I said, I think Corel has struck a great balance here. Beginners can jump in and start editing quickly, while more advanced users can stretch their legs and do some very advanced things. If your budget is under a hundred bucks for a video editing package and you want something that you won't hit the limits of too quickly (particularly if you're able to shoot in 4K), it's tough to go wrong with VideoStudio Pro X6.","Great For Beginners, Plus Room To Grow",1374019200,,

So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system.  Let's get to the nitty gritty:

Should you upgrade from Windows Vista?  YES!  I mean it - upgrade today.
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.  Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2.

Should you upgrade from Windows XP? Maybe, but for different reasons.
XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good.  However, XP is old as an operating system.  Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7.  That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system.

64 bit or 32 bit?
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section.  If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better.  If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now.

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
I recommend you have:
-a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine
-4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market)
-good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50)
-back up your files to a USB drive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-My-Passport-Essential-500-GB-USB-2-0-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-WDME5000TN-Midnight-Black/dp/B001F9LY14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black)</a>
-check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7

INSTALLATION:
Installation was very straight forward.  You put in the CD and reboot your machine.  You might have to enter your bios and enable the ""boot from CD"" option.  Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation.  You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation.  I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system.  It worked great.
The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider.
I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should  help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition.  I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front.  That said, I recently upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-CP2025DN-Color-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B001F0RI1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer</a>&nbsp;that I love so no real loss there.  I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print.  Everything else upgraded.

BENEFITS
-faster boot time
-faster go to sleep
-faster wakeup
-faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond)
-joining wireless networks is much easier
-the interface is just plain beautiful
-my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture)
-Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop.  I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me
-Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running
-Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data.  It's great!  I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files!
-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love.
-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-3User-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010</a>. Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but

CONS:
- Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver.
- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS.

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET?
I got the ultimate version because I have clients who ask, ""is your hard drive encrypted?"" -- I wanted to be able to say yes and have sensitive data encrypted one of my computer volumes - Bitlocker is only available in the Ultimate version.  Ultimate also includes Multilanguage support.

If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition.  If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining.  Also Windows Professional gives you the option to run applications in XP mode so if you have old applications you can use that nifty feature.  I already have 1 application running in XP mode - it's nifty to run an old application.

NOTE:
The box contains both the 32 bit and 64 bit OS.

OVERALL:
It's very hard to write a comprehensive review on an entire operating system so I didn't even try - I'm sure magazines will devote entire articles to the operating system and several books will come out.  My goal here is just to give everyone a glimpse of what I've found to date with this new OS. I do hope this has helped you in making a decision.

Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.

The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (""Fireworks"" for ""Firefox,"" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.

Since each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the ""Watch and work"" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.

New features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.

If you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice.

At some point I started keeping our full financial records in it, including cash transactions.  I'm glad I did.  I now have a nice historical record of our living costs over the years.  I can tell you for example, that in 2009 I spent $9500.59 for groceries and $3470.33 dining out for a family of six.  Escalating energy prices brought along pretty high inflation and in 2012 I spent $11,112.46 for groceries and $5704.92 dining out.  There is all kinds of useful data you can easily draw out by using the reports feature in Quicken.  In 2009 we spent $3188 on fuel for our vehicles.  In 2013 that figure jumps to $6656.  There's some serious inflation... I currently track 32 accounts in my primary Quicken file.  They include, cash, checking, savings, investments, IRAs, and property accounts.  Everything is in one place and it makes it all quite easy to manage.

If my Quicken file ever became corrupted and I didn't have a good backup I'd be devastated.  For that reason I make redundant backups and replications to more than one location.

Now, what about Quicken 2015 specifically?  I really don't know why I purchase Quicken again every year.  But I've gotten in the habit.  The last few years have seen a Quicken full of bugs introduced to market. For that reason I waited a while before getting the 2015 version.  Posts by others throughout the internet world indicate that the 2015 version was quite buggy as well.  When I read about users Quicken data files getting corrupted... I worry.  Quicken must do a better job and ensure they put out a solid product when it first hits the shelves.

Quicken is a very useful financial program.  To get the full benefit you need to use it for 100% of your finances... except maybe for your under-the-table black market activities :). You don't need to replace it every year.  Every 3 or 5 years would be often enough.  For 2015 the only really noticeable change that I saw was I could request a free credit score through Quicken. I started that process but aborted it when I was asked to provide my social security number.  At that point I decided I didn't really need to know what my credit score was.  Quicken is already such a full featured program that Intuit must have to jump through hoops to figure out stuff they can add to the program.

As the program gets more and more bloated I would imagine that new Quicken users might find it more difficult to figure the program out...",Quicken is a Powerful Tool if You're Dedicated to Using it to Cover All of Your Financial Transactions.,1423612800,,

While there are many free and shareware options available, they aren't always compatible with many systems. 7-Zip, a popular option was used by my company. I had to stop using it because everyone I sent zip files to could not open or read anything compressed with 7-Zip even though many had the program installed on their computers. We never had this problem using WinZip. It is a standard that does work well with virtually any program. I didn't see a large amount of difference between version 17 as opposed to version 18. It is still fast and efficient. I do love the integration with the cloud services. WinZip will zip to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive (formerly Skydrive from Microsoft), Box, SugarSync and CloudMe. It will also zip to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It also will encrypt your files for protection. The Cloud navigation has been improved, though it was always easy for me to access my Cloud zips before. You can also send links to you zip files in the Cloud if you need to share them. I also love the fact that you can create PDF files from WinZip and add watermarks. That is a great option if you don't have a PDF creator available. You can also create self-extracting zip files for those who don't have a zip program. It handles the usual RAR, 7-Zip, BZ2 and many others.

The new Add-Ons are available for Windows Explorer (in Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows 8 has replaced Explorer with OneDrive), photos, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint (Enterprise option for work) and photos.

Although I find WinZip to be the best service for zipping, compressing and encrypting files that I have used, Corel charges for everything now, upgrades to Pro, extra charges for the Add-Ons. I am certain these were separated because inclusion would have made the program more costly and everyone does not need as many features. WinZip has also ballooned to include a wide variety of services besides the base product and you will hear about those after you register your email address (required). It is still the best overall for regular consumers and the easiest to use that works with nearly everything.

  In addition to unlimited home licensing, VIPRE carried their product one more step in allowing you to install their product on a netbook without the need of buying an external DVD reader (most net books do not have an internal CD/DVD drive, such as my MSI Wind).

Installing VIPRE on a NETBOOK:

  All you have to do is put your VIPRE installation disc into your computer's drive and copy the disc's content onto an empty thumb/flash drive. Once the files are successfully copied insert the flash drive into your net books usb drive and follow the onscreen installation instructions! It's that easy!

Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

This application comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I logged into my existing Norton account (setting up a new one is not difficult). I used the key code provided to activate my subscription. This starts the term of the subscription: not the first installation. All 10 devices share the same term with this product.

Product installation on PC's is performed either by logging into the Norton account the software is registered with or downloading the software via a link in an invitation email. On IOS the software an an app in the Apple app store. When started you login to the Norton account to activate the device.

I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security with Backup is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.

Backup Use:

This is Norton Security *with* Backup. The software supports backup to the Norton cloud and to local devices. It includes 25GB of cloud storage for the 1 year term of the license. I did not use the cloud option and setup backup to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WD-My-Passport-Slim-2TB/dp/B00EO3031A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WD My Passport Slim 2TB</a>. Backup completed with reasonable speed. There is reasonable control over what gets backed up. It is a nice backup tool. I feel it's important to mention that Windows 7 Pro has a good built-in backup tool that is free, easy to use and will backup to a local device. That said, Norton provides a cloud option and is even easier than the windows Backup. Is it worth the extra cost over the non-backup version? Not for me on a Windows PC, but it could be for a lot of folks.

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antiviruses on this computer did not and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Backup is pretty decent. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.

Because it's a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I'm giving it 4 stars.","The NEW Norton Generation, DECENT Backup, BREAKS VirtualBox, WEAK IOS App",1413244800,68,

Over the past few years I had been noticing system slowdowns that seemed to be related to things like auto-download and installation of frequent updates of virus definitions. I figured that's the price I'd have to pay to keep my PC and data safe. I've been reading over the past year or two, though, that McAfee users seemed to feel the software and updates didn't bog down Windows (XP) as much.

After installing this software via the included CD (I much prefer buying software online these days...personal preference), I did a few startup tests to note extra delays (McAfee definitely loaded faster); virus scans to monitor speed (no viruses here, fortunately), and made sure to monitor an online update/download while my PC was running 4 or 5 other applications, the way I usually work. I heard some disk activity but barely noticed a slowdown in the other processes.

I'm going to stick with it for a while, especially since this comes as a 3-user pack, but I hate the idea of wasting the 200+ more days of Norton virus updates I already paid for. Also, the McAfee scans did drive home the welcome realization that the Norton/Symantec software I had been running was doing its job pretty darn well. On the other hand, I'm certainly willing to change at this point.

An all new, easier to use finder. Upgrades to several of the popular iApps which Apple has been nurturing. Plus, iChatAV instant messaging software which will work seemlessly with the iSight camera. File Vault - 128-bit file encryption. Fast user switching, to make it easier for families who have individual user sets on a single machine. Font Book - to load and keep track of font families. Expos, which will tile all of the windows you have open with the click of a hot key. And, it's all Unix based for faster and easier integration with Windows networks.
On top of all that, it'll work more efficiently on the G5 Macs, and make the G4's work even faster than before.

Although you could do the research manually, Ancestry.com consolidates a tremendous amount of information from divers historical documents and makes it relatively easy and efficient to discover information about relatives from long ago.

Family Tree Maker Deluxe allows the user to create (and back-up) genealogy offline before submitting it online, so it's my preferred method. You can work with your tree online, but by using the program on my home computer, then syncing when done, I avoid Internet glitches or user errors that cause lost data. So far, I haven't encountered any problems with this software, or with synching.

While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

I can also tell you, however, that Premier probably isn't worth it for the vast majority of people, even if they have investments. The basic version will still allow you to fill out capital gains sheets. The only thing this really gives you is the ability to better handle rental property and gives you tools to value and maximize deductions. If you have a home business that doesn't have employees (and thus no payroll taxes) you can also get by with Deluxe, instead of Home Business. They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. They can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. The main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with Deluxe or Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns.

It does seem to be a bit faster -- except that the ""VideoBoost"" function that it uses to convert MP4 files doesn't work on either 11 or 12 but did work for me in 10. One new feature is that it will capture video of screencasts. It's not, though, a full featured screencasting program. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work much better than what you get free with the Quicktime Player (on a Mac at least). It also crashes every once in a while: I was going to do a screencast for this review, and wanted to show how it works to convert video files, and while I was screencasting I tried to convert a video file and it crashed on me. I've had no problems, though, with the kind of functions that I use on Toast all the time: mostly converting and archiving video and burning dvds.

I've been using Toast since I switched to Macs from PCs about ten years ago - I think I might have started out with Toast 5 or 6. I've found it does a lot of things I tend to do a lot, and does them fairly quickly: convert video, burn video to dvds, burn cds, etc. Some of those functions are, lately, less essential. Now I burn CDs using iTunes, and tend to burn dvds directly from the program I use to create them such as iDVD or, more often, Adobe Encore. But, when I want to burn a dvd without a menu, or just to burn a random file to a CD or DVD-rom, Toast is still faster than both of those programs. Anyhow, with Toast 10 & 11 it became possible to convert AVCHD files to any playable or editable format I like, even when I don't have the camcorder plugged in as required by iMovie or Final Cut Pro. That can be extremely useful, and Toast 10 also allowed you to burn an AVCHD archive to disk. Toast 12 can do all that, and does it a bit faster.

Several functions on Toast can be done elsewhere on programs you're already likely to have. Still, for many such functions it's easier and quicker to fine-tune things with Toast. When I make videos in Premiere Pro or iMovie, for example, I can convert the files to the format I choose on export. But it's not easy to tell from those programs how big the finished file will be. Sometimes after I get the file I find it's too big to upload or send to whoever I planned it for. The easiest thing to do, then, is just drop it on Toast and convert it again, adjusting settings until it predicts a size I need. For professional work, that wouldn't fly because you'd want to just convert it once and get less compression artifacts that way. For sharing with friends or uploading to youtube or Amazon, the quicker the better and Toast is the quickest I've found.

Is it worth the upgrade from Toast 10 or 11? I'm not convinced, but it does have a few new useful features, and it does convert video faster if you have a video card compatible with their VideoBoost feature (oddly, the card on my 2013 Macbook Pro isn't). If you don't already have Toast 10, and you work with video and other files a lot, then it might be worth it -- although there are some decent free converters out there. Toast Pro 11 came with Premiere Elements, which really made it a great deal, but Toast 12 doesn't.

One thing to note: from my experience, Roxio's customer service is pathetic. Whenever I've interacted with them about a problem in the past, I get a generic response that seems like it could have been generated by a computer that searched a database based on a few keywords in my query. On the other hand, every problem I've ever asked them about has eventually been fixed by subsequent updates.

Professionals, those used to versions 2000-2003, and those who need expert control of the program (i.e. macros and the like in Excel), then do not get this program, you'll have a tought time finding the same functionalities as in v. 2003.  But, since this is the special media edition, I did enjoy this one part of MS Office 2008.  It really does an excellent job of organizing all of my HD videos and photos, hence I give it 1 star over the regular version (which I rated a 3).  The visual interface of being able to see what files you are actually organizing instead of just icons and numbers really helps group the pictures and videos into exactly what I need, this is really a neat feature.  You can actually ""preview"" each media file without opening it, again saving you the time of figuring out what you are organizing.  Make sure, however, that you have more than the minimum system requirements for this special part of MS Office.  I put this version on one of my computers, I had more than enough RAM and processing speed, and the preview part would take up a lot of RAM, slowing down my computer quite a bit!!!

I'd reccomend staying with an earlier office product, and waiting for a new one to come out that is hopefully better for business professionals.  Creative individuals or those in the creative work profession will probably not have ad tough of a time with this edition of office as I did.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,,

As a retired IT manager, I realize that fixes require time, and I am more patient than most.

The ""Operations in Progress"" behavior prevents Windows users from properly shutting down their machines. While the Acronis site states that this is short-term, necessary behavior for its application to complete processing, in fact, it will lock the shutdown process indefinitely.  For a full description of the problem, and the simple kinds of coding changes Acronis could have made to fix it, go to my review of the 2014 product at http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TT0JA4FRFOLM/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFRMBA6#R1TT0JA4FRFOLM.

The software behaved differently for a few months following the 2015 release's installation in November 2014, in that the ""Operations in  Progress"" message usually timed out.  But then, it abruptly changed back to the behavior so disliked in the 2014 release, always stopping the shutdown indefinitely. This tells me that not only has the problem not been fixed, but it certainly appears that Acronis altered the software without public notice a few months into this release. Any company that treats its customers with due respect will (a) listen to widespread concerns, and fix them; and (b) not apply updates without the customer's knowledge. However, Acronis projects an impression of corporate stubbornness and arrogance.

For a company that announced a billion-dollar (with a ""b"") revenue goal in  March 2014, there is no excuse. Staffing should not be an issue.  And the fixes should take only a few man-hours of coding time (if that), provided the software was written intelligently in the first place. I suspect the staff  who reported to me could complete them in less than an hour.

The ""Operations in Progress"" problem continues to mess up Windows updates, many of which depend upon an orderly shutdown process that is not blocked by a third-party application like Acronis.

I am researching reviews for other backup options.  I am impatient to move away from Acronis's products and its disrespect of customers.","Widespread user requests to resolve ""Operations in Progress"" issue still not resolved",1431561600,2,

Meeks Jr.,"I have not used a speech to text product in some time, the last being Dragon Dictate for Windows from a few years back. This is the first version of Dictate for the Mac that I have used, but the products are similar in how they work.

My goal is to have a way of transcribing voice memos I record with my iPhone. I went through the set up procedure, skipping over the part where it asks you to create a nuance account as part of registration (I guess I will be prompted to do this again later).  For training the software I used a voice recording I made of something I had previously written. It requires 90 seconds of audio to work; I gave it a 2 minute piece. The first pass during the training had a lot of errors which I corrected. The software then translated the voice recording and it still had quite a few errors. I tried again where I made a concerted effort to speak slower and more clearly. This second effort rewarded me with a better translation, but still with errors that I had to edit. I then tried a third time, with a different text, and this further improved, but still with errors.

I then switched gears and tried the voice transcription from a live recording. First I used the included USB microphone. Surprisingly, it worked a bit better, still with errors but fewer. I then tried recording with a bluetooth headset and it worked about as well, so it is the way I will go from now on.

My conclusion is that it is probably unrealistic for me to expect 100% accuracy. If I am focused on good diction and pacing, I can improve accuracy. Using a good audio source with minimal background noise is likely a necessity. The microphone in the iPhone may not be of high enough quality, although I am going to continue to try this route, since it is primarily what I am interested in using the software for. I see potential here, as I have continued to see improvement. I would like for the software to be able to take multiple sample audio files with corrections and use that to improve accuracy. But I think it will continue to improve with time.","Shows Promise, but requires work to get best results.",1401148800,,
7458,4,False,"08 12, 2013",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00CNLGONQ,,Brent Butler,"Most people know that Sage 50 in its various incarnations is the evolution of the old Peachtree. For a very long time, either Peachtree or QuickBooks was the choice for small business, and that's still the case.

I'm assuming that most people already using software of this type are likely very capable of deciding on accounting software features, so I'm going to position this review as general advice for you folks who've been running your business out of a checkbook and a spreadsheet and not much else.

Under the latest feature packages and user licensing, QuickBooks lighter licenses are probably the choice for very small businesses. Sage 50 is great accounting software, but in the long run will cost you a lot more. You'll get value for that expense, but you'll want to make sure that what you're getting are actually features, users and so forth that you really need to spend the money on.

If you haven't been using a software package for small business accounting, you'll need to be prepared to learn some accounting principles and put them into action. You'll need to familiarize yourself with things like a Chart of Accounts for your General Ledger, tying all of your business transactions to these G/L Accounts, and for the most part positioning the way you do business to fit the way this accounting software will allow you to do things. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Many small business have informal ways of handling money and tracking their records that don't stand up well under audit. If you conform to these accounting packages' methods and adhere to using them, you'll do a better job of managing your money, and you'll be prepared anytime you are required to show a proper audit trail.

In our software and consulting business, we see a LOT of different types of businesses of all sizes that use either Sage or QuickBooks and don't have any trouble at all fitting their various product and financial eccentricities into the strictures of the software. And if the companies I've seen do well with it are able to do that, odds are that anyone really can. LOL

Bear in mind that there is no guarantee that just because you have accounting software of this type, you are going to be able to do stand-alone accounting. Most of the medium to large businesses I know which use software like this also use accounting consultants to help set-up and double check things, and also use CPAs for anything from monthly to yearly audits.

I'm not going to go over the features of this software in detail, because they are listed above in a well organized format. Basically once you start using software like this you're going to be more organized about how you track your customers, your inventory, your A/R and A/P, and you're going to have a wide range of reports to see all kinds of interesting, useful, and sometimes scary trends in what happens to your money.

It's a plunge that every business needs to take sooner or later. Once you do, I wouldn't make the decision on whether to use the particular package just from the information and reviews here. Talk to some other business owners with approximately your size and line of business. Ask what they use ... how it works for them ... what it makes easier ... what it makes less convenient. Use that as the starting ground for your research. Then go to these companies web sites and carefully consider their various license levels for features and users. Make sure you match both your current needs and anything you may need to step up to in the short to mid-term. If your business is growing or rapidly evolves to meet changing market conditions, it's a mistake to choose an accounting package based solely on today's needs.

The important thing to remember, as I mentioned above, is that you have a lot of work ahead of you once you take this step, so make sure to allow time for that and fully commit to getting it done. Spending a lot of money on your accounting package is merely a waste if you get too busy or too intimidated to convert your routine to using it.","Great software, not so much for licensing",1376265600,,

It's not only about losing your own data. It's about your system being turned into a robot to send out millions of spam messages a day. If your system is open and unprotected, it in essence can be taken over by anyone on the web. This could turn you into a porn system, a spam system, or many other kinds of illegal systems without you ever knowing. You really need to keep your system locked for your safety as well as the safety of others. Never mind your legal implications if you let your unprotected system become a storehouse of child porn. (""Really officer, I had no idea ..."")

McAfee and Norton are traditionally two of the big names in the PC protection world. We have used both on and off over the years. Recently we have given the edge to Norton for their anti-virus software abilities. You only need one virus to hit you to wipe out your data and to turn your machine into a porn-distributing robot. When we had the opportunity to try McAfee, we thought we might as well see how it was doing.

The first thing I have to say is you CANNOT review an antivirus software package after only a week of us!! That is not a valid test. You need to use it for months to see how it actually performs. This is a long term software package, not one that works for a week and tells you much of anything. That is like buying a retirement stock portfolio and judging it after a week's worth of time.

So we've had this for several months now. Issue 1. It really slows down your system. Far more than other systems do. Since most of us use our computers for things that we do not want to wait 8 hours to complete, a slow system is not a good thing. There is no reason for the system to crawl the way it does when McAfee is running.

Even more importantly though it does NOT provide reliable virus protection. I might even accept a slower system if I knew it was being properly protected. However, it is not! The system that was running McAfee on it got hit with a virus that Norton blocked on our other systems. That right there is the ultimate failure mark. If you are running anti-virus software on a system, and it gets  a virus anyway that damages data, just what was the purpose of the slow anti-viral software? Especially when other software at the same price did its job properly.

We haven't tried yet, but we've also heard that this software auto-bills yearly without asking your permission and that canceling the software is a royal pain in the butt. That is the death knell as far as we are concerned.

Because I am currently using one of the free anti-virus programs available on the web (Avast), and I am more than pleased with it, and not always pleased with all of Norton's policies, so I will not permanently switch to their product. My reasons are:

1) Although there is some discussion about it, it appears that Norton disables itself completely when your license expires. Which means, no protection for your computer. I did a search on the web and found varying opinions on this. Some people state that it disables completely, others have said it only prevents future updates of the virus protection software and data base on your computer. Either way, it wasn't worth the risk for me to continue using their product.

(I know I sound paranoid. Experience has made me cautious.)

This is a revamped Leopard and not a totally new operating system, but succeeds at improving on already great features. There are software compatibility problems, so it may pay to wait a month or so before upgrading to avoid the annoyance of non-working software.

The installation couldn't have been more smooth--you basically put in the DVD, hit install, and the OS installs itself.  Unlike every other version of Microsoft Windows, the machine doesn't have to reboot multiple times and Snow Leopard doesn't require any user input until after it reboots into itself.

The OS offers a nice tweak on OS X's usual features.  There are also a lot of 'under the hood' improvements that take full advantage of 64 bit processing and others that make life easier for software developers.  Apple's description above tells you about most of the improvements, so I won't reiterate that here.  The ones that really shine for me in everyday use are the improved 'stacks' features in the dock, incredible improvements in Expose, expanded 'Quick look' capabilities,faster start up, faster backups with time machine, and Microsoft exchange capabilities in Mail.  Overall, the computer seems to work faster.  In particular, video processing in iMovie and iDVD seem to have gained some more speed.  I have a lot of pictures on iPhoto and before Snow Leopard there was a lot of lag when starting iPhoto up.  Now starting iPhoto is much snappier.

As many reviewers have pointed out, there's no 'killer' application here and this is less of a new operating system and more of an upgrade on the existing system.  But the price is right and the features really do make the most pleasant to use OS out there even better.

Alas, all is not wine and roses.  There are now internet lists of compatibility problems with software.  If you want to run older software, you have to install Rosetta (now a separate installation).  My biggest annoyance was Microsoft Office 2008: once I upgraded, none of the components would load.  Uncharacteristically for an Apple, the program just hung in the air and would not respond, necessitating a force quit.  After a couple of days and no Microsoft patches in sight, I canvassed the net.  This was a 'font loading' problem.  What I had to do was verify all the fonts in fontbook and remove the offending ones.  I then had to restore them so that Microsoft Office would print in something other than symbol fonts.

This was not an insurmountable problem, but was the first time in three years of owning a Mac that I had any problems whatsoever. Obviously, Microsoft Office is a third party program and you can't fault Apple completely for compatibility issues.  Even so, lack of Office if you rely on it can make your life miserable. (Kudos to NeoOffice/OpenOffice, their program worked without a hitch.  So did iWork, for the record, but this is an Apple product.) My guess would be that this kind of problem will occur less and less as developers realize that such problems are occurring.  Most problems can be preemptively solved by upgrading all your software before installing Leopard.

The folks at Mac most likely released this OS as a preemptive strike against the onslaught of Microsoft's latest system, Windows 7.  Having played with the Windows 7 release candidate, I don't think that Apple has much to fear.  Windows 7 is a vast improvement over Vista, in my opinion, but it won't win over the OS X faithful.  And given the economy, the vast majority of users and companies will stick to the more ubiquitous Windows systems rather than buying new hardware.  (My guess is that Windows 7 will be competing more with other versions of itself rather than OS X or Linux for market share.)  Even so, Apple probably wanted to keep its cutting-edge image alive.

Snow Leopard is well worth the price of admission.  As above, I would recommend waiting a week or two before installing it so that the 3rd party vendors have time to eliminate the compatibility problems.","Makes the already great OS X even better; but, consider waiting until the 3rd party software compatabillity kinks are worked out",1251936000,3,

When I first installed it and found that the (controversial) ribbon from Office 2007 for PC wasn't there, I felt like I had been cheated somehow.  However, as I used Office for Mac more, I found that the ribbon was the least of my worries.  I have two primary criticisms...

First, Office 2008 is exceedingly slow.  I have a 3.06GHz C2D iMac with 4Gb RAM and this is, without doubt, the slowest launching program I have.  Even after multiple updates, it's still 2-3x slower than Pages on first launch.  Furthermore, while using the program, actions like autocorrection, etc take almost a full second to implement, during which time Office stops responding graphically (it's actually working, just not displaying anything until it churns through the autocorrect, after which it ""speed types"" in what was in the buffer).

Second, the Thesaurus is also particularly disapppointing, since it doesn't seem to be able to sense the forms of words.  Many ""-ing"" words show their root in the thesaurus, which you then use to find a synonym and, after inserting, you have to go back and manually change the form.  Ridiculous.

Third, there appears to be a bug (perhaps related to the autocorrect lag) where changes to a document sometimes cause a ""visual corruption.""  It's difficult to explain, but an example would be where a significant amount of text is changed from double-space to singe-space.  After doing so, it is entirely possible to have a ""phantom"" sentence on the page that disappears if you scroll up then back down.  It's almost as if Word correctly moved everything, but forgot to update the screen to show the changes.

There are several other problems that I just don't have the heart to detail here (some of them are personal frustrations with design decisions).  The bottom line, however, is that this is the first Office suite in 15 years that I have wished I could ""unbuy.""  There are too many ""annoyances"" here.  It could be that I use documents between Office 2007 on a PC and 2008 on a Mac, but shouldn't there be 100% compatibility. Perhaps the 2011 version will be better, but for the time being, this is the single most frustrating piece of software I currently have on my iMac, primarily because I know how well it works on the PC side.  I'm not one given to conspiracy theories, but I just can't help but shake the feeling that Microsoft didn't put their best and rightest on this ""Mac"" project. :(","One Mac app that doesn't ""just work.""",1259971200,7,

The only somewhat annoying step was that I had to ""register"" with a Quicken User Name and password, etc. individually when converting each QP2012 portfolio to QP2015 format - that is, it doesn't provide a global ""registration"" applicable to all portfolios.

All the major ones have been growing in leaps and bounds over the years, and much of what companies have been adding hasn't been all that helpful. Adding another hundred transition effects doesn't do much for me because there are a few dozen at most that I'll use in real life, and even at that I'll use only a handful on any given project.

This time around, I found enough improvements that I expect to use this regularly. On the surface, PowerDirector had more than a superficial similarity with programs such as Corel VideoStudio and Pinnacle Studio. Those two have been around for a long time, and all three were based around the three basic steps of capturing, editing and producing your video. The other two are now both Corel products, and the Pinnacle one recently got a face lift, while the other two have retained more of their look and feel. Nevertheless, PowerDirector has added some features that made editing far more powerful and easy, especially for more complex tasks such as multiple camera work. Even if you've never thought of doing that, perhaps you've recorded something with your video camera and you know a couple of people who made videos with their phones or cameras at the same time. Maybe somebody walked in front of your shot, while they captured the same event from the side. This software will let you sync up those videos by analyzing the sound so the timing is correct. It will show you a window with several videos at once, so if you are watching the same action from four angles, you can change which one goes on the final output simply by clicking on one of them, and then clicking on another at any moment.

PowerDirector already added what I consider the best subtitle tool among similar editing products, and that continues to be true. It even works well with foreign languages and fonts, so if you want Korean or Vietnamese subtitles for example, it won't give you any problem. These days, any of the common products will have more than enough capability to let you do more than you'll need with titles, transitions and authoring. PowerDirector has had several iterations to work out issues with stereoscopic 3D, and the product handles it well. I haven't found any that do a great job of adding 3D special effects that will work in layers though.

My biggest objection to PowerDirector in the past was that the screen kept getting busier, they were big on pop-ups for upselling, and some of the items flashing on the screen made me feel as if I were in Times Square. This time around, the product looks much cleaner to me.

I didn't go into much detail about basic editing, since all those tasks have been there for years. I've seen my wishlist items go from wanting widescreen to wanting HD to wanting 3D to wanting to edit many videos at once, and those features have been there for some time. I was running out of items to hope for that would be worthy of getting a new version, but this one made enough fundamental changes rather than adding thousands more effects that I don't need.

All along, home video editing software has been a great way to get those clips together and come up with something much better. This will handle everything from letting you capture video from those old DV or Digital 8 tapes to working with video from the latest 4K video from your super new phone. I can't think of a video output format that I'd want to use that they don't support, and it will be hard for them to come up with something next year that will beat this. Whether your video editing needs are complex or whether you simply want to drag clips together in a desired order and trim parts you don't want, this software can make things easy.

The one criticism I have is that video editing software has been among the last types of software to continue to come with a paper manual, and that has come to an end even among competing products. It's not easy to have a manual on the screen when you'd like to have the editing software take up the full screen, so the learning curve might be impacted.",A big improvement,1418256000,37,

After having good luck with 'Geek Squad' with my PC as described above, we were going to call them and probably spend a few hundred dollars more to get her PC operational.  But before we called 'Geek Squad', I thought to myself why not try installing Kaspersky in her computer, and see if I could run a complete system scan to get rid of viruses and spyware that had slowed down her PC to almost a standstill.  Amazingly, Kaspersky detected close to almost 300 'infections', and either deleted or quarantined/neutralized ALL OF THEM!  This product is utterly AMAZING, and in one simple system scan, FIXED my wife's PC!  It now works like new, and we have Kaspersky running to keep things this way.

If you wanted to visit the online help link, you will quickly find it is just an HTML version of the pdf User Guide, something the User Guide does not tell you as it directs you to open the online help. There's no tutorial for its use that I can see and terminology casually tossed about is not defined (I didn't know what a scrubber was at first.)

The problem is that in a program as complex as a video editor, especially one that is nowhere as intuitive to use as some of its competitors, it is imperative that documentation exists. Clear, and simple documentation. It wouldn't have killed anyone at Corel to create a few tutorials as well.
The Corel Discovery Center on YouTube doesn't really  have anything you can sink your teeth into--out of 101 videos uploaded, only 18 are on video editing and most of those are for past versions of the software. The videos that do exist cover various special effects, nothing basic. If  you want to really learn, it appears you must pay for the privilege.

In addition, since the user base for VideoStudio isn't that large, there are next-to-no videos on YouTube (since that's where Corel decided to store their tutorial videos) like  you do with some other more popular video editing suites such as Sony Vegas. Typing in ""Sony Vegas Tutorial"" into the search bar in YouTube reveals 292,000 results. Typing ""Corel Videostudio Pro X6 tutorial"" shows 7,470 results. The number one hit being a review of the software, not actually a tutorial. Dismal indeed.

If Corel was serious about garnering a larger share of the market, it would ensure that there was an easy way for those using their software to easily learn how it works.

Nevertheless, attempting to wade through the User Guide is practically useless on the first try. Terminology, as I've already said, is introduced willy nilly along with concepts that don't tie into anything a beginner would know about editing video. What is a ""key frame""? How does one go about finding out what it is? No clue. What is the overlay track and how is it different from the video track? No idea.

Even the Getting Started Guide is of no help. The ""Understanding the Workspace"" section is a one-pager with minuscule and quick descriptions of the Capture, Edit (""The editing stage is where you create real magic."" Thanks.) and Share. Quick tutorials covers add on-screen narration, applying a blur with track motion and making 4 HD videos into 1 Ultra HD (4K) Movie. Very helpful in a what's supposed to be a ""Getting Started"" guide.

Not until page 117 of the User Guide do you get to understand what an Overlay is (""... used to overly clips to combine with your video in the Video Track."" Also ""... used to insert video while keeping the audio from the main track ..."") but is then followed by ""... To make overlay clips with transparent background, you can create a 32-bit alpha channel AVI video file ..."" Huh?

I would really like to know how to use VideoStudio Pro X6, but the information I initially have to go on is inadequate. I can see that there are a number of incredibly good-looking things you can do, but I have no idea what I'm doing and the documentation does not help. What little I've been able to do, I've had to figure out myself with a little help from the User Guide and I continue to tutor myself on the finer points of using VideoStudio.

All that carping aside, here are some rather good points for the software starting with an easy installation. I was running the software within 30 minutes and had been able to update it immediately after registration. Since the documentation was useless, I decided to jump right in. Let me take the time to make this observation: making copies of your original video files is recommended because, not knowing what I was doing, I really messed up a few things and had to restore from backup. Also, as the documentation says, it is a good idea to keep your video files on a specific data drive apart from the VideoStudio installed disk. Good advice since video editing can slow things down remarkably and more so when both the data and the software are in the same location.

The sheer amount of stuff that it is possible to do is immense and I think this is one reason I'm sort of flabbergasted there are no good tutorials. There are about 130 different transitions available, 34 different ways to insert a title--and with editing available for those themselves, the options are just about limitless--and 94 Special Effects that can be inserted into a project.

There is a sound mixer that allows finely-grained editing of the video sound, inserting voice-over narration tracks, inserting third-party music and modifying up to 20 overlay tracks, including the ability to change the stereo effects of the sound so as to be left or right channel heavy, if that makes sense. Or you can opt for 'Auto Music', which has a ton of ready made tracks with the proper mood it can insert at your pleasure with subfilters, and even variations. Fantastic.

I haven't played with it, but I've seen the Track Motion feature that allows you to follow an object on screen with a text overlay. It is possible to slow a clip for effect or speed it up. Some of these features are just astounding: it is possible to take a long series of pictures and then combine them together to form a time-lapse movie of those photographs. I mean, there's truly an immense number of things it is possible to achieve. I just wish Corel would do a better job of documenting and teaching.

Bear in mind that the suggested system resource requirements aren't enough, you need quite a bit of computing horsepower to do the majority of this stuff comfortably, or be subject to long pauses and of course, even longer rendering times.

In summary, VideoStudio Pro X6 is feature heavy with high tonnage in features and capabilities and, if you're a beginner, it's going to take quite a bit of time investment to get the job done. But, as I proved to myself, I was able to dive into creating and working with a project then outputting it to a YouTube video with less than an hour's worth of experimentation and about that long of reading the User Guide.

4 stars out of 5 for the software itself, for the very reasonable price (its competitors are quite a bit more expensive), but with one star taken away for the steep learning curve that Corel seems to want you to climb on your own.","Beginners Beware: Complex, Feature-full Software",1373932800,5,

1) You have Vista Ultimate and don't want to lose all your programs/settings (more on this in a moment)
2) You want BitLocker hardware-level encryption.  You'll need to do some tinkering with a USB key or have hardware that supports it (see comments to this review for details)
3) You regularly work in multiple languages and need to easily switch from one to the other

Unlike Vista Ultimate, Windows 7 Ultimate doesn't offer DreamScenes or any other eye candy different from its cousins Home and Pro.  In fact, if you were a fan of the Windows Vista DreamScenes, you should know that you will be losing them when you step up to Windows 7.

Some very important things you need to know about upgrading:

1) There are two types of upgrade:  ""in-place"" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and ""clean"" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).
2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go ""clean"".
3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home up to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate down to 7 Home) will also have to go ""clean"".
4) Anyone going from any Home or Business Vista to 7 Ultimate can do an in-place upgrade.
5) Enterprise Vista can only upgrade to Enterprise 7.
6) You cannot do an ""in-place"" upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit.

If you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.

Before you even buy a 7 upgrade for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:

a) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.  Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7.  It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading.  Even very new machines will have one or two programs that need some checking.
b) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all).  This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices.

Anything major, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend double-checking with the manufacturer's website to be sure.  This almost burned me on two of the machines that I upgraded.

Last, make a backup.  There's a free tool called Macrium Reflect that can do this for you.

Do you have to do a ""clean"" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings?  Microsoft makes a program called Windows Easy Transfer that's already in Vista (and XP users can download it from Microsoft) that will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again.  It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.

Do you have to do the ""clean"" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs?  Laplink has an offer for $19.95 that will let you use a special version of their program ""PC Mover"" to upgrade one machine one time.  Read the documentation in detail.

The most important thing to doing a ""clean"" install is that in the Upgrade setup you choose ""Custom"".  Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called ""Windows.old"".  PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program will use this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.

I wish I had more space to go into detail here...bottom line is, if you plan ahead a bit, upgrading to 7 will go very easily (and if it doesn't, you'll have something to fall back on).",Plan Before you Buy,1257033600,182,

By the way, the tracker information is stored with the clip, so if you use that same clip in multiple projects, you don't have to re-create your motion tracking.

Customize Motion:  You can now move things like titles, PIP, still images or other objects over the frame with keyframes.

Screen Capture enhancement:  I use this feature instead of something like Camtasia.  Corel has increased frame rates on screen capture from the 15 fps that it used to be, and now allows you to select 25 and 30 fps also.  This should make higher-motion screen captures smoother, and bring it closer to ""Camtasia Quality"".

Ultra HD:  4K Ultra HD is now available, if you can use it.  You will need some higher-end recording and playback equipment to make full use of this though.  Also, render times are much longer for this format.

Stop Motion enhancement:  You can now do stop motion photography directly with your Canon DSLR camera connected to the computer.  VideoStudio shows several camera settings like shutter, exposure, ISO, photo quality, etc.  Before you could only use your webcam of DirectX type device.

Subtitles with voice detection:  You use the usual narration feature to record a voice track for your video.  Then, in the subtitle editor, you can scan the voice track and it will create subtitle sequences based on when you pause in your narration.  You then must still type in the subtitle text or import from a subtitle file.  But the work of creating the subtitle objects at the proper timecodes is done for you.  Now... a voice *recognition* feature (voice-to-text) would be cool in a future version.  ;-)

Of the additional items you get with the ""Ultimate"" version, the included Boris Graffiti v6.1 makes an upgrade even more compelling if you do title animation like type on text, text on a path, jitter and randomization.

So there are several new features that make this version of VideoStudio compelling as an upgrade from X5 and previous.  The screen capture alone makes it useful to me.  Still, I like my Cyberlink PowerDirector for its more organized and intuitive user interface, and its quicker render time.  However for now, I may create some clips in VS X6 and use them in PowerDirector if I want the Motion Tracking or Custom Motion features.",Worth the upgrade,1364428800,2,

The budget randomly adds or subtracts monthly totals - the yearly totals are usually completely wrong. Therefore the budget is not only wrong, but DANGEROUS to USE.

The reports also randomly add or subtract monthly totals. Again, reports are incorrect and useless.

Assuming you even try to use the budget, the new software will lock you out from past months. There is no way to update or correct January's budget in February for example.

I like the new features for unzipping to common directories (I have a number that I routinely am extracting files to) and there's a myriad of features that you may or may not use, like password-protecting zips, creating backups, etc. It's a tad harder to justify paying for this when there are good open source solutions out there now like 7-Zip, not to mention the built-in handling of modern OSes.

1) If you have automatic updates ON, it eats up your bandwidth so you can do NOTHING on the Internet until the update completes. Neat. I thought I purchased my computers to use, not to maintain and I purchased this absolutely worthless product to protect me while I was on the Internet

2) If you have automatic updates OFF (which is the only way you can use it given (1, then you basically have to do the updates manually when you know that you will not be using your computer. Great.

3) I have a half dozen licenses for this product. However, because Windows XP is little more than a continuing security exposure, I only use one computer on this Internet, this one. The ONLY time the other computers are on the Internet is for software updates. Normally, therefore, I only update NIS 2006 on a monthly basis or so (Since it is not needed. If you read 4) & 5) you can see why there is absolutely no incentive to update this product at all since it is just a problem). The problem is that essentially 100% of the time, when I attempt to update NIS 2006, it crashes (Internal error, etc).

4) I live in the sticks so that DSL is not available, therefore I am stuck with dialup. (Satellite is not acceptable for many, many reasons, btw). The consequences of 3), that NIS 2006 always ALWAYS crashes during the update process, is that all updates have to be done piecemeal, one at a time as I try to find some workaround to get it to update. The problem with this, is that even the individual updates fail (Internal error) Therefore I have to spend hours updating each computer: Updates | Select individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. Repeat || Try another individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. So, as I said, I have to spend hours trying to find some workaround for EACH computer trying to get NIS 2006 to ever update.

5) The consequences of 1) and 3), is there is an extremely strong disincentive to update NIS 2006 at all (Besides the fact that every once in awhile your license spontaneously EXPIRES and you have to solve that problem in addition). The end result of this is that I spend far more time trying to update NIS 2006 than I actually spend doing anything productive. (Then there is that wonderful Windows ""Genuine Advantage"", that makes the Windows update process miserable)

6) I would estimate that I end up doing several failed UPDATES, before this piece of junk finally updates, properly. That is a lot of time at 28.8K to 38.6K

There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is ""Certified Associate,"" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.

With this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from ""Adobe Certified Instructors"", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.

For the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a ""test"" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.

Tannenbaum,"More and more, it seems that reviewing new software means addressing two issues: the software proper, and the publisher's distribution model. The most notable example is Adobe's Creative Cloud, which amounts to a subscription-only service that doesn't give users an option to buy the program outright. Microsoft's new distribution model isn't quite so problematic, but it still raises some concerns.

However, the most important part of any software is how it performs, and Office 2013 is a champ in that regard. For some reason, the collective public backlash against all things Microsoft makes it impossible for that company to do anything without taking a ton of harsh scrutiny, so the prospective buyer will doubtless hear about all kinds of problems with Office 2013 (some real, some imagined, some big, some little), but all you need to know is that these are the best and most refined versions ever of this software suite. The ribbon interfaces have been improved and the various applications' new features are, for the most part, sensible and welcome. In particular, PowerPoint is a MUCH better performer, with graphic effects that compete with Apple's Keynote for variety, dazzle and fluidity.

It's hard to know where to start when trying to communicate how the latest version of Office products perform because people have such disparate subsets of experiences with the family of programs (I know plenty of people who still use Office 2003 as their primary productivity tools). As a broad comment, though, these programs are intuitive and feature-packed; they're a logical evolution from earlier iterations, and new users will pick up the basics quickly.

Now onto that distribution model... in a nutshell, the way it works is that when you buy this, you're buying an unlock code that grants you use of one instance of the software. Because you have to download it and activate it online, offline/duplicate activations are essentially impossible. It's Microsoft's way of ensuring that everyone who uses the software pays for it.

Look, the bottom line here is that you either like this approach or you don't. I think it's garbage. I think the reasoning behind such controlled distribution is ideologically wrong-headed, and on top of that, I resent having to be online to get the software I've paid for. I have a studio machine that has never, and will never, be connected to the internet, and I have to use an older version of Office on it.

Having said all that, this is the way Microsoft is going with their wares. It's probably not going to change, and if you want to use their products, this is how you'll do it. There are a number of free or lower-cost alternatives, none of which have all the perks of using Office, but all of which cover the bases of functionality. The bottom line is that prospective buyers should focus on the software experience and not the purchase experience, because if they do it correctly, they'll only have to tangle with it once, and after that, it's all about the user experience.

I suppose that, ultimately, how strongly you feel about the distribution issue will determine whether or not you choose to play Microsoft's game. If you decide to, you'll be rewarded with powerful, intuitive software that, in spite of all its publisher's issues, is still the best in its class.",Five stars for the software; one star for the distribution model,1384992000,,

My youngest daughter was in a ballet recital but a few days before the recital she fell and cut open her head.  That left a nasty wound that the ballet instructor asked us to cover with a minimal band aid.  Needless to say, we could not find a band aid so we tried to brush her hair to the side to cover.  It worked a little but in all the pictures this larger than life cut showed up very prominent.

It just so happened that the software arrived the day before so I loaded it onto my MacBook Pro and without reading through the instructions started playing with the program to see what it could do.  It was very easy to load and I was up and running in about 10 minutes after registering.  I loaded in my pictures and began to work with them, consulting the 114 page user's guide as I was going through the pictures.

After two bad starts I figured out which aspect of the program fixed images and wiped away blemishes and such.  In about 5 minutes I had figured out how to remove the wound from the image and place exact skin tone right over the spot.  I touched it up with a brush feature and then went about brightening their eyes and whitening their teeth, both of which were very easy to figure out without using the guide.

I'd say, Avast (free-of-charge version) is weaker/less intrusive than Kaspersky, while McAfee and Norton are stronger/more intrusive than Kaspersky.

What I want in antivirus software is to be a little safer while browsing the internet and avoid the hassle that a virus causes.  Antivirus software packages will tend to lump in extras, like being able to remotely force your phone to log out of everything in case it's stolen or whatever.  I don't want to deal with that, because I'm not going to figure out how to use those features, so they may as well not exist for me.  Kaspersky has the feature of being able to remotely wipe a smart phone.

The best feature of this particular package is that it can install on several different types of computers, phones, and tablets.  I have a Windows 8 netbook, a Windows 7 computer, and an Android phone.  I also wanted my husband to install this on his iPhone.  I like that for these devices, I only have one software package to deal with and keep up with, in case I want to reinstall or have to go back and find the purchase.  Sadly, I was not able to install this on my Android phone, because I have a really low speced off brand phone and did not have enough available memory for Kaspersky.  My phone is just awful, but I couldn't find minimum software requirements on Kaspersky's website, so that's why the low review.  If minimum specs were available, then it would be my fault for trying to do anything with the cheapest off plan Android I could find.  That aside, I'm glad to have antivirus on my computers.

Amazon has the price for this 5 device protection, as of when I'm writing the review, cheaper than if you buy it from Kaspersky's website.  So, if you want this, Amazon is a good place to get it.

""Ziping"" programs that are out there. I can't recall what version of WinZip I have used most frequently but after using v. 17 I'm very pleased with the changes made to the software and it remains very easy to use and full of new and excellent features.

First things first though:

Setup:
Setting up the software on my Windows 7 machine was very easy. To save anyone a hassle, there is a printed serial number in your DVD case, mine was under the installation instructions on the inside-front of the case. You'll need the number for registration. After installing the application you'll go through the process of registering the software which does ask for a number of personal details such as address, name, etc. but only really requires your serial number and email address. Your email is used to send you a copy of the license or registration code. All in all setup was not bad at all.

--------------------

Use:
The interface of WinZip has changed a lot in the intervening years. The basic layout, however, is easy to navigate and understand even for a novice. The toolbar is laid out in a familiar tabbed form. Each tab containing additional tools and access to settings. My favorite new features are the inclusion of access to cloud storage service such as Google Drive, Dropbox and SkyDrive. I used WinZip 17 for example to compress a 15-minute video I made for my home owners insurance policy and uploaded it to my Google Drive storage all within the WinZip application! You'll of course need to have an account with one (or more) of the cloud storage services and authenticate first.

There are some advanced features here such as building self-extracting '.exe' files, adding document watermarks, encryption. I did not use these features so will refrain from further comment other than to say that they're present for those interested in such.

--------------------

What I like about this software:
(+) Tried and true ""zipping"" utility that does a good job
(+) Version 17 doesn't try to reinvent the wheel just polish what's there and add important and relevant new features
(+) Adding watermarks or converting documents to PDF is very, very easy
(+) Wondering just how much space you're actually saving by Zipping that file?... now each job features a memory report on how much memory is saved!

--------------------

What I don't like about this software:
(-) Some of the features require upgrading to the ""Pro"" version or require additional monthly fees - such as the FTP feature

--------------------

Bottom-line:
Corel has done a great job with WinZip. There is something here for old and new users alike. The inclusion of cloud-storage integration makes this a great product.","Long Time User, First Time Owner",1368835200,,

I recently had my will (and associated documents) updated at my local Legal Affairs office (I'm retired military) in anticipation of a very serious bit of surgery. Fortunately, all went well and all the docs we had prepared can go back into storage until our next review date (or need).

The documents that were generated for me by the Legal Affairs office were comprehensive and both my wife and I were pleased. In the event something unfortunate had happened we were well-prepared and legally-armed to deal with what may have come.

Surgery in the rear view mirror and now on the road to hopefully a relatively full recovery I finally have had the opportunity to go through and try Quicken WillMaker 2014. All I can say is that I am amazed. Absolutely comprehensive, it not only generates the documents provided by the Legal Affairs office, it also generates a checklist for caregivers and survivors that floored me and my wife as to its thoroughness. The generated ""final arrangements"" document is also superior to what I had thought was an already superior ""final instructions"" document prepared by Legal Affairs.

Certainly, if you are using this software to generate a legally-binding will (or other document) and are concerned about the validity of the document (or are annoyed because your locality will not accept it/them as legally-binding), you might arrive at a different conclusion than I have. But my wife and I are using this program to be better educated and prepared the next time we update our wills (whether we choose to use a lawyer or once again avail ourselves of the local Legal Affairs folks). Bottom line, I've paid far more money for a specialty book on subjects like this and gotten far less information than is provided by this product.

The program also comes with an abridged ""Legal Answer Book For Families"" (paperback), a downloadable .pdf ""NOLO Encyclopedia of Everyday Law"" (following a fair and unobtrusive registration process), and one year's on-line access to tools that can be used to create a living trust.

I was VERY disappointed in how horribly slow it was to load and to save files.  I was about to give up when I decided to search once more for a fix on the Corel site and I did find the problem.  This is the fix:

  Question

In some cases, if Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or Snapfire Plus was installed or is currently installed on the same computer system as Paint Shop Pro Photo X2, you may experience slow performance when saving files. This behavior may be related to issues with the database files used by all of these programs.
  Answer

The following two sets of instructions may resolve this behavior and allow for proper file saving speed.

Set #1

Do the following to delete the Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Database files. The program will recreate the files upon next launch. First Close Paint Shop Pro Photo X2  if is it running.
1.  Go to Start | Run, Type %temp% and click Ok. (on Vista, click Start button, then highlight Start Search. Type %temp% and then push enter on keyboard)
2.  On the Windows Explorer Tool bar, Click the Up Folder button. The Up Folder button looks like a folder with a green arrow pointing up. If you don't see it, Click View | Go to | Up one level.  (On Vista, click Organize | Layout | Menu bar. Once displayed, go to View | Go to | Up one level).
3.  (on Vista skip to step 4) On XP, Double click on the Application data folder. NOTE: The Application Data folder is a hidden folder. Make sure you have enabled viewing of Hidden files and folders to see this folder.  We have included instructions* below for enabling this view.
4.  Double-click on the Corel folder.
5.  Delete all files and folders in the Corel folder.

* To enable viewing hidden files and folders do the following:
1. Go to Tools | Folder Options.
2. Click on View tab.
3. In the large white area marked Advanced settings, check the ""Show Hidden Files and folders"" radio button.
4. Click OK to accept this setting. You should now see the Application data folder as described above.

Set #2

Do the following to delete the old Paint Shop Pro Photo XI Database files (this is a critical step).
1.  Go to Start | Run, (on Vista, click Start button, then highlight Start Search)
2  Type %appdata% and click Ok (on Vista, push Enter key on keyboard).
3.  Double-click on the Corel folder.
4.  Delete the following files.  If you do not see all of these files, delete all of these files that you do see.
  ImageDB.db
  LastDBFilter. PspCache
  LastDBTreeSel. PspCache
  thumbnails.db
5. . Delete the Paint Shop Pro Photo folder and then close this window.

NOTE: if you receive any prompts about not being able to delete specific files (being used by another program, etc), restart the computer, then try deleting the file again.

Try running Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 again after deleting all files from above procedure. Try saving a file and note if the behavior continues.

If this corrects the behavior, then we recommend no longer running Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or Snapfire Plus on this computer system. Instead we recommend using Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 and Corel MediaOne (this is the updated version of Snapfire Plus).",PSP X2 Was Slow to Load and Save - I found the fix,1256515200,6,

The look and feel of Office 2013 is a lot more streamlined and simplified, even though it has a busy look to it (I think because they've changed the screens to almost all white and made the buttons bigger).  So far I've found it has streamlined well, transitioning and updating itself fluidly.  Excel has a new look when updating a cell, showing at the same time the cells that it is updating at the same time with a quick downward motion of the numbers.  Outlook creates reply emails straight in the email without opening a new screen, making for quicker and easier use.  The icon on the taskbar displays a small envelope when you have mail, which is a nice touch.

I think the only major con is the horrible DRM that they have on it.  Originally they made it so that you could install only once.  Your computer crashes too bad.  They switched it once the outcry was loud enough so that you can re-download every 90 days, which is better but still not good.  What if I install and computer crashes, then I have to wait 90 days, all the while not being able to use the programs (this was the last I had heard of the DRM, so if MS has changed it again please let me know).  That being said I will be keeping my 2003 handy just in case I need it in a pinch.

- install seamlessly (I run Windows 7 64bit), I want no problems, hicoughs or gliches
- I want a small footprint, not a system resource hog
- I want the product to run in the background the vast majority of the time and be relatively unnoticed unless I want to interact with the product

The software has become more stable over the years, not crashing quite so much.  It's also much faster at editing and rendering than ever before.

The only negative thing about PowerDirector 10 Ultra is the loss of the randomness of the Movie Magic Wizard.  In version 6, I was able to select the entire library of contents and a time frame for the movie and the wizard would spit out a movie with random photos and videos from the library cut to fit the time allotted.  In version 9, the movie wizard would cram every pic and video in the exact order they appear in the library into my movie -- sped up to a dizzying pace when I elected to have a very short movie.  Version 10 is a little better.  It does speed up the pics to fit the movie but I also noticed some videos were left out if there wasn't enough time.  I can also quickly rearrange the photos and videos after the wizard is done and have the wizard redo the movie, which is better than having to go back to the library to rearrange everything.

After making my video via the wizard, I then tamper with it in the main screen.  That's the beauty of having a powerful editor coupled with the wizard.  We get simplicity and versatility in one.  I can add and subtract from the movie.  Of course, movies can be made without the wizard.  I choose not to.

Smartsound is nice.  I've never used it before because it didn't work well, but it does now.  Basically, it's a whole library of music that plays in some sort of endless loop that I can use for my videos.  I can just tell it how long the video is and the music will automatically be adjusted to fit the timeline.  The library is fairly large, including a wide variety of music and some sound effects such as animal sounds and footsteps.  I can usually find something appropriate.  We also have the option of using our own music and capturing our own sounds.

Rendering is quick and easy.  Whereas in the past, this was where my computer would crash and burn, it no longer does.  I like being able to render the video into so many different formats.  I can even make it 3-D, and the box comes with a pair of 3-D glasses just in case I feel the desire to do so.  I can automatically publish it to YouTube or Facebook and a copy of the video stays on my hard drive.  It's so simple, I've already placed a few videos on YouTube over the last couple of days.

Overall, I like this version very much.  It's faster and more stable than ever before, and the Smartsound works.  Just hoping they'll fix the Magic Movie Wizard to be like it was in version 6 and everything would be perfect.

The word, ""forced"" means slightly different things to different people. To some, forced means that you are being threatened of being dropped into a live volcano. To others, forced means there are no viable options.  The latter definition is what I mean.

I had been successfully using Office 2011 on 3 different computers.  I purchased a physical disc, (always the best way to buy software) from Amazon. The disc that I purchased included 3, Installs.

Shockingly, (and uniquely) if you upgrade, or otherwise must change your hard drive on your computer that counts as a NEW installation to Microsoft!  So, when my mechanical hard drive started showing signs of difficulty I replaced it with a solid-state drive. This only takes about 30 seconds on a Mac Pro tower.

About 40 different applications all worked perfectly and flawlessly after installing the new hard drive, EXCEPT for Microsoft Office.  ONLY Microsoft asked again for my software key. I have this key, but it would not work.  I spent about 2 hours with Microsoft trying to get the key to work.  I was told I had to RE-PURCHASE Office.

With Apple, once you purchase their software you can reinstall it as needed over and over again without limit.  With Microsoft, any repair or upgrade to your computer is likely to result in your software becoming useless.  Also, with subscription-based software, you are totally dependent upon the company's existence, and support of that software in order to continue using it.

Also, after installing Office 365 I learned that it defaulted to saving MY files on Microsoft servers. For security and privacy reasons I do not want to use the cloud at all. It appears, there is no way to shut off my Microsoft cloud account. (Yes, there is a way to save the document locally, assuming you remember to do this.)

I am aware of the various free options to Microsoft Office.  Some people are happy with these, others are not, I did not consider this to be a viable option.  I consider Microsofts installation policy to be anti-consumer and hyper unfriendly.

noire of this classic program. Up until versions 11 and 12 it appeared that the makers of Roxio Creator have played around with the configuration of this excellent product
sometimes to its own detriment. The current owners Corel have packaged Creator NXT with paint shop Pro making this an invaluable purchase for anyone wanting to edit pictures
video and audio.
 The structure of the software follows the traditional format that Roxio has always done which is to base the home tab with all of the capabilities. I found that this
was a good way to start, and an easy way to incorporate the new elements; Corel has obviously learned from some classic software blunders and they have kept the essential
structure of a great program. The picture capabilities as well as the video capabilities are very advanced. I easily found the classic capabilities of editing photos, editing
videos, and many parts of the program that I've used in versions up to seven and eight of Roxio Creator. As someone coming from the older version where Roxio did primarily
audio tasks and a collection of video tasks, the additional capabilities take a little getting used to but in the format that Roxio works virtually all of the tasks can be
picked up easily, either through general use or the help section they call the learning Center. The additional capabilities look very similar to some of the Avid software that
I have used, but they have the generally easier format which Roxio brings to the party. Special mention to the CD and audio creation section, which has some excellent
capabilities: one great advantage in the audio section is the ability to turn vinyl into excellent digital files, and you can do that with a Roxio product all with some
general cables that you can get at Amazon. As the case in the audio section, the ability to process and enhance audio files is superb. The disc burning section is fully
compatible with CD, DVD, Blu-ray in all respects: the tasks it can perform I once again high-value, but they have that same Roxio ease of use.
 I'm not a big fan of their card, poster, ""Hallmark moments"" type of cards, calendars, however you can take pictures of any kind, edit them for maximum effect, even
brush up old and damaged pictures, to make some eye-popping pictures and calendars.
 Whilst I have found Roxio NXT to be generally useful and thoroughly amazing, in-line with my previous experience with Roxio, my main suggestion about service and
support is that if you want to do something do NOT call the so-called help and service number, what some people used to call product support for Roxio. I attempted to use the
convert file to video DVD function and found that I had to call the support number, or should I say email ultimately, since the product support numbers require a convoluted
series of numbers just to get you to the starting point where they will refer you to a useless webpage. About the best thing I can suggest with the copy and convert section is
that you look up in the learning Center to find out what can be converted to the main type of files. The main issue I have with support is that the MP4 file I wanted to
convert was all I was asking about, and it took days for support to work out that my question which I repeated in each email was something that the convert subprogram did not
do. This is not a big issue when you consider just how many types of files that Roxio NXT can deal with, and it is quite a lot, but I really got to the point that I felt the
so-called support technicians did not know their product. Anyway, my verdict is that the program is excellent, it does an amazing variety of tasks and it has that classic
Roxio ease of use: and if you really want to it has a very easy to use interface with the cloud, not that I'm recommending use the cloud :-).",Creator par excellence,1372550400,2,

Lots of features, extras, and massive platform to do almost any home or semi-pro project. The problems with previous Pinnacle is the lack of multithread and 64 bit integration, and choppy rendering during the editing process. The Pinnacle 18 has 64 bit architecture and utilizes your computer's juice to it's fullest potential.

Installation - Took far too long. 30 minutes for installation in this optimized day in age? A non-factor, but something worth noting.

Interface-  Intuitive, easy to drag and drop, cut, selecting frames.

Rending Capability - While it is built for CUDA (Nvidia Graphics cards), my AMD Radeon card still was able to lend some juice to rendering.

Editing - Drag and drop, snip snip, import video. Relatively easy to pick up. Not being able to just drag a video from the outside is annoying. I have to import the video into the Pinnacle ecosystem before playing with it. The editing tool for video is superb. Change lighting, exposure, overlay image or text - this is like photoshop/lightroom for video editing.

Live Screen Capture - Simply a win. No more searching for that right screen capture software. Integrated, easy to use, spectacular convenience.

What I love is that recording both the video and audio (program sounds) is seamless. Not many recording programs provide this feature. Usually, you would need to use an external recording device to overlay any audio.

Features and extras - My golly. Royalty free soundtracks, endless list of transitions and effects, countless plugins. I personally don't need them all, but you will probably find a diamond in the bucket. It can be quite a headache to surf through all those transitions and effects. Look through them all thoroughly a couple times, bookmark your favorites, and save yourself time in your video editing regime.

The Pinnacle Studio 18 jumped leaps in and bounds and showed promise with the revamped 64 bit architecture and usual plethora of features. It is far from perfect, but it does give you all the tools for home or semi-pro production. If you want to cut the crap (plugins, extras), and you do like the Pinnacle Studio's ease of use, already solid collection of transitions and effects, go with the Pinnacle regular or plus versions.

It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

With low overhead in processor & memory use, along with some impressive features Kaspersky was the best in class as far as I was concerned.

Trend Micro's Maximum Security has done the dirty deed. I am now an unabashed fan of it. Interestingly, you will get the product in a box but there will not be a disc, instead you'll have a link to download it. It's not a massive package so download is quick. Trend Micro explains that they do this for a few good reasons (and I mostly agree): most laptops don't have CD/DVD drives anymore, for starters.

Installation is quick and you're off to the races--it nicely handled uninstalling my Kaspersky product without issue. Now, in addition to the anti-virus software, there are other bits of software that I would normally discount, but that I have found quite useful: a password safe, which I quickly tested and found functional but then uninstalled the Chrome add-on because I use the excellent LastPass. A social media management system that reviews your Social Media accounts and suggests privacy enhancing configuration changes. This is quite nice and I appreciate it, but there are some brain-dead suggestions it gives, such as setting your twitter feed to private, which kind of goes against the idea of twitter. A site link checker which highlights in green any link it finds to be good before you click on it--and it does this cleanly and without imposing on system resources or making a mess out of the web page formatting.

With next-to-no CPU and memory overhead, Trend sits there unnoticed except for notifications on startup that it is running. You will not be hampered in any way by it, which I love and absolutely require. By the way, this is running on a Windows 10 laptop, but I am given to understand you can also install it on Android devices as well, which counts towards the 3-user license. I have not installed it on my phone or any other device so I can't say anything about that.

The usual features are there, and intuitive to use: scheduled scans, parental controls (which I don't need or use) and configuration settings for what to do when malware is found. All in all, this is my new favorite security software.

[Update: I have installed this on my Android phone and I am amazed at how well it's doing there as well. Low to no overhead, though I found it annoying that I had to change its configuration to remove the rather obnoxious ""YOU ARE NOW PROTECTED"" message & logo resident on the home screen. It pointed out what it thought were privacy concerns and did not find any threats. It does perform a threat analysis with every new installation as well. You can also use this as a remote wipe interface in case you lose the phone.

More new features on the PC edition: I also happen to like the secure delete feature, the vault--for keeping sensitive files with a unique feature of locking the vault if ever your PC is lost or stolen. Capital idea!

Now for the reason I've taken down the review from five to four stars: for the price, you should be getting a firewall, but what comes with the so-called ""Maximum"" edition is an ""enhancement"" to the built-in Windows firewall.]","Surprisingly Useful Add-On Features, Excellent Protection [Update]",1457827200,2,

Microsoft should've provided some discount for prior Vista Ultimate customers at least.
Charging an extra $200 or more for a couple of features that noone will use and some outdated ones like Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications is just plain tacky.
The only one that really adds any value is the new feature called ""VHD Boot"". With that you can boot your entire Windows out of a Virtual Hard Disk file as those used with Virtual PC or Virtual Server which can come in handy if you are a developer or like to install alot of beta products or games and want to make sure you don't screw up your main install.
Anyways, having upgraded my overpriced install of Vista Ultimate 64 bits the first thing you notice is that Microsoft actually downgrades you by removing the few Ultimate extras they did provide with Vista!
That's right Windows7 doesn't merely tell you it won't deliver another DreamScene content pack but that it's going to take away the ones you already had including Tinker, come on, Microsoft, that's just mean. After removing your Vista extras the upgrade form Vista goes smooth for the most part. I just had to reinstall drivers for my netgear wireless usb which Win7 couldn't find or provide. XP users are totally out of luck though since they will have to do a clean install and reinstall all their programs.
Other than the fact that Windows 7 forcibly removes your extras if you are already running Vista I wouldn't be in a rush to go out and grab a copy, especially not at the current price, since the improvements are little and subtle coming from Vista. If you are still running XP on the otherhand though you should've definitely upgrade asap.
I've used the bitlocker feature on a 2TB drive and it works as advertised and that's one area where the improvement compared to Vista are noticeable. For one you know longer have to create your own partition to install bitlocker since windows 7 takes care of it for you but it still takes forever to encrypt a 2TB drive, roughly several hours, but at least it's a one time deal unless you need to decrypt it to clone it or update your bios for example.
If you are trying to scrimp on hardrive space or memory Win7 does use a bit less than Vista but still more than XP, since Movie maker, mail, and several other programs that always used to come with Windows have been removed and are now a optional download. That won't make the few people that use or depend on those programs happy but for the rest I'm sure they are happier for a slimmer Windows. The other changes people upgrading from Vista will notice is the annoying sidebar is gone and the taskbar is huge and works way different than Vista so it takes some learning to figure out where Microsoft moved everything to. It took me a while to figure out where all my stuff went since Win7 tries to be helpful and hide more stuff from you like Macos x. For example your taskbar notifications are still there but hidden by default. Nothing else really impressed me since almost all the stuff in Win7 was already there in Vista. Problem Step Recorder is a nice addition for those that help others troubleshoot their computers or is a quick and dirty way to make your own tutorials. And contrary to what others are seeing Win7 is not noticeably faster than Vista for most stuff except maybe networking and hibernation does seem to work better now. Then again since it never seemed to work before now that it does work is certainly an improvement. Windows 7 is also alot more helpful in trying to troubleshoot incompatible applications and games since a little wizard pops up trying to help you but if your program/game didn't work in Vista it most likely isn't going to work in Win7 either. Oh and another thing I turned off right away was Aero snap since it kept trying to be helpful by rearranging my windows for me which I hated. Alot of others seem to love this feature though. Other little things that Microsoft finally got around to adding to Windows is native burn support for ISO so you don't have to install Nero, usually one of the first pieces of software I install, and Blu-ray burn only support. This still doesn't make up for the lack of virtual desktops support, which Linux and Mac OS X have provided for the longest time and is one of the most useful features ever devised. This is one of the biggest oversight Microsoft continues to make which each new release. Maybe if they threw in native Blu-ray playback support for the Ultimate edition it would make sense to charge more.
So that's my take from someone that used Vista since the day it was released and has been using Win7 since it was released roughly a month ago.
Oh and finally I'm not too happy that even this latest more secure version of Windows can easily be rendered non-functional just by installing an old game. Any old game that using StarForce will install a driver that will immediately cause a blue screen of death upon reboot.

""Please note that it's not possible to restore system state backup that way. In order to restore it, you need to run Acronis True Image 11 Home in Windows Environment, then choose this backup archive from Acronis Secure Zone and proceed with restoration.""

I will review this in terms of changes that I have become aware of, and the overall quality of the product.
Word 2010
1. Ease of Setup:  Unlike the bad old days of putting programs on the hard drive, this program came on a single DVD disk.  As I had a previous version of Word, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade the program - which I did.  It took about 10 minutes for the process to be completed. Overall this was very fast.
2. Program:  if you are used to Word 2003 or earlier, the user interface is quite different.  More choices appear as tabs, rather than the older style.  This certainly takes some getting used to as you will have to locate where a certain tool might be located.
3. Visual: I believe that the aesthetic is quite nice.  The look overall of the program, once you become more familiar with the layout, is actually more simple and elegant.  It does take some adjustment from previous versions like Word 2003, but I now find this version much easier to use.  I also believe it is more intuitive for the user.
Other programs:
The Office Professional Suite adds Excel, Outlook, Publisher, Access and Power Point in addition to Word.
From the visual standpoint, the same tab system that is used in Word is applied here to the other programs.
Power Point
Power Point is a powerful program that allows the user to put together nice slide show presentations.  Here, PowerPoint 2010 adds the tabs across the screen.  This is a huge improvement over the 2007 version as it seems that the many features of PowerPoint are more easily located.  I very much appreciate that it is far easier to set up new slides in the presentation and locate all the different features that were previously more difficult to locate.  This program is a huge improvement over previous versions and I think most users will be very happy with the new more intuitive approach.
Excel
Again, this version is a significant improvement over previous versions of Excel, including the 2007 version.  Instead of previous versions which made the user locate the pull down window which may have held the required options, Excel 2010 has tabs that only require the user to go to the logical place where the desired option would be located and do the required task.
I believe that this version of Excel is probably the easiest and most intuitive version I have ever used of this powerful program.
Outlook
As above, I believe that this version of Outlook is far better and easier to deal with than previous versions I have used.  Set-up is much easier with a far more guided experience than previous versions that seemed to depend on the user know certain bits of information.  Here, the set-up program just asks for the desired e-mail address and password, and it seeks to set up the information itself.  This is a little but appreciated update, because on my previous 2003 version, set-up was so frustrating that I had to try over multiple sessions.
Overall, I believe that this is a superior version of Outlook and I look forward to giving more updates as I go through more of this program.

Conclusions:
I believe that Office 2010 is a tremendous improvement over previous versions.  If you are using Office 2003 or earlier, than I think this is a major improvement and a necessary purchase.  If you have Office 2007, then I believe that this is not such a vast improvement that you must upgrade this version.

Overall, I was not initially impressed with the vast suite of programs.  Yet, on more continuous use, I believe that Microsoft has vastly improved the Office canon.  Believe me, at first you will curse and scream in agony over the choices that have been made.  Where is my favorite tool or feature that was supposedly upgraded you will as over and over.  You will certainly consider yourself to be stupid for making the purchase.  But, if you stick with these programs, you will eventually use it and believe it makes a great deal of sense and begin to become proficient with the programs.  In other words, there is a significant learning curve with these programs.  If you understand this and give it time, I believe that you will, like me, learn to appreciate what has been put into the Office suite.","A significant learning curve, but a great improvement over previous versions.",1290988800,3,

Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have ever had the misfortune of working with.  This is coming from someone that has used Windows ME and Vista.  I don't know what Microsoft was thinking in releasing OS or if they were even thinking at all. But apparently they only care about the ""next big thing"", and care nothing about people who actually use their software.  They also apparently don't have a QA department because I find it very hard to believe that any sane person would sign off on an OS with so many usability problems and bugs.  I don't know where to begin but to get started I will just take excerpts from an opinion I wrote about Windows 8 on another website and go from there.

Windows 8 was clearly designed for a touchscreen, but not every one wants touchscreen, and not every windows application is compatible with touch screen. Users should not be forced to buy a computer that has touch screen just so they can use Windows 8. Windows 8 might work well on a tablet or phone, but it sucks as a desktop OS however Microsoft seems hell bent on shoving touch screen down our throats.  If people wanted a tablet or a phone, then guess what?  They would BUY a tablet or a phone.  Why try to force an OS designed for tablets or phones onto a desktop or laptop?

To my surprise Windows 7 ended up being a pretty good OS and I use it at work and many people also like Windows 7. However Microsoft had to go and ASSUME (like they always do) that we all want touch screen now and remove everything that worked so well in previous OS's.  i.e. the start button.  Pressing the windows key on Windows 8 will not bring up the start menu, but instead it will bring you to a poorly designed screen with stupid tiles every where making finding what you want a tedious task.  They hid everything from you and many times you have to search the web to get help to find what you are looking for.

Touch screen is stupid for a desktop or laptop computer. The tiles, metro UI, or whatever you call it is idiotic and makes working in the OS an absolute nightmare. I couldn't care less about stupid teeny bopper Facebook or other social media crap. I just want to do what I need to do on the computer and not have to go through menu after menu of Nickelodeon type tiles just do a simple task. This OS isn't about productivity, its about pretty colors, and Facebook status updates. Microsoft seemed to forget people actually do WORK on their computers.  For example I VPN to my work network to work from home occasionally and I need remote desktop connection to connect to the many servers I use at work.  However because Windows 8 is so poorly designed, instead of just double clicking the mstsc application to open a new window, now double clicking it just brings up the existing connection, meaning I have to again search for the mstsc app, right click it and then click open new connection.  This takes a lot of time especially when I'm working on 3, 4, or 5 servers at the same time.  Even stuff like configuring a printer or getting into the control panel is an exercise in hair pulling frustration.  Switching between windows which what 99.999% of people who actually do WORK on a laptop do, is extremely cumbersome basically eliminating any hope of productivity.  Heck even turning the damn thing off, or logging a user off is made unnecessarily complicated. Who ever designed this OS or thought people would actually like this mess needs to be fired and banned from ever designing an OS again.

Luckily the only computer in my household that had this turd of an operating system was my son's laptop.  But low and behold Windows 8 crashed for the 2nd time and now won't let me back in thanks to the endless ""We are automatically repairing your PC"". loop.  The automatic repair is just as useful as Window's assistant in previous operating systems.  Now I can't get into Windows at all so all the stuff is now gone.  Luckily I had the foresight not to put any important files on this computer so I really don't lose anything.  I'm writing this review on my Windows XP laptop I bought nearly 6 years ago, and other than a few hardware issues, the operating system itself has been pretty solid, which is much more than I can say about Windows 8.  Today I'm going to install Windows XP on my son's laptop and be done with it.  I should have done this as soon as my son got this laptop and I wouldn't be going through this today.

Windows 8 is the reason I will never buy another laptop unless it comes with Windows 7. In addition, I will never even consider purchasing a Windows Tablet or a Windows phone. Words simply can't express how much I hate, loathe, despise, detest, abhor this operating system.

If you just wanna surf the net, use Office applications, and do basic things, XP is the only upgrade to consider from Win95 or Win98.

Johnson,"While in middle school and high school we were required to take a foreign language course, so I ended up taking French, Spanish, and Japanese. Eventually French was the only one I continued through high school and eventually college.  Since then, I have never had a need to use French so I have pretty much forgotten all I've learned.  I later realized Spanish was a language I could have use for today, but my past Spanish computer courses I've purchases not helpful at all and downright boring.  RosettaStone was going to be my next purchase until I saw the price; much more expensive than I expected it to be.  I eventually planned on getting it, but not anytime in the foreseeable future.  I had an opportunity to try and keep the Spanish version of RosettaStone so you can image I jumped on the opportunity quickly.

As I am going through Level 1 of the three level course, I am finding out already that I am enjoying RosettaStone's approach to learning as opposed to the other courses I have had.  RosettaStone uses a ""Dynamic Immersion"" approach which basically teaches you the language very similar to the way you learned your first language.  After the very first lesson I found myself being able to associate everyday objects with the things I learned in the language.  More importantly it seems to stick.  My high school French teacher taught us that repetition is the key to learning a new language and if you don't use it then you will lose it.  RosettaStone follows this same principle; at the beginning of every lesson the software always goes over what you've learned in the previous lessons to reinforce what you've learned.  It also comes with audio companion CD's you can listen to in your car or at work that will also go over with what has been learned.

The RosettaStone software focuses on four major areas; reading, speaking, writing, and vocabulary.  Most of the reading and vocabulary exercises require you matching up pictures up with what the speaker says and what displays on the screen.  Pronunciation exercises require you to repeat what the speaker says with the provided USB Headphones/microphone.  Writing exercises require you to write/spell in Spanish using the on screen keyboard.  The software even comes with stickers you can place over your existing keyboard to make typing easier.  RosettaStone is very visual which is important to learning a new language.  From what I have observed, RosettaStone does not use translations at all. Instead, with the aid of visual references it actually teaches Spanish independent of your native language.  So instead of trying to remember ""una manzana"" = apple or ""un huevo"" = egg, you are taught to associate the word, phrase, or sentence with a mental picture which I think makes things stick.  Keep in mind this is just one example of how RosettaStone teaches you your new language.

Honestly, after going through to first few lessons, while I agreed I was learning, I didn't think I was learning THAT much, however that view changed when the software required me to identify objects and phrases on the screen by spelling them without any help from the speaker.  I thought I would fail the lesson, but I surprised myself; ending up getting all but one correct.  It was as if I was doing the activity subconsciously.

My only real complaint was the poor customer service experience I had when calling RosettaStone Customer Support to inform them that the Spanish Keyboard stickers were printed incorrectly.  On Spanish keyboards pressing Shift + a number 4 - 0 will produce a different character than an English keyboard:

On a Spanish Keyboard, pressing shift in conjunction with numbers 4 - 0 should produce the following characters:

Shift + 4 = ""$""
Shift + 5 = ""%""
Shift + 6 = ""&""
Shift + 7 = ""/""
Shift + 8 = ""(""
Shift + 9 = "")""
Shift + 0 = ""=""

However the Spanish stickers included with RosettaStone are printed as:

Shift + 4 = ""%""
Shift + 5 = ""&""
Shift + 6 = ""/""
Shift + 7 = ""(""
Shift + 8 = "")""
Shift + 9 = ""=""
Shift + 0 =

After being on hold for nearly 20 minutes, I finally get to a live person, I tried to explain the issue to the customer service rep, but this guy was completely clueless on what I was talking about and the only solution was for me to press the shift button...ok.  Before getting too involved with a long drawn out frustrating conversation, I asked to speak to someone else.  He transfers me and again I am on hold for a long period of time before speaking to a ""senior technical rep"" I tell her the issue and she tells me that she can just have RosettaStone send me more keyboard stickers.  I am transferred again, and yet again am on hold for a while.  When speaking to the new person, she informs me that RosettaStone does NOT send out the stickers separately, but suggested I buy some from another company for $12.  When I tell her that the keyboard stickers are printed incorrectly she says she would bring it to someone's attention...yeah right.  After wasting nearly an hour with RosettaStone Customer Support I hung up more dissatisfied then I was when I first called.  In fact the original issue wasn't really a big of a deal, but I felt the need to let someone know so they could fix it for future customers; but instead, I get bad customer service.  I eventually fixed the stickers myself with the help of a razor, simply putting the symbols above the numbers in their correct places.

Other than the bad customer service experience, my only concern right now is that the course may be rather short even though it's three levels.  I am still very early in the course so perhaps that may not be a concern at all.  Also since I am very early in the course, there is no way I can honestly say if it's worth the hefty price tag, but I will say I am very impressed so far, and am very eager to continue my learning.  However be aware if you need to call customer support that you will be on hold for a while and there is no guarantee that they will even be able to help you plus they are not the most polite people I have had to deal with but hopefully you won't even have to deal with them.

Independent of the customer service I'll give it a rounded up value of 5, but the bad customer service experience is something I can't ignore, so for that it gets a 4.",Surprisingly efficient approach to learning; customer service could use some work,1217548800,19,

Photoshop is a graphics editing program in which (among other things) you can create, edit and extensively modify digital images. Photoshop has a monstrous learning curve with hundreds of features and functions. When it comes to graphics editing programs, aphotoshop is not only king of the hill, but it is the hill itself.

 PhotoDirector is a completely different animal. Its publisher describes it as a tool that permits you to manage and adjust your digital photos. It is simply not a competitor to Adobe Photoshop, open source GIP or Corel PaintShop Pro. It doesnt pretend to be. It does however compete well with Adobe Lightroom. Many people call these type of applications workflow programs. You start with organizing your images, adjust the color, composition, add effects, prepare them for output and output them in an orderly fashion with tools that are provided for you.

 In short, PhotoDirector is primarily an image adjustment program and a pretty good one at that.

 It has a moderately steep learning curve. Regrettably most people will ignore the 18 page manual included in the boxed version. Too bad because it is quite informative and a single read would leave the first-time user much better equipped to get the most out of PhotoDirector. The manual is also available at any stage within the program by simply pressing the F! key. Again, far too many people will never figure that out: they don't need no stinking manuals  and instead become angry with the program because they cant figure out how to perform the simplest function.

 The program divides workflow into five descriptively named stages: Library, Adjustment, Edit, Slideshow and Print. The guts of the program are in the Adjustment and Edit modules. In the Adjustment module you are greeted with an initially confusing array of adjustments that you can apple manually and incrementally. For nearly all hobby photographers this module will all they need most of the time for cropping and adjusting colors, lens aberrations and so one. The manual adjustments pane can be very, very intimidating at first because it contains very powerful tools. Adjustments are always non-destructive unless you make a really bad mistake and Save them. There is also a wide range of presets where all the tedious work has been done for you. They are previewed in a small window as you browse them and be further adjusted manually once you apply them. Unique to CyberLink is an online library where you can download additional presets from a huge library of user supplied contributions.

 The Edit modules provides somewhat limited image modification capabilities such as patching, background and content aware removal, simulated HDR and other effects. Useful overall.

 The Slideshow and Print modules allow you to finish your image adjustment work. There are vastly more powerful specialty programs for these functions, but these modules will be more than adequate for most.

 Overall, for the user understands that this is not a competitor to Photoshop, but an image adjustment tool, PhotoDirector will serve them well.

This is the second edition of Peachtree (now Sage) Accounting I have worked with and it remains a quality product (I can't say superior because I have never worked with QuickBooks or any other of Sage's competitors). It seems to have everything a home or small business owner (HSBO) needs to keep the books balanced (it may be even more powerful than that, but my experience is at the HSBO level). In this regard, it's at least a 4-star product. I appreciated the introductory tutorials such that the software is far more accessible and easy to use that it would seem at first look. It remains my choice of accounting software.

But I have several concerns/complaints. First, the interface looks as if we were still living in a Windows 95 world. Surely for the price Sage can spend some time updating what is an absolutely archaic looking interface. Second, let's take a look at the price. $550? That's a chunk of change (I'm thinking of the irony of how red this item's entry will look int the HSBO ledger book as a result of this purchase)! I have a sneaky suspicion why the high price: Sage will transition to a subscription model that allows users to ""rent"" the software for a specified period of time and $550 will be the benchmark against which Sage will price the subscription rates.

Third, I really dislike the sneaky way Sage gets the user to participate in the ""anonymous"" data/statistics-gathering program software companies employ to keep an eye on their products. I was presented with a screen that said I was selected to participate in this program and could not move forward without agreeing. Though there is a way to opt out, it is a very convoluted progress getting there. I was not pleased and neither should you be.

As of this writing, two other reviewers have opined on the software and offer great observations. I think we are generally in accord with what this software offers: its benefits and annoyances. As such, I encourage potential buyers to look at their comments.

I had Norton 6 (I believe) and loved it.  It was small, simple, effective.  I used the full Norton software on later PCs and found them to be bloated and memory hogging.  Not worth the money I paid for them at all.

Enter Norton 360.

I do appreciate the more silent footprint of this new Norton, however, all they did was lessen the GUI's presence.  The bloat is still there, you just don't see it.  Take a simple virus scan for example: I have a dualcore Centrino laptop and just a virus scan brought the poor thing to its knees.  Unacceptable.  Also, the cleanup works TOO well, essentially making Firefox ""forget"" everything even when you tell it not to.

The straw: the heuristic virus protection.  It blocks websites that are in no way dangers to your computer, and deletes software programs that are just updates or patches (not warez).  It assumes something must be dangerous just because it opens a port to function - guess what?  A lot of software might need to do that, including some of Microsoft's own.  It's no big deal.  IT doesn't even prompt you first, it just takes action.

There is always a learning curve with any serious software product where you tweak the settings, learn what combination works well for you, and so on. I really feel a serious package like this should be tested out for many weeks - not days - before a decision is made about it.

I run Norton 360 on my main home PC, from which I run several websites. This means I am running database development software, graphic editing software, video editing software, logging software and much more on this machine. Plus I'm a game reviewer, so I'm running some pretty intensive games on it as well. My machine does a great variety of things. You would think if an issue was going to trigger, that I'd probably trigger it.

I definitely agree that you need to spend a little time setting up the software to work well with your surfing and net patterns. Someone who does a lot of networking operations might need ports more open than someone who just reads email and wants their computer locked up tightly. Now, that being said, the interface is rather straightforward to do this. Once you set it up, you're all set.

I haven't run into any issues with Norton 360 once it was set up well. Yes I had to do some tweaking to get my various POP mail accounts working - many of which are customized and using non-standard ports. It was a one time operation, and has been set since then.

In terms of the quality of the anti-virus software, I always give Norton very high marks. Our cable company provided free anti-virus software as part of our cable bill. Virusses got right through their ""shield"". When I put on Norton, Norton instantly spotted those virusses and eliminated them without any fuss.

I completely agree that some systems out there might have issues with this software package, just like some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. Where an XBox 360 is a perfect clone of every other XBox 360 out there, every PC is unique. Every person has different internet settings, different mail software, and perhaps most importantly, different virusses and spyware that have snuck on your system. Undoubtedly there is always going to be some unique blend of these things that causes a system to crash - with OR without Norton 360. In general, though, I really feel Norton 360 should work extremely well on most systems.

Well recommended - but as always, back up your system before beginning, and have your network documentation handy so you know which specific ports you happen to be personally using, to keep those open.",With Proper Setup Runs like a Charm,1215820800,53,

PC Tools Internet Securty 2009 is a security suite with all the usual bells and whistles.  It defends your computer without hogging resources and without being too invasive.

Long Reivew:

For all you computer guys out there, let me first tell you where I am coming from.  I am running PC Tools on Windows Vista on the Bootcamp partition of my late 2007 iMac with 2 gb of memory.  I did not test the abilities of the program (as in trying to infect myself with spyware or viruses), I leave that to the expert.  I will try to convey the experience and hope that the experts.

SET UP:  At first, I tried to set this up by running Vista in virtualization using VMware's Fusion.  I couldn't get it to set up and run.  I tried and tried but it just wouldn't go.  So, I turned off the computer and booted into Bootcamp.  PC Tools installed quickly and automatically with the insertion of the CD.  There were minimal questions to ask.  One quibble:  when typing in the password there is a screen that has two buttons:  'Submit' and 'Continue.'  I kept hitting the continue button and was unable to register the product.  Once I realized that you had to hit 'submit' I was okay.  I still don't know why there is a 'continue' button...

FIRST RUN:  The program set itself up.  The initial splash screen was easy to negotiate.  Each component has its own set up panel and is self explanatory.  There are buttons for  anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-spam, and firewall settings.  Each menu is easy to negotiate and has a number of variable settings.  I didn't want to wait a long time for a full scan, so I opted for the more superficial, quick 'intelli-scan.'  The program did come up with a number of spyware issues that it quite easily deleted on command.

Of note, after installing it in Bootcamp, the suite worked flawlessly in virtualization.

RESOURCES:  Prior to running this suite, I was using Macafe's security suite.  In comparison, Macafe was a real resource hog, slowed down the machine, and asked too many questions.  What with Vista constantly asking for permissions, things were getting a little ridiculous.  The firewall seems to ask appropriate questions and allowed code to run after a single query.  Overall, I had a much better experience with this than Macafe and Trend before this.  Caveat emptor, I am no firewall maven so the efficacy of the firewall could be an issue here.  But assuming that the program performs well it works smoothly.  The experience here is a lot like running Commodo or Zone Alarm.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, it works smoothly and as advertised.  There is nothing new, innovative, or sensational about it but, after all, it is a security suite. For me, I felt that unlike my past experiences, this suite ran without slowing my computer down to a crawl.  It also was less invasive than other firewall options.  I also liked its simple, no-frills user interface.

PC tools makes Spyware Doctor which is an award winning spyware remover and is part of the suite.  If the antivirus, firewall, and anti-spam features are as efficacious, this would be a great addition to any PC.  And for the price, it's a bargain at that.",A Reasonable Security Suite for Windows,1230854400,,

I thought I'd upgrade to the 2014 version which came with the 220 page ""Legal Answer Book For Families"" giving me additional resources and quite a bit of information divided over 7 chapters.  I easily imported all of my information from my prior version and saved it. I didn't notice any changes.

Note: I'm not giving out any legal advice as I do not have any legal knowledge.

Oddly enough before I could even review this software, I had a family crisis which led to me learning a little bit more about wills and trusts and how important they are to a family.  I know how difficult it is to talk to loved ones about material things or money so it is best if people DO prepare everything as they would like it before his or her passing.

I always just thought you needed only a Will, and in that will you state what you want - to go to who you want - done.  In my case, I then learned about Probate.  And different types of Probate. And different Trusts. Trust Accounts.  Property and accounts that were forgotten to be put in the Trust.  And Legal Fees.  Sorry to ramble...

So my quick ""Will"" I did with Willmaker was all complete and specified everything as I wanted such as health care directives, pet care, Power-of-attorney, along with everything I decided in the event of my very, very, untimely passing.  It felt good to have things spelled out.

This brings me to the ""Trust Maker"" software which is included here as online software.  Personally I find ""Trust"" software valuable, but not totally liking the online/expiration part of it.  As a very longtime user of Quicken QuickBooks, I know the old upgrade deal$$. But on the other hand, I do realize if I went to an attorney and had a Will/Trust drawn up, then had to return for changes a year or three down the road, it isn't like they are going to do it for free. So, considering the price point, if I had to upgrade/renew later I am sure it would still be a better deal.  And yet, some people may opt for the knowledge of a qualified estate planner attorney at much more expense.

I recommend doing a little research on estate planning, wills and trusts.  I was forced to after the fact and learned much more than I thought I would.

As basic inexpensive estate planning software with The Legal Answer Book For Families, I'd recommend Willmaker 2014.

My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???

So, having returned my first copy of Quicken 2013 to the store from whence it came, and denied a refund despite its admitted failure to function correctly, then accepting a 50% discount on another software purchase as my consolation . . . I have now been forced to purchase a second copy of Quicken 2013 from  Amazon so as not to develop hand cramps from transcribing data from Quicken 2010 into Turbotax 2013 !

This kind of maltreatment of customers is why I shall curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and then light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I will also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) writes a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those Intuit developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they seem to have come.

The software itself is brilliant, if a bit on the heavy side. The preparation of a straightforward tax return is simple, fast, effective and as far as I have been able to discern, totally accurate. It would rate 5 stars if it weren't for the scam I perceive as outlined above.

Update 8 Jan 2013 - - - - -

If you have foreign accounts, beware! When transfers are made from Quicken 2013 (Q2013) of 2012 data entered in Q2010 and transferred into Q2013 because TurboTax 2012 (T2012) will not take data from Q2010 . . . Euros are not converted to Dollars when the transfer to Turbotax is made! My compensation is paid directly into an account in Europe denominated in Euros - but the transfer takes the total amount and calls it dollars. The interest on my bank account is kept as the same number, but shown as dollars, not Euros. Same for everything else I've checked so far. I don't think the IRS would be amused if I trusted Intuit's software. Neither should you.",CAUTION !!!  SCAM ALERT !!!,1356998400,26,

I think what I disliked is that there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of running around and learning. Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending). And really, the learning isn't all that bad.

I appreciate the characters more now, and the ending. I love the ending. Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.

However, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch.

As a photographer, I like to use photo editors for more than fixing the photo problemscropping, sharpening, adjusting hue, etc. If you primarily want to adjust your photosfixing them as photos including adding some color enhancements--there are several other very good, much less expensive programs like Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop Elements that do that.

This is a pretty expensive program and I wouldnt get it unless I felt it did something that I couldn't do less expensively elsewhere (or couldn't do at all elsewhere) or unless it made something much easier to do than a less expensive program did.

Painter 2016 doesnt make thing easierthe interface isn't horrible and the tutorials are goodbut it is not all that intuitive and takes a little patience. (I also found some of the Youtube videos helpful). If youve used Photoshop, etc. youll see a lot of the same concepts herethe layout of the workspace, the toolbox, palettes, brushes. You can use layers and adding one is just as easy as clicking New layer.
What I like is taking a photo and using it to make something that is less like a photo and more like a painting (obviously those who start from scratch can use the tools to create a drawing or painting from scratch. The dpi is good.) The cloning tool and tracing features are very useful. It will do underpainting for you automatically. You can choose the texture of your paper and between all the things youd expecta watercolor effect, pastel effect, charcoal, etc. Choosing the right brush is a big thing in Painter, but it isn't that hard to get used to.  In addition to the texture of your paper, you can control the brightness of it and  adjust the texture to customize it for your own needs. It was good for landscapes,  okay for portraits. There are some special effects filters, wood cut, kaleidoscope, glass distortion, and so onnot useful for me, but someone may like it.

If you want to make art, particularly from a photo, this is a good program for it. I found the graphic capabilities able to add the kind of artistic details that made the end product look more like something that had started out as a painting done from scratch rather than a digitally enhanced photo. If you understand what that means and want to do it with your photos (and have the time to do it--it's not like applying a filter, it's like actually making a work of art), you would probably enjoy this very much.

I decided to stop using it because it was simply more trouble than it was worth. It was basically nothing more than an obtrusive, bloated, system-slowing annoyance. And to be honest, I only gave Norton another shot and began using it again because I was able to acquire it for free.

Well, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this latest version because it is nothing like the last version of Norton internet security software I tried. It now has a nice list protections and features, and this version also comes with a money back guarantee.

Since installing this latest version I've noticed no increase in boot time, I've noticed no slowing of my system, and it basically just runs in the background with very little required interaction. Norton claims this version will actively protect you against viruses and other online security threats, and so far it's given me no reason to believe it's not doing that. And that's exactly what I want/expect from an internet security program. I want it to do its job, do it well, and leave me alone as much as possible.

I've had this latest version installed for about a month now, and so far I'm pretty impressed and quite happy with it. Do give this latest version a try. I'm fairly certain you'll be happy with it too.

My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.

All the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.

Even using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.

I had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.

The long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.

Also when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.

We were so happy to uninstall this from all of our computers. Now are computers are back to normal.

We did spend quite a lot of time installing this program and then uninstalling it. What a waste of time this was. I can't believe how poor this program is, I'm really surprised.

I'm going to try be as unbiased as possible when doing this review, so I will try to curb my praises for the meritorious Bit Defender program. Yes, I admit I have used this program in the past, so please don't hold it against me because I loved it then, and sorry, I still do. Now for the past 3 years, though, I have been using McAfee, so that is what I can compare it to, and have not used any other program.

Contrary to other peoples' posts on here about the product being a pain to install, I encountered no such thing. You place the CD in the tray, and it uses a website like installation progression. You are shown 10 steps that you have to go through in order to complete registration, you click next after each one and that is that. I had to install one update and restart only once. After that, it is ready to use. No more than 10 minutes I promise.

This software boasts the highest detection rate of all security programs with a 98% detection rate and updates hourly. Whether that's an annoyance or assurance, that is for you to decide. I felt the Bit Defender program take about the same amount of ""taxing"" on internet browsing as McAfee, for the fact it scans everything you look at, which is a part of an option you can turn off, to further elevate your assurance of their protection credentials. The plus side is that, it does not tax my SYSTEM physical performance at all, compared to the very sluggish program offered by McAfee.

The overall interface of the program is very sleek, very easy to read and all encompassing. You have 2 options with the interface, you can either show the Beginner or Advanced interface, which are both exceptional. The beginner has un-implicit titles to search through and the advanced is the polar opposite, both meeting needs for everyone. My history with this program and using the new one meet the same end. This program is the best anti everything. I have never gotten a virus/spyware in my computer when this program in use, something that McAfee can't say. And I don't want to wait years for this program to allow me to obtain one, so I'm going with what I know.

Now here are your quick positives:
1. 98% detection rate of virus/spyware according to av-test.org, the best out of all programs including, McAfee with 86%, Norton with 96% and Trend Micro with 95%
2. Doesn't use a lot of system resources. From my experiences, it slows down internet browsing much as the same as McAfee, BUT it is an option you can turn down or turn off. McAfee, also, really bogs down my systems physical performance, where Bit Defender does not.
3. Easy to manage options and interface, being able to switch between the novice and advanced views.
4. Anti-Phising, Anti-Root kit, Gamer Mode, Laptop Mode (power conservation), Excellent Firewall.
5. I almost forgot the omniscient scan itself! I have a 300gb Harddrive with 180GB of space used for data, the scan took under an Hour! I could also use other programs pretty comfortably while the scan was being conducted too. Not to mention my computer is 6 years old! McAfee took well over 3 hours.
6. Parental Controls, limiting a person on the internet, from material to time limits
7. Networking and accessing shared computers. With other computers around your network that has the same Bit Defender on it, you can set up access to the computers with the Users permission. This is handy for Corporate/Business offices

You know, as of now there are no negatives, I never had any negatives with this product. And it seems like I never will at this rate.

You see, I have both Mac's and PC's in my home, and at various times may use either depending upon my mood and/or whether it seems that I've not used one system enough lately (so that it's batteries get charged/discharged enough to keep them useful, etc.)

With that said, I do admit that my primary realm is that of Windows PC's, and not so much the Mac.  I have a lovely little Macbook that I keep up-to-date with patches and system upgrades, and again, on more than the odd occasion I pull out the Macbook and enjoy using it to surf through my regular stomping grounds.  Doing so lets me stay familiar with the Mac and gives me a chance to see some sites with slightly different results (when, for example, a site renders better in one browser than another).

In any case, I saw an opportunity to check out the Smart Surfing for Mac software by Trend Micro and opted to see what the experience of installing 'security software' on the Mac is like compared to doing the same thing on a PC.

On a PC, again, as hinted at in some of the commercials we've been bombarded with (this time from the Apple side), surfing the web without protection of some sort is a very dangerous proposition.  There are too many vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of if the computer user (PC user) hasn't kept their system updated and patched.  Regardless, those words shouldn't be taken to mean that in reality Mac's or *nix based systems are less vulnerable to malware as all systems have vulnerabilities, but because so many computer systems in use in the world are 'PC's' the PC world presents a bigger target and offers people like me much more opportunity to be familiar with internet security software.

Mac's have their share of vulnerabilities including vulnerabilities due to third party software (Adobe, Sun JAVA, etc.) and even the underlying software.  Because of that, it's still a very good idea to have internet security software installed on your system, no matter what software you prefer.  Which brings us back to the purpose of this particular review, the Trend Smart Surfing for Mac software, and whether or not it should be your software of choice in this area.

Now, I must admit, I don't have the familiarity with the choices of software packages that are available on a Mac.  On a PC I could probably name a half dozen internet security/anti-malware packages without even thinking about it.  With a few minutes thought I could probably add another half dozen, and with a few minutes to search the web I'd probably find another dozen that I just couldn't remember when I was under pressure.  On a Mac the list of software that I'm aware of is much, much smaller, to the point of being nearly non-existent.  I count that as my own fault, and beg your indulgence, as the list of programs I've actually used for this purpose (on a Mac at least) is in the neighborhood of 2 (which I won't bother naming here).  One was open source software and another was a commercial program provided by my employer for employees to use on their systems.

The open source software was a very simple program to install and was equally easy to remove/uninstall.  The commercial software was a bit more difficult to figure out how to uninstall and that threw me for a bit of loop, compliments of the installer for the Trend Smart Surfing for the Mac product.  The installer for the Trend Smart Surfing product will insist that any existing security software be uninstalled, but, in a more than irritating flaw (in my book) the installer doesn't tell you what product it has found that needs to be removed.  It would be very, very helpful to open an install log that notes the software that was found as doing so would help the user find out what they need to do if they wish to remove the old product and proceed with this one.  Eventually I got past the issue once I found the uninstall command script that I needed to run to remove the originally installed product.

I'd swear that in the past installs and uninstalls of software on the Mac were basically a case of dragging and dropping the installed software onto the system or into the recycle bin, but that wasn't at all the case with my old security software.  Ugh.  While this isn't really the fault of the Trend Smart Surfing product, I note that the Trend product's install disc showed a menu choice for 'Uninstall' in it's menu and that leaves me thinking that apparently I'm going to have to keep the CD/DVD handy well into the future just so I can put it back into the system and use that option when I'm ready to remove the product (if that ever happens).  I'm guessing there's probably some uninstall scripts that can be downloaded and used if needed, but I hope not to ever need to find that out, or at least hope not to find it out when I'm in a very frustrated state :-/

Once I removed the existing software the installer proceeded normally and the software installed itself just fine, up to the point that it was supposed to be registered.  At that point, Firefox (my default browser at the time) opened and refused to open the destination web site because, uh, the site certificate for the destination site was invalid.  What?!!?  Oops!  I guess Trend Micro forgot to update the certificate for that site, but that doesn't necessarily inspire confidence in the vendor, no?

Beyond those issues I'd have to complain a little about the packaging.  The contents of the package are a small quick reference card (approx. 6 pages if you count it's cover), folded in thirds.  The folded page size is a bit bigger than that of a CD/DVD, but in reality it seems that the quick reference card could easily be resized into one that would fit easily into a more environmentally friendly CD/DVD sized case.  In addition to the quick reference card there's the disc that comes in a paper envelope with a label on the back that provides you with the required serial number.  Ok, not so bad in that area, but again, be sure to keep that number/case and disc handy well into the future.  That's it.  That's what in the box, which inspires the question of why is there a box?  A box with a bunch of empty space in it.  Totally unnecessary packaging which seems silly and wasteful.  I would note that the box features a 'Printed on Recycled Paper' logo which is encouraging, but it still seems unnecessary as a CD sized package (like an Audio CD) would easily do the job.

On the software product itself, it seems adequate and seems to be working, but in reality, as a fairly careful web surfer (I know, we all make typo's every now and then and wind up going to sites we didn't intend, and/or we get sent to sites that aren't what we expected after we've executed a web search) I don't tend to be going to sites that would set off alarms and opening dialog boxes questioning whether or not I wish to continue (and potentially damage my own system).  I want internet security software that works, but is not intrusive.  If the software gets in my way, it'll get turned off and become totally useless.

The big question is whether or not the software is worth the purchase price?  Despite the impression that some people have of Mac owners, I don't personally know Mac users that happily toss their money away on either hardware or software.  Just because Mac owners pay more for a quality computing product, that doesn't mean they want to keep doing that when it comes to additional software that they'll install on their systems.  Any way, in the case of the Trend Smart Surfing for Mac the product seems to deliver value at a reasonable level.  Not an overwhelming value, but a reasonable value for the product's sale price.

If you don't go with this product, please do understand that I heartily encourage any computer user that will ever connect their system to the internet or any other computer system to run anti-malware software on their systems.

The bad news: Although the software initially seemed to work fairly transparently, after a system reboot it kept me from being able to access the Internet using either Safari or Firefox. And this on the least intrusive settings.

The in-between news: It was easy to use Smart Surfing to check for malicious code on my previously unprotected (for years) Mac, and I was glad that it found nothing bad lurking on my drives. On the other hand, that also suggests that whatever I've BEEN doing (ie, surfing with reasonable caution) combined with the natural safety of the Mac OS, is all the protection I needed. If Smart Surfing was less expensive (and didn't bring my browsers to a halt), I might like having it as a safety net. But at this price, it just didn't measure up.

In fairness, I'll say that some of the protective features are probably useful for people who are inexperienced on the web, or who share their computers with inexperienced people.

While very helpful in deciding which numbers go where -- and this becomes easier and more automatic each year -- the biggest help for me is that there are no longer math errors in my forms.  I had to recheck each form at least twice when still doing the taxes on paper.  This is a big time saver.
You still have to keep good records, save receipts for reporting sales taxes from online purchases (yes, you do, even though many folks don't), keep donation receipts and a computer file (TurboTax does this for you) or paper file of previous tax years.  If you get audited, you will need the paper trail.
TurboTax offers a number of extra-cost services along the way as you work through the program;  it's up to the user to decide if they are worth the extra money.
Many state now offer free on-line state tax filing.  E-filing state taxes online costs extra from TurboTax.  Generally, you just have to enter numbers manually on a free state web site.

I have a variety of programs, ranging from free stuff (Gimp) to higher end programs (Photoshop).  I am not a professional photographer, and I certainly don't pretend to be an expert at photo editing.  That said, I have been using Adobe Photoshop for some years (up to CS3), and I am familiar with what it can, and cannot do.  So when I saw this software and its price point, I figured it would be a good addition to my existing photo editing software library.

In the past couple of months, I find myself using PhotoPlus more than Photoshop.  For starters, it opens much quicker than Photoshop, so I find myself using it more to handle quick ""everyday"" editing jobs.  For the more difficult photo editing projects, I still tend to lean more toward Photoshop, but that is probably because I am more familiar with that tool.

One thing I do find very useful is the PanoramaPlus X4 photo-stitching software that comes with PhotoPlus. Canon's photo stitching software was very basic and cumbersome, but this is much improved.  Another feature of PhotoPlus I like is the ability to quickly post images to Facebook.  I also like PhotoPlus's built in support for geotagged images.

On the downside, I still turn to Photoshop for white balance support.  As with some other reviewers, I also had some issues with the scroll wheel zoom feature not zooming where I intended.

However I was recently injured in a fall, and my left wrist is in a splint and I simply cannot type. This forced me, as a professional attorney with lots of writing to do, to investigate this Dragon voice recognition software. I have now been using it for about a week, and I can truly say that my life will never be the same.

This software works amazingly well. Firstly, let me say that I had no difficulty at all installing the software. I installed it on both my work and home computers and both times it installed effortlessly with no issues. Some of the other reviews stated that Dragon is difficult to install. I did not find this to be the case.

In terms of performance, I find Dragon to be little short of amazing. There is a bit of a learning curve. Firstly, Dragon likes it if you speak the entire sentence at one time. It clearly derives which spelling of the word to use by the context of your sentence and if you break your sentence up into phrases you will get a somewhat higher error rate than if you speak the entire sentence at a time. I have now trained myself to do this and the performance of Dragon when used in this fashion is pretty spectacular.

I am now exploring Dragon's learn function and it appears to work very well. In the legal business we use a number of somewhat odd words which at first Dragon had problems with. However using Dragon's learn features I have managed to add many of these words to Dragon's vocabulary with the result that Dragon handles these odd legal terms very well.

I will update this review after I've been using Dragon for a longer period of time. However, right now, I can truly report that Dragon has saved the day terms of my productivity at work. I simply cannot get by without being able to type things myself. The days in business when executives and lawyers had a secretary to take dictation are long gone for most of us. It is simply too expensive. Dragon handles this function beautifully and I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the program. At the price that it costs here on Amazon Dragon is a howling bargain and I am delighted that I have discovered it. Highly recommended without reservation. RJB.",A fantastic product.,1501027200,5,

Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...

WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!

Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)?
I don't think so!

Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet. But that is why there are so many specialized Software available!  And, what is even worse, WinVISTA will not let exactly these Software titles function as intended!

But that's ok too, there's a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.

My one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.

But really, they're minor complaints. This game is rich in history, both fictional and some real, the spooky air is well maintained, and the mystery goes perfectly with the adventure.

You may not realize, but the 2011 version was $69 (essentially the same product) and previous versions charged upwards of $100. I hope this indicates a commitment on the part of Family Tree Maker to keep the product affordable in the future.

That said, we've used 3 different versions of Family Tree Maker, and ""tinkered"" with the Ancestry.com online tree maker. This, of course, has been the top selling & #1 rated genealogy software for many years.

We are NOT accomplished genealogists or computer experts ... however, if you're fairly new to this process & are shopping around for genealogy software, here are some observations we suspect may be helpful:

-The upgrade from 2010 to 2011 was substantial, but there is almost no difference between 2011 and 2012. No need to upgrade if you have 2011.

-Both the 2011 and the 2012 versions are significantly more complex than older versions (the previous version we used was 2005 or 2006).

-Our goal for this software was to aid my grandfather through the family tree research process. I'm a novice at family research, he's a novice at computers. Unfortunately these newer versions are too complex for him, not as intuitive as the online tree maker or the older versions. He won't be using the 2012 version, which basically means we're dead in the water for the time being.

-If using Windows XP, the 2012 version requires SP3 (service pack 3). They don't advertise this, but if you read the small print on their web site, any other version of Windows XP is not supported.

-If you have an existing family tree on Ancestry.com, merge your software data AT YOUR OWN RISK! As I understand it, the information on your existing account may get overwritten by the information on your software (meaning, blanks will replace actual data). Backups on Ancestry.com do NOT back up all your data, either. I know this sounds convoluted, but I suggest creating a new Ancestry.com account, or simply not merging accounts (cut & paste information, etc).

-If you've never undertaken a family genealogy before, you might consider starting out on Ancestry.com before buying any software. Granted, this software is not a huge investment, but anyone can get a 2-week or 30-day free trial on Ancestry (you don't need the software) and the free online tree-builder feature that is simple & straightforward.

-You really need access to your own records, or online research, or a membership with Ancestry.com (free trial included) if you're going to actually fill out your family tree. This software by itself will not do it for you.

-If you want help building your family tree or doing research, keep in mind the LDS (Mormon) church offers free help to the public. If you just want to chart out your tree on old-fashioned graph paper, for example, you can accomplish this free via email, phone, or visiting a Mormon genealogy center. If you buy the software, the tech support is very good, too.

They will *not* try to convert you - these offices are very PR-friendly (though they may give your deceased family members one of their controversial posthumous baptism ceremonies!). A central tenant of this denomination is knowing your family tree, so devotees can track down ancestors after the 2nd coming. They are therefore happy to help non-members in creating family genealogies. The church is closely tied to both the Family Tree Maker software, and also to Ancestry.com.

BOTTOM LINE:

If you're a beginner and not sure where to start, skip the software for now and get a free trial at Ancestry.com. The free tree builder is a great place to start, or just dig around the Ancestry database and collate your own research.

If you're committed to this process, are ready to dig in, & don't have any trepidations about navigating new software, then the 2012 Deluxe version is it! It has the most features and is actually cheaper than previous versions.

Hope this helps - good luck!",Comparison of 3 versions of Family Tree Maker (3.5 stars for the 2012 version),1331769600,7,

I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case.

I had the opportunity to grab a copy of Norton 360 and I am very glad I did. Norton 360 is exactly what an anti-virus software needs to be and offers protection in all areas of your computer. Last year I got a Toshiba Satellite that included Windows Vista (which is a pain already) and a trial version of MacAfee, I never understood how to optimize the use of the MacAfee application, it had too many windows and you had to upgrade different things at different times, I was relieved when the trial expired and I got to install a free application called AVG. AVG was good enough for what I needed but suffered from the same thing, 'if you want anti-spy ware you have to download and install this', 'if you want security using the internet install this other thing'...

I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton 360, first of all the installation was quick, it ran for over an hour (as I decided to have it scan my laptop while installing, if you decide not to it may take less time) Once I completed the setup and the application opened I went through the menus in one single screen which is great! The four areas in which the application is divided are in a single screen with submenus when you click over any of them, from this main menu you can scan, setup and even defragment your hard drive (the PC Tune-up feature helps optimize computer performance).  The time it has been installed in my laptop I have not noticed any slowness in performance and it has worked smoothly in the background while I surf the web or work in it.

One feature I liked is the 'Identity protection', in which you setup a profile with your personal info (including credit card number) and it will keep you safe when doing transactions online, you setup a password that Norton360 will require when doing transactions regardless of any security measures the web pages you use have. In my case I access my bank online to do transactions all the time and purchase from web sites, this feature serves as an additional security option. Norton360 also allows me to monitor my network and it even has functionalities that the software that came with my wireless router doesn't have!

Why?

#1 It's easy to use out of the box--- many of the controls are easy enough to figure out just by using them, it installs easy on both Mac and PC systems (I installed the program on both an old eMac and a low end Vista laptop successfully).

#2 It's really powerful--- once you really get into the software, it's amazing all the different brushes and textures and effects that you can do to make really impressive art.

#3 The tutorials are first rate--- A thick instruction manual that actually is well written, and actually teaches you about basic principles of art and painting.  There are also a whole series of video tutorials included free.  You can tell that a lot of hard work and frankly a lot of love went into this, which is a rarity for computer software these days.

#4 It's a great value--- For all you get, the price is very reasonable.  And check the company's website, if you're still not sold they were at the time of this writing offering a 60 day free downloadable trial.

It was a nice clean Win 7 machine and (rant on) I was pleased to not have to put up with one drive, the microsoft store, or all those ""features"" that assume I want my work machines to play music and games, download ""highly rated"" apps, and all that other sperg that gets in the way of actually trying to accomplish something meaningful (rant off). That said, the only unwanted install from office 2016 appears to be one drive. This will not be a factor for people installing onto Windows 10 machines because those come pre-infected.

First a confession - I've been transitioning my WIndows machines to LibreOffice because LibreOffice appears more secure. It doesn't phone home to provide ""usage statistics,"" and most importantly it doesn't run macros such as those exploited by that ransomeware that encrypts all your files. The further you are from those macros and from any autoplay functions, the safer you are.

But... I got a chance at a review copy of Office 2016 and decided to test out a few things. The install was easy. I had to enter the product code twice though - once before creating a new MS account and once after. Odd, but it only wasted a minute. Now, those tests...

First - can it be run without ever signing into a ""Microsoft account""? I don't want to log onto Microsoft's servers or risk unintentional uploads when I'm working on confidential documents, for example, documents subject to an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). No, you do need to create (or have) a ""microsoft account"" to install the software. This isn't particularly egregious because most commercial software requires such an account. It's just part of the registration process these days. Also, the account name is an email address and that address can be -any- email address. It doesn't have to be a hotmail account or anything like that but it does have to be valid because the registration process includes you verifying the address.

Second - can I run office 2016 without being logged onto a microsoft account? Yes. I edited files after restarting the computer and without signing into that MS account. I ran these tests on a Win7 machine but believe I can do the same with a windows 10 machine having a properly installed local account.

Third - can I run office 2016 offline? Yes. I disconnected the machine from the internet and restarted it. There were no issues creating and editing documents.

I did not test moving the license from one machine to another. I've done that with office 2013 and believe that it won't be that much of a hassle.

As for office 2016 itself. It's office - a package I've used in various forms for over twenty years. It does most everything I need and the menus and stuff are pretty much where they are in office 2013. That's what is most important to me - my productivity after installing new software. To be honest, for my usage this version is the same as office 2013 because I'm running 2013 on a windows 10 machine on which I suffer OneDrive and a plethora of other annoyances as well.

Now - what is up with my OneDrive disgust? It's that I need many gigs of -secure- storage. For cloud storage, there are HIPAA compliant providers who don't weasel strange crapware onto my computer. Some of those providers piggyback off of Amazon's wondrous cloud (AWS - amazon web services is a wonder to behold). I really want the ability to uninstall OneDrive (and many other odious bits) from my work machines just for security from malware exploiting stuff I never wanted anyway.","Five stars for windows 10 machines, three for the rest",1464566400,3,

This forced surprise upgrade fees when people were doing their taxes because of the removed forms (which where included in previous years). Fortunately Intuit ultimately relented thanks to the consumer outcry. Not only that, I'm not happy with Intuit's Congressional lobbying efforts to prevent simplification of filing your taxes (guess why?).

Unfortunately so far my experience with H&R Block has been disappointing so far but hopefully that will change. If not then I'll be back to TurboTax next year.

1. Upon installing the product, it recommended that I create an account at hrblock.com. Upon doing this, I quickly discovered that they prevent pasting into the password fields. I greatly despise this because it's terribly annoying and it encourages insecure (weaker) passwords because you can't paste more complex ones in (it can also cause problems for password managers). I discovered a great Chrome extension in the process though, called ""Don't f*** with paste"", but this wasted my time and made me question H&R Block's poor security choices. I want REAL security, not the illusion of it from not being able to paste my complex password into the password field. If they do this then what other poor security choices could they be making? Good security choices need to be at the forefront when dealing with people's financial information and social security numbers and this does not reflect well on that.

2. ONLY ONE DAY after I bought it (the Amazon download), the price was lowered. No problem I thought, I bought it yesterday and Amazon will refund me the difference because Amazon will do the right thing. THEY DIDN'T REFUND ME and gave me some strange excuse about their ""effort to provide the most competitive prices on our digital software and video games"". In their ""effort to provide the most competitive prices"" they couldn't give me a competitive price because I bought it one day earlier? Really? It doesn't really seem like they're serious about that ""effort"". Anyway, the end result is that I'm disappointed in both H&R Block and Amazon. Usually Amazon impresses but not this time... so beware about this issue and don't expect any refunds should the price drop from when you bought it, even if you bought it just 1 day before.... or at least buy it somewhere else where they give you price protection instead of excuses (if you care about this). UPDATE: In their email response declining a price match I answered 'No' to their 'Did I solve your problem' question and they said 'Please give us another chance to help you.' so I emailed them and gave them another chance. This time they gave me some promo credit for 'Amazon Digital Software and Video Games Download'. I would have preferred a refund or credit good toward any purchase but at least it's something. I'm still disappointed due to the hassle and that the credit is pretty worthless because I buy so little digital software and video games from Amazon, and this experience just makes me want to never buy downloaded software items again from Amazon.

Now that that's out of the way, I can say that I did not (yet) run into any issues downloading the product and installing it on Windows 10. Coming from TurboTax the interface doesn't look as polished but I am more concerned about function than looks. Importing from my 2014 TurboTax file seems to have worked well. No errors or bugs found (so far anyway).

I plan to update my review as warranted.

It's a good idea, but it seems like a repackaging of the retail product rather than the truly business oriented Endpoint Security.

When I received the package it was a box much like pictured. It contained a plastic coated cardboard business card sized instruction card with the product key and a url: norton.com/subscribe. There was also a small one piece of glossy paper get started document that seemed more marketing than actual help. There was no CD - this is a download only product in a box of almost only empty space. That may not be a bad thing as with a high speed connection I downloaded and installed it on a windows 7 PC in about 10 minutes.

When installed Norton Small Business it's pretty much Norton internet security. There is some central license control. Not all that much to describe beyond that. It has the usual browser plugins and malware protection as well as Outlook virus scanning and spam filtering.

With additional devices one can login to the Norton account and download the product directly on the device or send an email invitation and have it installed from a link in the email. That's on PC's.

I have a iPhone so I thought way-cool - now I have some malware protection available. But wait - there's less. When I emailed an invitation to my account and opened it on my iPhone and clicked the link it directed me to the iTunes app store and the Norton small business app. The app description showed screens with a locator and showing backups of contacts and other information. When I got it installed and activated (required my Norton account login) I ended up with a big friendly Norton icon on my iPhone.

When I opened the Norton Small Business app on my iPhone all I got was a locator app. I was disappointed there was no real protection and it consumed one of the 10 seats for almost nothing in functionality! The locator can be activated from the Norton small business control panel. With this I was able to:

1) locate my iPhone (it put it about a mile away from where I was sitting!?!?!)
2) call my phone (like I couldn't do that without the app?)
3) i could ""scream"" my phone. I could cause the iPhone speakers to sound an alarm sound, not an actual scream. If it was an actual recorded scream, that might be kind of cool or fun. Maybe it would be good for locating it but it did not seem to work with the iPhone on silent. Lame again.

So, the locator could not locate my phone within a mile, it provided ways of doing things that I could do by calling the phone (get someone to answer and make a noise to find it between the sofa cushions. And it takes a whole seat from the 10 available. Unless you just have too many, don't bother.

So with PC's it's a more or less centrally deployed and managed Norton Internet Security. On iPhone it's a waste of time. I don't have a Mac to install this on so can't really comment on what it is for Mac's.

One item of the hype is the no virus guarantee. As has been pointed out it's limited to Mac's and PC's and for Norton tech to try to remove the virus. If they decide they can, you can get a refund of the purchase price which may be prorated based on where you may be in your subscription. Not much of a guarantee, more marketing hype.

Because of mobile and zero virus guarantee being more hype than real, and the PC version seems just a repackaging of the Internet Security retail product.

On TV, Rosetta Stone promises users of its products that they will be comfortable with any of their language courses in short order, citing their use by the US State Department, the US Army and others.

Well, time to give it a try. The yellow box's contents were a User's Guide, the usual assortment of user agreements, registration cards, a Quick Start guide, a small pamphlet on setting up the included USB headset on one's computer and of course, the software DVDs (one application disk and three language disks, one each for French levels 1, 2, and 3) along with Audio Companion CDs that serve as a complement to the software course--supposedly, these will help you practice what you've learned in the software and is meant to be played on a CD player or downloaded (as they put it) to an MP3 player.

In itself, impressive set if a little overwhelming, but I found the instructions rather straightforward and easy-to-use. Just following the instructions in the Quick Start guide was enough to have me operational on my within the hour. The headset installation instructions were equally as easy to follow on my Vista PC and there's even a French QWERTY keyboard overlay. The folks at Rosetta Stone have outdone themselves in this regard. There are far too many instances of software installation and use that get in the way of the software itself.

So, how did I find the software and did I learn some French? I admit freely that I was a bit skeptical about the company's claims.

Their admonition is to simply trust the method as it works without requiring translation. They promise that I will be speaking French immediately from the first lesson and that was no joke.

The levels are broken into units which are further subdivided into core lessons, focused activities and finally, a milestone. The program starts with a few questions about the user's goals which can revolve around both speaking and writing the language, just writing or just speaking. The recommended default is to focus on both speaking and writing, which is what I chose.

From the ""home"" screen, the user can see their progress along the lesson, the unit and the entire course. It's truly easy to use. The content is also incredible: you will either type responses, listening to and repeating after a speaker (which is scored as well) or choosing the correct answers from multiple-choices or typing out the proper sentence. In so doing, you find yourself picking up on vocabulary, proper pronunciation, writing and grammatical structure.

I have finished the first level and I'm looking forward to the second level as it is easy, but hard work if that makes sense. I haven't yet listened to the audio CDs, but if the software is anything to go by, my god. I am so impressed with the quality of the software and instruction that I am giving Rosetta Stone French the highest recommendations.

After doing a clean install, I didn't have any problems with Vista recognizing my hardware except for my Epson photo printer which I expected since it wasn't compatitable in the Beta version.

I ran into a couple of software compatitabilty issues.

Since I have 2 hard drives, I kept XP on the other drive in case I have to play old games.

I knew that Vista wasn't that much better than XP function wise but it did offer a different look with the Aero feature which meant I had to upgrade to higher end video card but it was worth it.

I was very disappointed when I discovered that the defrag program didn't provide choice in what drive to defrag(I have 8 partitions) or any kind of status bar to view to actually see if the program is running.

Get a third party defrag program.

Setting up my network was a little tricky since the default workgroup name was changed to Workgroup from MSHOME in XP and I wasn't aware of that.

I couldn't setup a new printer on my network XP laptop since it couldn't use the printer driver from my Vista computer. After going to the Vista Community forum, I discovered how to setup a new printer port on both computers.

The Sidebar is a nice feature. The control panel is more in depth

Overall I'm disappointed that there wasn't a major change in Vista after 5 years of XP but it does have a lot of bells and whistles.

People are saying that the $159.00 price tag is overpriced but you get a lot more than the Basic such as the Media Center program and Aero feature.

If you don't need the extras then buy the Basic. At least you have a choice in features.

But I do recommend keeping XP on a separate drive as a backup OS",Just bells and whistles with Vista,1173312000,4,
6558,3,False,"11 12, 2013",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B008H3SW4I,,Trenton Bennett,"UPDATE:  Windows 8 users can now upgrade to Windows 8.1.  The free upgrade is not as obvious as using Windows Update:  instead it is posted in the Microsoft Store and you'll need to launch the Store to get to it.  From there, Microsoft has added what they call ""Update for Windows 8.1"", and the tweaks in this update (to the update) are remarkable improvements to the OS in subtle ways.  It's also important to note that a Windows 8.1 user will lose support for their product if it is not patched with ""Update for Windows 8.1"" a lot sooner than users of 8 or of 8.1 with the update.

BEFORE YOU UPGRADE: stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments). This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade. It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches. For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet! I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.

Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag.  The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, ""Your Start Menu is now full-screen"":  we have a ""Modern UI"" (formerly called ""Metro"") that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine.  When you want to find a specific program or setting, you just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes.  Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet: you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.

This is really the heart of Windows 8's problems:  its identity crisis.  It can be jarring to flip back and forth between Modern and Desktop views, but Microsoft can't let completely go of everything that came before without driving people even crazier, so there will be times you're trying to do a thing--like manage users or configure a network connection--and you might be in Modern's full-screen left-to-right only to find yourself dumped into the desktop and shown a dialog box you may remember from earlier versions...and then you need to head back to Modern to take another step.  If you're doing everyday computing, like reading documents or checking mail, you don't run across this too often, but the moment you need to take step outside of the ordinary, good luck figuring out which path you should start from, or which you'll end up on.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy. Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7. Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8. Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop). Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything.  Sometimes you can use the wheel to scroll and sometimes you can't. My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.

For some features, time will tell. I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score). The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel: expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen. If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS: so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.

Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.

UPDATE, 11/2013: Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better. If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost. The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8. Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences. I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason. Perhaps with time it will get better.",A Forward Step Held Back by its Past,1384214400,9,

As a user of Paint Shop Pro since version 4.14 in the 1990s, I have long endorsed PSP as a great, alternative program to Photoshop for graphic artists on a budget. As of this version, I can no longer endorse this product.

Words cannot express how much I hate Paint Shop Pro X4. As I stare into the screen with multiple confusing tabs and screen-hogging image indexes, please know that only one thing remains certain: that I hate PSPX4 with every tired muscle in my graphic artist body. Until X3, the changes they made were minimal, and contributed to more and advanced features.

However, Corel has now ruined it by trying to simplify it for amateur photographers when they should be developing it for professional artists. It's impossible to tell if this is meant for photographers, graphic artists, scrapbookers or for coloring books. It's like all these multi-function ""smart"" devices-- they do a lot of things, but they don't do anything really well, and you have to become an expert on the device to get anything out of it. PSPX4 tries to be all things to all people and fails miserably.

Corel is also trying to pull one over by claiming to have new features that have been available in the program for years. Moving a feature around and calling attention to it does not make it new--it makes the company irritating, as well as making the program difficult to for long time users to find, and difficult for new users to learn in the first place. What was once a contender to compete against the mighty Photoshop is now a glorified app for removing red eye and endless tabs and indexes. X4 is finally showing the strain of executive meddling and has jumped the shark. I have spent more hours than I care to count trying to make X4 functional and have only emerged frustrated beyond all reason.

I would advise others to stick with X3 as well as earlier versions. If you must try this program, download the demo before making a financial commitment. Better yet, I would recommend users invest their time, money and effort in Photoshop, since Corel shows no interest in making a better graphics program and only wants to make a buck from an uninformed amateur photography base.

I will not stop using Photoshop until Corel comes to its senses and stops trying to overtake the plumbing. As it is, with PSPX4 it's too easy to stop up the drain. I have never given any version of PSP a bad review, which makes me hate PSPX4 that much more. PSPX4 is ultimately penny wise and pound foolish, but mostly I won't use it because I hate it so very, very much.

Since I am also new to the product, I was also curious about the interface, in that I didn't have any expectations based on previous versions, unlike others that have posted here.

Suffice it to say that any hopes I had were destroyed almost instantly.  This is one of the worst user interfaces I've seen in quite a while, certainly in a major product from a major publisher (and I'm a software development exec).  Virtually everything is non-standard and few things work as expected: clicks and double clicks, right/left button functionality, drag & drop, highlighting & selecting, map navigation, context menus, zooming, export & import, etc.  The iconography is just awful, awful - reminiscent of the software of a decade or more ago.  I also found the functionality outside of routing and route planning (both of which are excellent) to be more restrictive than hoped, with particular disappointment in the territory functionality, territory definitions being too limited for my uses.  Finally, the map graphics themselves just don't make the grade.  While readable, they don't display any real quality until quite closely zoomed, looking quite sketchy to that point.

The high point of the software is the routing functionality, as mentioned above.  It is powerful, flexible, and has many options I have not seen elsewhere, and which are far beyond anything available in Google Maps, Mapquest, or other web-based mapping software.

In a pure head to head feel between Video Studio Pro X6, here are my impressions:
 - PowerDirector has faster rendering
 - Power Director has more features
 - Power Director multiple track editing seems more powerful
 - Power director is little more difficult to use

I was able to create a very nice video of my daughter's dance recital with multiple overlays, transitions, and audio tracks very quickly.  The crossfade transition works really nicely and very naturally.  It also gives me a wide range of rendering options (I tried about 8 of them) and was happy with the results.  I do wish the rendering options provided better contextual help to guide me in choosing the best one.

While editing, the preview is very crisp and smooth with no jitter or artifacting.  For reference, I was using a i7-4770 as of this writing. I didn't find the storyboard view very useful.

I tried out a number of the fixes that it can apply at rendering time. They do add time to the rendering, but I was generally pleased with the results. The lighting and color adjustments worked very nicely.  The image stabilization option works fairly well, but somehow I felt that it also lost enough sharpness that I ended up removing the fix and re-rendering.  The basic thing it seems to do is zoom in the picture a little (cutting off a little bit on each edge) and then hiding the recorded movement by moving the hidden frame around.  It definitely stabilized, but you do lose a little fidelity due to at least in part the digital zoom applied.

On the ease of use front (why I knock it a star), I did get a little frustrated with adjusting the audio and keeping it synced up properly. I kept finding that as I inserted tracks that the audio would get off sync and I'd have to fiddle with it to get it back synced up.","Very powerful, definitely fast, but a little non-intuitive to use at times - from an Amateur / Enthusiast viewpoint",1388620800,,

There are added benefits by purchasing Office 365 Home Premium;however, you are renting so if you decided not to renew you no longer own the rights to having Office 2013.  I had already purchased Office 365 Home Premium prior to the copy I received in the prime program.

The benefit of the subscription is you are allowed to have Office 2013 installed on 5 computers.  It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers.  There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software.  You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed.  It is also important to note that you will need Windows 7 or 8 to install Office 2013.

If you are already using Office 2010 I do not see any major improvement to move to Office 365. Office 2013 is very similar to Office 2010 but integrated with the cloud.

Here some of the biggest issues I have with Office 365 Home Premium.  I reached out to Microsoft support to verify my findings. I kept the complete chat log.

All these so called benefits / add-ons are only good for the person who signed up for Office 365 Home Premium.

20GB Skydrive, Skype Account, Office on Demand only apply one account.  There is no option to create a sub-account for household members. Your only option would be to share your account and password information. While I have no issue providing my spouse my information but I will not provide my credentials to my account.  You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value. Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS.

I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install.

I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes.  I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium.  If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars.  If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product.

If you work at a company that has an active Microsoft Enterprise Agreement you should check with the EA Administrator because you may have access to the Home Use Program which allows you to purchase Office 2013 for $10

The application is easy to install, it's easy to adjust the settings to fit your needs, it automatically updates regularly, and it identifies threats that some other applications miss.

I've been running two other security and anti-virus applications on my computer over the last year and neither of those programs identified a Trojan Horse that had been installed on my computer. After I installed Trend Micro Internet Security, it immediately identified the Trojan Horse and quarantined the file to protect my computer. I did a Google search to find out more about the quarantined file (to make sure it was a Trojan Horse and not a safe file that was misidentified) and sure enough it is a known malware/Trojan Horse file that compromised my computer's security.

Thankfully, this application identified it and got rid of it.

Now, here are the minor problems I have with Trend Micro Internet Security: First, even if I set the application to only update at a specific time it will sometimes update immediately after reboot even if it has already updated the security software that day. This is good if you want to make sure your security files/virus definitions are up to date, but it stinks if you don't want the program downloading updates all the time.

Second, depending on the number of start-up applications I have running on my system, Trend Micro Internet Security Pro sometimes generates a strange error message telling me to stay off the internet until my parents have changed the parental controls. I'm a 31-year-old adult who is married and has a kid of his own. I disabled the parental controls (because my 2-year-old isn't using the computer yet) but I still get this strange error message about 50% of the time when I start up my computer. If the parental controls have been disabled (turned off) I should NOT be getting error messages telling me to stay off the internet until my mommy and daddy fix the computer.

Hopefully these two problems are corrected in a future update.

Overall, I still highly recommend this software for people who want to keep their computer's safe. I just hope the update schedule controls and parental control issues are resolved with a future update from Trend Micro.","Solid security solution, a little buggy, but very good",1226620800,,

Even winrar comes with a trial that never expires, but it will nag you every time you run it. On top of this, you can purchase it online for half the cost of this.

Otherwise, it installed easily enough and it is now my default unzip software. I was happy with it until this morning....

When I logged onto my computer, it said an update was available. No problem, I said to go ahead and download/install the update. After the install, it took me through the installation wizard. I was a little nervous because this is when extra software likes to piggy back onto your computer.

Sure enough, after the install some colorful, round icon appeared on my desktop. I was upset because 1) this is paid software for crying out loud. Fine, try to sneak stuff in when it is free, I get that you need to pay the bills. But this wasn't free, this was $60!! And then even worse is 2) it never prompted me to install this software.

I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.

There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.

The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the ""Classroom in a Book"" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.

One thing I got here more clearly than in the ""Classroom in a Book"" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an ""object based"" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).

Overall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on ""Best Practices"" serves as a useful complement to the ""how to"" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the ""Next Video"" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the ""Next Video"" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. ""Hawaiin"" instead of ""Hawaiian""), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the ""inverseKinematics_start.fla"" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.","A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on ""best practices""",1290816000,,

I got this because the subscription on my existing Norton 360 Multi-Device was ending in a few months. Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Amazon Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not before you go to it.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now.

Each of the most recent three times Microsoft downloaded Windows updates, my PC was unable to reboot or install the updates. Installation stopped about midway. I was eventually able to boot my computer in Safe mode, and from there do a restore operation to return to a previously installed version of my system files. It usually took me about a half day to get up and running again. My guess is that Kaspersky's insistence on doing its own updates during startup has somehow conflicted with Microsoft's update routine. I also noticed that other software installed on my computer was affected by Kaspersky's usurping system files at boot-up. This continuing conflict left me justifiably concerned whether my computer would be trashed and rendered unusable (and non-salvageable) during one of these episodes. Accordingly, I decided not to renew my subscription to Kaspersky (2014) when it expired in April, 2015.

Having now returned to Norton's excellent security program, I have noticed that the startup issue with Microsoft's updates (and other programs) described above has disappeared. Moreover, my PC is now noticeably faster.

If I knew how to type properly instead of the hunt and peck method I use I wouldn't have any need for this product.  I don't use it all that often but when I do it comes in incredibly handy. For example I am using this now to dictate this review. I've had to stop twice now to correct a mistake. Some of that could be caused by the fact I have the Moody blues running in the background on my stereo.

I purchased Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 to replace version 9.  That goes to show how much I like the software.  One of the reasons I wanted to replace version 9 was it was quite buggy.  Sometimes it would crash for no apparent reason, other times the accuracy didn't seem that great.  It also was quite a resource hog, but then again so is version 10.  However I have a pretty good computer with a quad four processor, and three gigs of RAM so it doesn't really pose a problem.  Generally when I'm not using it I shut it off anyway.

I have noticed however that the accuracy and stability is a lot better than version 9. A lot of the quirkiness maybe due to the complexity of the program.  It is a full-featured program albeit with a user-friendly interface. As time goes by I will try tweaking the program a little more.

I cannot comment on the included headset that comes with the software. I am still using my trusty Telex USB headset. I've had this thing for years and it works great so why change.

In conclusion all I can say is I'm happy with the software.  It is very functional, a step up from version 9, and a lifesaver for those that are typing challenged. It does require some effort on the users part, but then again so do most things that are worthwhile.  I would definitely have given it a five star rating if not due to the quirkiness.

Definitely worth $20. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited by socialite Lori Girard to ride West on a historic train in hopes of solving a centuries old mystery. Basically, a rich man named Jake Hurley supposedly left a huge treasure somewhere, only nobody has ever been able to put together all of the clues he left and find it - thats where you, as Nancy, come in. Cause she can solve anything, right? Right. This is a commonly used plot in the ND series, but it was very well executed by Her Interactive. There is the perfect balance of mystery, romance, excitement, history, a bit of spookiness, humor - just about everything you could ask for. A good Nancy Drew game is nothing without a good plot, and this plot ranks up there among the best!

CHARACTERS - 5/5: The characters in this game are a huge improvement over the lackluster characters in SOTOC #12. Each one has their own personality and they're all fun to interact with. Lori Girard is a ditsy socialite who's desperate for attention, Charleena Purcell is a big time romance writer who we met in Secret of Shadow Ranch (She's a little annoying IMO), John Grey is the host of ghost chaser show, but his character doesn't really do anything, Tino Balducci is a hot-shot detective who got his big break when he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and Frank and Joe Hardy are, as always, fun to talk to and very helpful. My favorite character in this game was Fatima from the gift shop - she was soo funny! ""It's FATIMA, with an F, none of that freaky PH stuff!"" Hahahahaah!

SETTING - 5/5: The train was very beautiful. Very antique and a bit creepy at times, it fit the time period when it was built perfectly. All of the train cars were really well done. The gift shop and Copper Gorge was nice, too. The morgue was bit creepy - as it should be, but there wasn't much to explore there. And the desert at the end was very life-like. You could tell that a lot of work was put into this game. I only wish that there was more to explore at Copper Gorge, but we can't have everything I guess.

PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles in this game were a lot harder than the last one. Which is good, cause the last game was pretty easy. Some of the puzzles were really easy and repetitive (all those pipes!), and some were really complicated. Plus there were some puzzles that were really simple but just hard to do. It was a good balance between easy and hard. I used a walkthrough for this game a lot more than the last game, because some of the puzzles (like those dolls) were just too confusing for me. But overall the puzzles were really good!

IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yes, especially the first time you play it. On a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give it a 4, but if you're really good at puzzles it might not be so hard for you.

ENDING - 5/5: I'd say that the maze at the end is pretty easy, but the memorizing part (for me, at least) was challenging. I died more than a few times trying to figure it out. But the culprit was really unexpected and had an interesting motive. The escape at the end was like a roller coaster, I just thought it was awesome! Very well done!

Yes I had to use Word at school and I had to use Word at work.

But there is something about WordPerfect that draws me to it.  Admittedly the first computer I ever had came with WordPerfect and that is really what I learned to type on, but it is more then that.

The thing I find is that while WordPerfect and the other suite programs take a little bit more time to learn and understand, once you get the basic ideas ow how things are laid out, it is so much easier to to use WordPerfect, Quattro and Presentations.

Getting to the functions you want is easier, and more intuitive.  I don't find myself hunting through menus and boxes to find the changes I want to make.

Also the help functions are soooo much better.  When you do a help search on Microsoft, you basically get a web search for whatever words you entered, with WordPerfect you get actual useful answers and tutorials on how to do what you are trying to do.

Also with WordPerfect you have the option to save files directly to PDF (A Must have nowadays if you ask me) and you have a program called paperport that lets you scan in papers and convert them, a really nice program.

While I am still forced to do much of my work on Word, I find myself more and more using WordPerfect saving and then just converting the files to MS Word or excel.  A little extra work, but still easier then using the Microsoft products.

TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

The one negative for this program is that the publisher used to offer free e-filing for the state return as well as federal but has dropped that for the 2008 edition.  With a charge weighing in a whopping $19.95 for e-filing each state return, this is not a trivial fee.  I would recommend filing state returns manually unless you will receive a refund large enough to make getting the check a week or so faster worth that extra money.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns. Most people will need both, but if you live in a state with no income tax then you'll want to look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-e-file/dp/B001HO6Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + e-file</a>&nbsp;for considerably less money.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own.

I don't know exactly, but I've been using it at least since the early nineties, so I've been using it almost from the start.

The school where I studied digital illustration, design and animation used mostly Adobe products on Macs. At the time, I'd take what I'd learned, go home, and then do the same thing with CorelDraw on my computer. I quickly discovered that there are two, maybe three, major differences between CorelDraw and those other programs.

1. CorelDraw Graphics Suite gives you several programs--like a vector-design program and a photo-manipulation program--in one and doesn't make you pay extra for filters and other features that should be included.

2. CorelDraw Graphics Suite is a lot cheaper than the full version of even one of those products. (Check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-CS6/dp/B007R0RKV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop CS6</a>&nbsp;to compare, and remember that Photoshop doesn't include a vector-design program.)

3. Most other illustrators and graphic designers still prefer Adobe products. I have no idea why, but they often look down on CorelDraw.

The fact is that there's nothing you can do with those other programs that you can't do with CorelDraw Graphic Suites. I once met a woman who ran a design studio, and she told me all the designers who worked under her used Adobe products--but she preferred to fix their work in CorelDraw. We both agreed it was the better program.

Why would you want to pay more to get less?

If you're an illustrator or artist looking for something that does a better job of imitating brushes and the like, I'd recommend a different Corel product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Painter-12/dp/B004YHXXKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Painter 12</a>.

I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.

Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.

So, after roughly another year of ""living on the edge"", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).

Here's what I noticed:
+ Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute.
+ Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick.
+ Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.

About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.

So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!",No longer a resource hog,1349136000,,

Eventually, I gave up on Omnipage and instead purchased the full Adobe Acrobat, which has Optical Character Recognition (OCR) built in.

I think the software is decent, the price is not too bad, and it has a neat control panel. In other words, if you've been using Trend Micro for years, and it works for you - I'm not trying to talk you out of it.

The problem for me is, I don't know why I would ever be compelled to buy it. It's inferior to the free options out there. So if you're looking for the best protection, there is no single option that will cover all your bases. But fortunately, the best rated programs are all free.

Here's what our IT staff recommends:

* For Anti-Virus: Either AVAST or AVIRA. Both free, both fairly equivalent in protection, in speed, in program size, etc. They will give you some annoying popups asking if you want to upgrade, but the basic home version is both adequate & free.

* For Firewall: If using Windows XP, 7, or Vista, just enable the Windows Firewall. In tests, the Windows Firewall does as well as others. Never run two firewall programs, as this can cause problems. If using an older version of Windows, use Zone Alarm (also free). Also, your router acts as a secondary firewall (even if you only have one computer hooked up).

* For hijacks, redirects, popups, & malicious web sites: Use HostsMan. This tiny little program (also free) amazingly keeps a list of malicious sites and prevents them from loading on your browser.

* For emergencies: Install these programs just in case - Spybot Search & Destroy, C-Cleaner, & Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. Run C-Cleaner once a week - to keep your system running optimally, to clean up unwanted files, and clean your registry. The other two programs are to run just in case you have a problem, and it's super handy to already have them on your computer in case a virus or hijack is preventing internet access.

So I can't really recommend the Trend Micro, but I'll go ahead and share my experience with it:

-Install was a nightmare process, slows down boot time, bulky program.

-I really don't like the free online backup, because you are forced to renew every 12 months. In my opinion it's a marketing gimmick to get you to renew, when there are many options out there which are better (and free). For important files, I back up manually on Google Docs. For bookmarks, backup on Google Bookmarks. For backup of everyday programs and files, there are about a dozen reliable (and light) programs out there.

-Does not block some of the malicious sites, hijacks, and redirects out there. Instead, make sure you use HostsMan.

7928,1,False,"05 7, 2014",A2U80U8KAR1DL,B00EFRME1C,,Bill_IT,"Having used Acronis for a few years, I find I can no longer recommend it because of the manufacturer's uncaring attitude about the need to fix an intrusive bug that has been in existence for at least two years. It is commonly referred to as the ""Operations in Progress"" bug. I sense that Acronis regards it as a ""feature,"" not a ""bug.""

The problem is with the backup scheduler. Often security-conscious people connect USB drives only for the purpose of making full backups; then they disconnect them to keep them truly safe from power surges, fire, viruses, and other catastrophes--sometimes storing the backups in a vault or off-site. Indeed, this is considered a ""best practice"" in the IT field. So strongly is this practice recommended that a security audit of a computer site will typically call out the operation for not having at least some of its backups stored off-site. Yet, the Acronis backup scheduler always assumes that the backup should be connected. When you attempt to shut down the computer on a day that a backup is set to occur, if the external drive is not connected, suddenly a message will appear during shutdown stating: ""Operations are in Progress...Please Wait...."" And wait, and wait, and wait.

The message causes confusion because it appears to be a Windows message and is not identified as being displayed by Acronis software. Moreover, it does not state what is really going on. The message means: ""Acronis is trying to access your external USB drive and will continue to try forever."" This freezes the shutdown process, because the software is so lame that it does not time out. Eventually, you will have to physically power down the computer.

This has messed up Windows Updates a few times, because Windows update activities often occur during the shutdown and reboot processes.

One would hope that there would be a workaround. Why not set the scheduler to ""never"" do a backup? Tried that, but strangely, the scheduler does not retain a setting of ""never""--it actually flips back to a default schedule cycle. It's as if the person writing this code wants to FORCE the customer into having a regular backup scheduling cycle. OK, what about disabling the scheduler process through msconfig? If you do that, Acronis True Image simply won't work. It has to have the scheduling process running in order to do a backup.

A web search on ""operations in progress Acronis"" will reveal the widespread irritation and inconvenience this bug has caused. Acronis has yet to come up with a solution that actually works.

It is ironic that a company specializing in a computer security product would work AGAINST the safest way of handling backups on a customer's own, variable schedule based on actual need--to disconnect and safely store the backup medium when the backup has completed. Again: the advantage of having a secure backup is eroded if the backup medium cannot be stored in a safe place away from the computer.

Do such catastrophes occur? Yes, all the time. That's why we make backups! I have personally seen cases where power surges have traveled through connecting cables to peripheral equipment and have fried them all. Not to speak of fires, floods, tornadoes, theft, etc.

By contrast, Acronis has done years of backups and several restores without incident, and has a clever disk cloning operation that seamlessly clones to a different-sized disk.

The bottom line is: customers should not have to put up with this. If the code is written well, it should be simple and inexpensive to add a timeout of, say one minute. Or to change the settings to truly allow the scheduler to be turned off. The ""Operations in Progress"" message could be changed to something meaningful. Or preferably, Acronis should implement all three of these solutions. They could be distributed to existing customers as an update. But it hasn't happened.

It comes in four separate discs. So be prepared to take a while to install these as you have to keep putting one in after another. A better way to do this should have been to put it all on one disc with one serial number instead of four different discs.

I started trying out the Create It! first since I usually will adjust pictures I have taken. I found this one to be extremely slow to open and I accidentally had set the default program to open JPEGs as Create It! This means, I can't just scroll through my album of pictures and it took a long time for this come up. I've had many times that it took so long that it timed out on itself and it had to shut itself down.

I was excited about the Scrapbook disc since it says it also makes cards and I love to make cards. I found it to be really more for scrapbook pages more than anything. And I had a hard time getting a good looking enough card for my purposes. So I gave up on it and went back to my old Microsoft Word method of creating cards.

The other two discs were OK. I tried some pictures with it. It was fairly simple to use but doesn't do too much besides changing a picture into a painting and that's it. There wasn't anything in there to really enhance it.

This was a good idea for sure but the way it was executed was done a little poorly. There should be just one disc instead of four discs and I just wish they made the programs to not bog down computer resources as much. Just so everyone knows, I have a Quad Core processor, 4GB ram, 64 bit windows 7 and it still really slowed down my computer and took forever to open.",Nice package idea but slows down the computer drastically,1298419200,,
12528,4,False,"04 5, 2013",ACQYIC13JXAOI,B004XO6V1G,,Tooncesmom,"As a former designer with over 10,000 hours of CADAM experience, I was interested to learn whether Corel's CAD program would be a good substitute for AutoCAD. While I no longer draft and design for a living, I have an occasional use for rendering drawings, both mechanical and architectural, and CorelCAD is considerably less expensive than AutoCAD. Plus, I have the experience with years of use of other Corel Suite programs.

I found installation of CorelCAD to be somewhat problematic since there's no guidelines other than the installation disk. It took several minutes for Virtual Studio 2.0 to install on my XP SP3 machine (3.3Ghz processor, 3.24GB RAM). At the point of registration I got an error message, however, following the guidelines listed by another reviewer, I was able to reboot and find the program functional.

Working with CorelCAD is quite different than CADAM where a stylus is used, however, both the cursor and typed commands replace the stylus, and after a short time and watching a couple of CorelCAD tutorials, I was able to begin a simple drawing.

I like being able to open, work with and save files in the DWG format, and I appreciate the customizable 2D and 3D design tools offered. Smart Editing lets me re-size, reposition, align and copy entities in seconds.  The Properties Palette allows me to layer, color and even copy properties from other entities. I have yet to try intersecting solid entities or use any of the more complex 3D operations, however, as I progress I will report of my findings. I am working with a Windows platform and prefer the DWG format though it also supports DXF and DWF formats.

One negative is that it takes an inordinately (well, maybe only seconds, but it seems too long) long time for the CorelCAD screen to appear after clicking on the icon, also the My Drawings folder that is created in the My Documents directory is a bit tedious to make changes to. It could be my older Dell computer that's the problem, but time will tell.

I have never used AutoCAD, but my experience with CADAM is only moderately helpful in operating and understanding CorelCAD. Thank goodness for the tutorials! I expect to move from novice to adequate user in a short time. More documentation seems to be on the way; it has ever been thus for Corel's other programs.

Note: check your software. There's a 2012 upgrade you can install. Here's the info from their website. ""If your version is anything lower than 12.4.056 you should download and install the revised update to benefit from an update notification within CorelCAD when the next update will be released in the future.
There is no need to uninstall the previous version of the software - the revision will update/ replace any previous version of CorelCAD.""

My main concerns were protecting a laptop and netbook running Windows 7, and for that application this is an ideal solution.

First of all, installation was a snap. I installed RS on a Mac running OS X Leopard, and had no problem at all. It takes a long time, though, so be prepared to wait or even walk away from the computer for a while during installation. I decided to try using the Mac's built-in mic instead of the headset provided with the software, and found that it worked well. Of course, this would not be a good idea if there is a lot of noise near your computer. You may have trouble hearing the lessons, and RS would probably not do well judging your pronunciation.

You have a choice of how the Japanese words will display on your screen. If you are primarily interested in learning spoken Japanese, you might choose to have the text display using characters from the English alphabet, as that could help you to more easily recognize and pronounce the phrases.

Japanese is, obviously, very different from English, and I was unsure how well I could follow even the basic lessons. Turns out, it was simple due to the repetition built in to the Rosetta Stone system. The first time I heard a word or phrase it didn't necessarily stick with me, but by the end of the lesson it had sunk in. That has turned out to be key in helping me to learn this unfamiliar language.

Although each phrase is repeated several times, it wasn't boring. The phrases are mixed up a bit each time, and by paying attention and working through the lesson you start to understand a little more each time you use the software.

One thing that makes a difference in how much I retain is working the lessons consistently. Do not expect that you will spend a few minutes once or twice a week and really learn the language. Plan on spending time nearly every day, and the more time you can spare, the better. Half an hour or more a day would be ideal.

Although everyone has a different learning style, I believe that Rosetta Stone can work for many people who are comfortable with independent learning. It is certainly much better than audio-only, and allows you to learn and practice on your own schedule, unlike a class.",Repetition Works. Repetition Works. Repetition Works.,1227052800,,

When I first converted from a PC, I found myself stumbling around the 2004 applications looking for things.  The 2007 release of MS Office changed to a ""ribbon"" interface that is similar to the toolbar setup of MS 2008 for Mac.  It should make for a smoother transition for new MS Office for Mac users.  But besides that, the interface for 2008 is neater and more organized.  I've also found the performance to be much faster than the previous version, and not as prone to crashing.

At home, I use MS Office 2008 for Mac for editing and reviewing work files.  I also use the Excel to keep track of personal spreadsheets.  I find both of these very easy to use and love having the ability to have these programs on my Macintosh.  A student version of the program probably would have been sufficient for me based on my past use.  While I do not need the functionality at home, the stripping of the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is an issue for some users that they should consider before upgrading.  There is also no Analysis Toolpak, which again is only a concern for higher-level users.

However, the Microsoft Project Gallery is a great new application that I did not have on my 2004 student version of the MS Office software.  You can create business cards, brochures, flyers, calendars, stationary, resumes, envelopes, labels, etc.  It's kind of like a bonus ""PrintShop"" being bundled with the software... but with some very professional - and also some fun, sleek -templates.  The 2008 version also adds Microsoft Exchange capability to the e-mail program Entourage - a huge plus for those who use Microsoft Outlook at work and what to sync their e-mail at home.

Overall, I highly recommend this product.  I would recommend that you research the differences between each version of MS Office 2008 for Mac prior to purchase.

The start screen features a nicely organized menu, everything is on one page, WordPerfect, clipart, fonts, images, Corel Win Zip and other bonus and trial programs.

Both the initial installation and later add-on installations went smoothly, and when I opened WordPerfect, right away I was reminded why I've always preferred it to Microsoft Word: In a word, Control.  In WordPerfect, you can see the codes, see the formatting, and therefore make the precise changes you want.  For example, in WordPerfect you can move margins with a single click and drag.  On the other hand, Word always seems to play ""hide the ball"" when it comes to these details.  That dumb little paper clip thinks he knows what I want better than me?  I don't think so, I'll take it from here, little guy.  X6 does have lots of new macros, and the QuickCorrect and Format-as-You-Go features are available as in earlier versions, but if you want simple control of all aspects of your document, nothing beats WordPerfect.

The X6 upgrades I like most are: Enhanced e-book publishing - one click and your document converts to MOBI format, more PDF functions with easier format conversion, I mentioned lots of new macros, and there's a feature that better supports multiple views and monitors.

Anytime you may hand someone a folder of documents (in business, organizations, etc...) you can think about handling the user a ""zip"" file of the same electronic documents.  When thought of this way, it makes sense to communicate to people with zip files (or folders) instead of collections of documents.  Now, instead of sending people 10 seperate files via email, you can easily organize them into these ""zip"" folders, and then share the compressed file via email.

While standard Windows/Mac has the ability to compress files (or open them) for free, these solutions have limitations.  For instance, while you can archive a single folder into a zip file, you have to manually repeat this process if you have a batch of folders that need to be individually compressed at once.  The WinZip command-line interface allows you to process batches of files with a single set of commands.

If you company supports them, this software has additional features that aren't supported by Microsoft.  For instance, out-of-the-box MS SharePoint does support the checking-in and checking-out of ZIP files.  This comes in handy where you want to check in a folder of documents, vs a single document.  A properly configured SharePoint sites (where a separate WinZip Express for SharePoint program is installed by an admin), you can utilize zip files for check-in and check-out.

The big question is whether or not to purchase the Standard or Pro (reviewed) version.  From looking at WinZip's website, the main differences deal with the ability to manipulate photos, and in the ability to run automated backups.  If neither of these features are of interest to you, consider saving some money and purchasing the Standard version.

If you regularly use compressed files (or think you could benefit from them), I suggest you 1) download the evaluation copy direct from WinZip, and then 2) buy the software.",Sometimes built-in (PC or MAC) isn't enough.  That's where WinZip comes in,1397692800,,

This seemed like a strange question, since I knew that this individual had been drawing lines in Office for a decade or more. I went to MIT, and have been using Office since before it was Office, starting with Word in 1986, so I was confident that between the two of us we'd figure it out.

Wrong!

The engineer wanted to draw a line between two objects. He did NOT want this line to snap to one of the connection points on these objects. In other words, he wanted a LINE, not a CONNECTOR in Office 2003 lingo. Connectors are fun little things for drawing org charts, but we wanted a plain old LINE.

We tried every variety of line or arrow we could find. Every one snapped to the connection points. After 10 minutes (at our combined billing rate, more than the cost of Microsoft Office), we resorted to the documentation.

We found the answer! The icon for LINE is not a LINE. It is a blobular shape with a right angle on the bottom and a curvy part on top, called a ""Freeform"". It turns out that all other line-shaped tools have been promoted to connectors, and Freeform is the only tool you can use to draw a line that is NOT a connector. This is a bit awkward, since a line has two ends, and a freeform has infinite inflection points, so you have to double click at the end of your freeform to indicate that you just want a simple two-point line.

Wow!

I am really not interested in becoming the tech support guy who has to retrain experienced, educated people that ""When you want a line, choose the blobular tool called 'freeform' because that's what Bill Gates says you should do."" I wonder what Microsoft could have accomplished with their development dollars if they had focused on real enhancements instead of changing lines to blobular freeform thingies. We're loyal Office users, but we won't be buying any new copies this time around. Maybe they'll get it right in Office 2010.",Microsoft has hit new low in ease (difficulty) of use,1197936000,330,

The device got it right every time on the interstate, but on local roads it consistently said I was speeding when I wasn't, and there was a variance of 10mph in many cases.  Additionally when looking at the ""route replay"" feature on the app my tracks did NOT match the roads on those rural roads, in a few cases I was driving between 2 roads, in a few other cases it had me on the next road over, the accuracy for me was NOT reliable.

This IS useful to get data on your braking and driving, but after my use of this I would highly recommend you NOT use this as the judgement of whether you punish your teen, fire an employee, etc. It's simply not as accurate as it should be in my test scenarios, and I state again, I did these tests solely monitoring my own driving, I was not observing anyone else's driving and then took their word for the results, this was done carefully in different controlled scenarios.","It's a good concept, but 50% of the time I used it in rural and residential areas it was wrong.",1470700800,16,

I spent a couple hours researching the various options and decided on this Webroot Internet Security Complete 2016.

Before installing (from disc) I made sure to do a complete uninstall of Kaspersky so I would not have issues during install.
I installed this on my desktop (HP, Windows 7) and laptop (also HP, Windows 7) and had no problems with installation at all.  The disc did not auto run on either so I opened up the file folder and started it manually (select WRSetupCD).

It was a very quick install, took about 7 minutes on each computer and that included the initial scan it does during installation.  I did an additional scan just to be sure after install and that took 1 minute and 24 seconds.

During set up it asks you to review and accept agreement.  It asks for your email address.  It gives you the option to receive special offers and newsletter from them or not to.

Pros
+ Reasonably priced
+ Very quick install
+ User-friendly interface.  Very easy to navigate and understand what you are seeing.
+ Not obtrusive.  Doesn't slow down my computers or interfere with performance at all
+ Quick scans
+ Useful Utilities (System Optimizer cleans up files and System Analyzer lets you know ways you can improve your computer's performance)

There is an unusually high percentage of negative review on this product, hopefully what I can offer may help:

1. Having owned every version of Quicken (I bought Ver. 1 on a 5.25"" DOS floppy directly from the originator), I have quite a bit of experience with the product.  The early generations were essentially a form-filler for printing checks on your dot matrix printer and keeping track of your checkbook register.  The latest versions try to do much more.

2. My copy of 2013 installed without a hitch.  Unlike previous versions it does NOT let you do a fresh install if it senses that there is a previous version on your computer, and it does NOT let you pick which backup file you would like restored.  I consider this a negative.  On a positive note on this subject, it DOES restore all user preferences ... older versions would always make you reset such things as what the ""enter"" key does and basic printer settings.

3. Sigh, there is precious little to justify spending up to $100 on a ""new"" version.  It looks, acts and works virtually identical to last year's version.  As expected, the glitches some reviewers experienced in early releases have been addressed ... Quicken forces the software to do an upgrade to the latest generation before you can even use it.  So far it has updated itself to Ver. 8 of the 2013 app.

4. I was shocked when I saw the price of checks from Quicken.  I recall 250 checks being about $30.  Now they are about $150.  For 250 sheets of paper?!?!?!??!?

5. Since I got my first smartphone a couple of years ago I was amazed that Quicken didn't have a smartphone app.  Okay, now they finally do and it is so useless I can't believe it.  It does NOTHING.  You can't withdraw, deposit, pay, or any other of the most basic functions of banking from it.  From what I can see it tells you what your balance is (but no, it really doesn't ... my checking account has an overdraft line of credit, and Quicken includes that in calculating my cash balance).  So if I have $2000 in available funds and $4000 in overdraft protection, Quicken tells me I have $6000 liquid cash available.  There is NO way to adjust that.

6. More on the useless smartphone app ... I installed it on the first day of the month.  It told me what my income-to-date and expenditures-to-date were.  FOR THE ONE DAY!!!!  I can't set it to tell me what those values are for the past 30, 60, 90 days or year-to-date or any other useful function; only what they are for THIS month.  Useless.

7. More on the smartphone app ... oh, never mind.  It was the #1 reason I upgraded to Ver. 2013 and I will probably end up never using it.

8. I suspect some of the less-than-positive reviews were due to early release glitches in the app.  So far Quicken 2013 has ""upgraded"" itself 8 times and I find Ver 8 to be as stable as I could expect.

If I had to give up every app I own except one, the one I would keep would be Quicken.  If you have previous versions I doubt it you will find anything substantial to justify buying this newer version.  If you have never used Quicken, I think you will end up like me finding it indispensable.","Still an excellent app, but is the upgrade worth it?",1354147200,8,

My plan was to upgrade from Win 7 Home Premium to Ultimate and, with the added features and security, stay there as long as possible. But, actually I found that to get there was more getting improbable than I imagined, or just unfeasible. I had waited too long to do those Win 7 upgrades. Microsoft was no longer offering them. There were no bargains left. With what looked like bargains, I was seeing too many people getting burned with counterfeit copies of software.

Office 2003 gives you what you already have in Office XP (and a few earlier versions) so learning how to use it is never going to be a problem.  In virtually every way the program looks and feels like the previous Office versions.

There are improvements although I am not sure how much a home user will need the XML functionality.

True Image allowed me to do all of the above in about one hour, saving me countless hours of painful patching, reinstalling and reconfiguring.
____________________________
DISK CLONING:

The Utilities section has a 'clone' option that would copy EVERYTHING, including the Master Boot Record/Sector (MBR) from the puny 60GB drive unto the 500GB while allowing me to control the size of the active partition - this while the 500GB was connected through a USB wire and the laptop booted off the program's CD.

Once the operation completed (50 minutes) I simply removed the old 60GB drive off my laptop and replaced it with the 500GB drive. Once the laptop was turned back on it booted up happily, with a 200GB master partition and a 300GB second partition. There are 3 words that I have to use to describe the process: PERFECTION and COMPLETE SATISFACTION. This capability alone is worth the price of this product.

True Image even offers the option to completely clean up the old drive - for privacy - once the cloning completes - I did not dare to that but I may do it later.
____________________________

The backup/restore/recovery/protection features are numerous and they allow for a great deal of flexibility. I will probably add to this review later, after I become more familiar with them - there is a 135-page manual to read. At this time, I set up a backup schedule that would work while the computer is idle, whenever the external storage media happens to be plugged in.

Additional utilities include:

- Drive cleanser - remove confidential information.
- File shredder - completely erases the selected files.
- System cleanup - destroys all traces of usage history.
- Try and decide - which I haven't tried yet, would allow me to install 'stuff' I find on the Internet and, if anything bad happens or I don't like what I got, it will restore my environment to what it was before I got myself adventurous.

I wish it was possible to grant this product more than 5 stars. This is a MUST HAVE for those who wish to replace the drive that came with their laptop and not go through the pain and frustrations associated with reinstalling and reconfiguring everything.

When we use Microsoft Outlook, A weather report is compulsorily displayed in the center of the upper part of the screen. This is an absolute deterioration. The very useless information is displayed in the most important place. It is too user-experience.

Many icons are made into monochrome. In Office 2010, users can distinguish many icons with their color. So, Office 2013 became very inconvenient. It is too user-experience.

Excel 2013 often displays an error [Operation was stopped] and it is forced to terminate.

<FAQ (Frequent Answers and Questions)>
Question: You recommend Office 2010, but the support term is shorter than later version.

Amswer: No problem. Any problem cannot be found, even if the support period passes. Because this is a typical sales promotion called [a support end fraud].

Microsoft always forces purchasing latest products for end of support period. However, how many injury occured? The answer is [zero]. You can confirm it with retrieving the information in the Internet. Informational underdogs are being deceived by the sales promotion. Even if you suffered from a victim, the amount of damage is much less than [the cost of the installation for the useless software].

3784,4,True,"01 20, 2010",A1T1YSCDW0PD25,B001E5Q8CO,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},Lantana Al,"Pros:
* Easy and automatic daily backup of all your Windows computers
* Easy file sharing
* Familiar Windows GUI
* Great for non-techies but only after it's setup correctly
* Low system requirements by today's standards
* Easily add to storage by just adding drives to make one ""big pot"" of storage
* Easily set up a shared folder that duplicates files across more than one HD in case one HD fails (just toggle a setting)

Cons:
* BEWARE! When upgrading to an SSD, I found out that WHS would not restore to a smaller partition than the original. Instead, I had to use Acronis TrueImage to do this - which worked great, BTW.
* The restore disc did not detect any network interfaces on a Dell 1525 notebook... so a bit of a hassle since correct drivers would have to be found for it to restore.
* Terrible policy of having to do a ""server reinstallation"" to use an OEM key when you use the trial version. This loses all your settings and installed programs but supposedly not your data... plus you have to download and install a ton of updates (80+ as of mid Jan 2010, and then another 9 on the ""second pass""), all over again.
* Not only the above, but also had to reinstall the connector on all the machines to get the connection back to the server. Very disappointing.
* Driver problems - some drivers may be non-existent or difficult to get. I had to stick an old 10/100 Intel network card in the machine so that it could get on the Internet and get the right network drivers for my Gigabyte motherboard (Marvell Yukon 88E8056). And I had to do this TWICE because I had to do the server reinstallation.
* If you have to deal with what I did, then setup could take you a lot longer than you'd expect.
* Can't easily use a USB external drive to backup your Windows Home Server if you also want to backup the backups. I wanted to backup everything, including the backups, to a 2TB ioSafe waterproof/fireproof external USB HD but it would only backup the shares and not the backups. However, it seems this can be done manually so I created a script to copy the data directory to the external ioSafe drive and I will set this script to run weekly. Take a look at the Microsoft Technical Brief on Backup and Restore on what to do.
* No easy encryption, especially to external USB drives where you might want it more, but you might be able to use TrueCrypt to provide encryption.
* Difficulty activating even after a server reinstallation - got message number 32777 - had to fiddle with Internet Explorer settings to get it to work - see Microsoft Support Article 816897 if you have this problem too

The Test:
* I'm simulating a failure by changing out the SSD in a Gateway T-6836 with Intel T5750 CPU notebook computer running Vista x64 (changing from an OCZ 60GB Solid to a Kingston 40GB SSD that uses the Intel 2nd generation controller).
* I downloaded the latest WHS Restore CD (2009-11-23) from Microsoft and installed it. It placed a CD ISO image in the installation directory and I used the Windows Disc Image Burner tool (included in Windows 7) to burn the CD.
* I removed the old OCZ SSD from the notebook and installed the new Kingston one.
* I booted from the restore CS and it asked me if I was restoring a computer with less than 512MB of memory or 512MB or more of memory (shouldn't it be able to figure this out?) - I have more than 512MB so I chose that option.
* Looks like it booted into a version of Vista.
* It asked me about drivers - looks like all the needed drivers were already available (good) - otherwise I had the option to provide/install them.
* It looked for my Windows Home Server and found it - then asked me for the WHS password.
* It asked me what computer to restore and from which backup day. It defaulted to the correct computer.
* It asked me some questions about the restore disk and I had the option to use a ""Disk Manager"" but I didn't.
* Restore started about 2:58PM and finished (reported SUCCESSFULLY) about 3:36 PM so about 38 minutes to restore 28.7GB of used space according to the properties dialog for the C drive (The new SSD is a value SSD and has a slow sequential write speed of about 40MB/s - its biggest downside).
* FINAL RESULT: It works smoothly! I did not run into any problems that can be attributed to WHS while restoring the system. Couldn't have been much simpler.

Other:
* Based on Windows Server 2003
* Giving it 4 stars out of 5 because once it is setup, it's easy to use and works well, but the setup and activation itself was very poor.
* I installed RealVNC so I could access the desktop easily. I prefer it over the Microsoft provided solution (Remote Desktop).",Good - but room for improvement - DIFFICULT SETUP - BE WARY OF THE TRIAL VERSION,1263945600,3,

I've tried them myself, and they provide an acceptable level of service- great news, considering the price. However, after a terrible experience with a well-known security product several years ago (see my other reviews for details), I swore off all security programs, deciding instead to be vigilant with my machines and my internet activities as a better way to protect my machines. Recently, though, I've tried several new products, and haven't had any major issues with any of them (though there have been some minor frustrations- see below). AVG Internet Security 2011 is the best I've seen, though, by far.

After test-driving Norton 360 on my 'junk' machine, and being frustrated with the way it tends to make decisions FOR the user, instead of giving the user options on how to handle potential threats, I was hoping to find a product that would be equally vigilant in detecting potential issues without taking the machine over. AVG Internet Security 2011 does just that. As you may know, some programs register 'false-positives' with security software- they are safe programs, but they exhibit some characteristics that trigger suspicion. That's fine- if my security software thinks there may be a threat, I want to know about it. However, some security software (like Norton) take the initiative of deleting or quarantining automatically, and this can be very frustrating. AVG engages the user at every juncture, presenting options to clean, delete, or make exemptions for such software. This is very helpful.

More generally, AVG runs silently, it doesn't use up a lot of resources, and its notification system is great- notices are displayed as corner pop-ups that don't distract, but are easy to review if desired. I never really had any issues before I got AVG, and haven't had any since, but it's great to know I'm protected without having to sacrifice performance or worry about the program doing something I don't want it to without my knowledge.

In brief, AVG Internet Security 2011 is a sound investment, and the fact that customer service is available makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the free versions. Highly recommended for anyone looking for effective, non-intrusive security for their PC.",Everything a security progam should be- effective without being instrusive,1300233600,,

I am by no means a power user. I basically use Quicken as an over glorified checkbook, and it has been an excellent program for my purposes. I started using Quicken when I had a free basic version on my first computer, a Packard Bell. Generally, as a rule I upgrade to the next version every two or three years, however, when I was offered an upgrade to 2013 on the Amazon Vine program my interest was piqued. The main reason I went with the upgrade was for Quicken mobile. The main program pretty much operates the way all my other Quicken programs have in the past, virtually the same interface, same functions, same tools. The main difference that I have found is in the search feature is a little different but not too daunting. Now on to the main reason I upgraded to 2013..... The Quicken mobile. I now have it installed on my iPhone and Kindle fire. I have yet to delve into all its intricacies and is trying to figure out how it works. There is a learning curve, but in all honesty, if I cannot figure out the Quicken mobile part of it. I am no further behind than when I started, it's the same great Quicken program. As I stated before, I mainly use it as an over glorified checkbook and that excels in that regards. The other part of Quicken that I rely heavily on is the bill pay service. This works so much better than the old-fashioned way..... Getting a bill in the mail, opening the envelope, writing a check, attaching a stamp, and going to the post office to mail it. Now I get all my bills online (except for a couple of Luddites), and do all my bill paying via Quicken 2013. When I am on the road for a couple of weeks at a time I take my laptop computer with my Quicken program. That way if I need to pay any bills it is not a problem. As I have stated previously, I am not a power user of the Quicken program. I do not use budgeting, account management (except for my bank accounts), investment tracking, etc. For those that want a more robust financial program with all the bells and whistles, this is it. I am by no means a computer or financial wizard, just a truck driver looking for a better way to manage his finances, and Quicken 2013 fills the bill in that department.

After months of ambivalence (and waiting for the supposed automatic offer), I decided to upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 on three computers: One desktop with 4 GB of memory with Vista Ultimate, a laptop with Vista home premium and 2GB memory, and an 8 yearold but highly reliable CPU with only 256MB memory. Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.

Similarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.

In the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.

Like security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering. The latter mentioned features are available as add-on packs accessible from Symantec's website. This version also enhances network monitoring capabilities and expands supported media for backups. Curiously, and incongruently, while network attached storage devices like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Netgear-RND2150-ReadyNAS-Duo-500-GB-Desktop-Network-Attached-Storage/dp/B0013G04AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Netgear RND2150 ReadyNAS Duo 500 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage</a>&nbsp;are discovered by network monitoring, automatic backup to the same device is not supported. It should also be noted the only qualitative difference I can see between the standard version and the premier version of 2.0 is the increased online secure backup storage of  10GB in the case of the premier edition. Standard edition availability is 2GB and in my opinion neither is sufficient. As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders. Essentially, while backup to ipods is intriguing, I see little advantage to employing this backup facility over the functionality existent in both XP and Vista operating systems.

The network monitoring feature is beneficial but is flawed to the extent multiple devices connected to a single access point  like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-HD-Gaming-5-GHz-Wireless-N-Networking-Kit-WNHDEB111/dp/B00126R3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)</a>&nbsp;are not individually distinguishable. Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.

This version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and ""identity safe security"" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.

And then there was the upgrade on my older PC...

In spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.

First and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.

Although during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.

Finally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.

So now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed. Of course...my install of Microsoft Office suite has been damaged so I have time to type this on another computer while I wait for the re-install to finish...",The Dickensian install,1223596800,,

Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.

But PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.

The dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.

PC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!

Its schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.

Its scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new ""Behavior Guard"" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become ""known"" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.

The PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.  This software has actually done what none of the other competitors I've tried could do in the past:  changed my mind for the better about anti-virus software.","A Very Solid Performer, both during Install and Day-to-Day",1231977600,,

It did load my existing FTM tree files with no problem. This latest program loaded on a Windows 7 PC with no problems, and easily updated online when prompted by the installation software. It offers a free, three-month subscription to Ancestry.com, and makes little sense to use Family Tree Maker without Ancestry.com to support it, since Ancestrys archives can find more data on your ancestors -- birth, military and marriage records and so forth. However, the user should remember that Ancestry will want the users credit-card information and, if the user doesnt opt out or upgrade in three months, Ancestry will automatically subscribe the user to a new quarter (current price $50.85).

(I find that it sometimes helps to log into your account at Ancestry.com online -- that is to say, through a browser -- and then open FTM).

FTM comes with a helpful, 300-page booklet, a Companion Guide that explains FTMs features, functions and options.

Ive used previous versions of FTM and find this version to be a little easier to view trees and add data for individual ancestors. I still need to open the individuals file to add things like military service, occupation and so forth if the data is on paper or family memories. You can flip back and forth between the tree and the person, but Im still a little cramped by the trees showing a persons direct ancestors and descendants, and those only through one spouse visible at a time. If the person had two or three spouses, with children, its still a little difficult accessing what are separate (and separately invisible) branches.

The merge feature from Ancestry records to your FTM family tree is a very convenient way to combine info on family members, especially if Ancestry points to possible entries in public records. FTM shows this with a leaf symbol on the family members page in the family tree, and clicking on it will bring up a list of Ancestry links to marriage and other public records. This will add to existing family members information and also point out previously-unknown children, siblings, parents. This is a big improvement but the FTM buyer should figure on an investment in Ancestry.com as well.

After about two decades of using Quicken and regularly upgrading, I am kicking Intuit to the curb. I upgrade when I want. Period. The last time was June 2012 for Quicken. There has been nothing in newer versions to make it worthwhile to pay for an upgrade. Intuit / Quicken doesn't like that and tried to strong arm me into purchasing version 2015. Unless it's free, I don't want version 2015. It has nothing for me, but I received notice today that if I don't open my wallet and give them $20, they will take away features from my 2012 version. I have to upgrade or lose the ability to download transactions. In order to continue using that feature, I have to buy it again? Business must be bad to resort to bullying. I'm jumping from Intuit's sinking ship and looking at other options. If I find nothing, I'll rather use a spreadsheet than go back to Quicken. I know that if you give a bully your lunch money today, he'll try to force you again tomorrow and every following day.

About 15 years ago a friend recommended Quicken to help me manage my finances. I haven't been one to jump on the new releases. Quicken Deluxe 2012 is my 3rd upgrade and I am once again not disappointed.

My finances are nothing spectacular. I have a checking and savings accounts with two brick and mortar banks, plus another of each with ING Direct. There are loan accounts for my house and one car. 9 credit cards and 3 brokerage accounts complete my financial picture.

While the capability has been available in previous versions, this is the first time I've used the automatic update feature. I love not having to sign in to each institution's website to get transaction info to enter. Quicken pulls the info for me and presents it in an manner that allows me to accept or edit each individual transaction.

The calendar is one feature I've used and relied on for many years. I credit it for having helped me not miss even one payment in over a decade.

I can't help you compare Quicken to any other finance software, because Quicken is all I've ever used. That said, I can't think of one thing or function that I would like that Quicken doesn't provide.

The one thing that irks me is how dramatically the price has gone up since my last version. 2012 cost me more than double what I paid in 2006. With the exception of the price of the software, I am 100% satisfied.",A Solid Financial Tool (IT WAS),1340323200,2,

BACKGROUND:  I've used Paint Shop Pro for years.  In fact, I began using PSP back in the days of Compuserve when I could download a few shareware programs and my employer paid for any that I wanted to keep.  I'm not a graphics artist, but when I need to do any kind of image editing, I can usually find my way around in PSP to do what I need to do.

WHAT I LIKE:

- Installed easily, boots up without issues
- Seems speedy for the amateur that I am
- Has a full set of functions and features

WHAT COULD BE BETTER

In the old days, making a simple web graphic was easy to do.  PSP is so sophisticated now as a Photoshop replacement, it's sometimes not easy to create a simple graphic.  I wish that there were a rich set of wizard functions that would start with a goal in mind, and then have the wizard walk through all the steps involved.  Sometimes I have a simple goal in mind, but it's hard to know where to begin.

In recent years and recent versions, Norton has streamlined their protection suite and made it less intrusive and less of a processor/memory hog than it use to be. For me, I was using the 2013 version before upgrading to the new 2014 version and while I consider this one of the best computer protection programs out there (in fact, McAfee bought the older virus scan engine from Norton a few years ago because they couldn't build anything better themselves), the 2014 version is only a minor upgrade from the 2013 version I was using.

Symantec's Norton 360 2014 includes a load of protection technologies including antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spam provision, and a good two-way firewall among other things. It also offers a number of extra features aimed at web browsers and mobile devices such as my Android, Norton Mobile Security includes anti-malware, anti-theft, backup and call/SMS blocking.

Norton's interface is a bit bland this year with yellow boxes on a white background with each labelled Security, Identity, Backup and Tune-up Click on any of the blocks and it moves up to reveal a five item menu and if you want more detail, switch to Task view, which breaks down many of the available protections into individual tasks.

One of the best advantages to Norton is that it updates itself every 5-10 minutes in what they call Pulse and safe Web installs into your web browser to provide browsing protection while you surf the net.

One of my favorite things about Norton 360 is Norton Utilities. One of the best ways to keep your computer from slowing down and being bloated is the Tune-up feature that keep your PC cleaned up from leftover files and broken registry entries along with disk optimization, a diagnostic report and a start-up manager. Start up manager allows you to switch off applications that have set themselves to start when your PC does, placing a load on the system that you may want to avoid. Although I found the startup manager pretty similar to doing it yourself through windows, it does provide a simple easy interface for those more novice users.

Norton 360 has a performance view, where the control panel flips and shows events such as downloads which have taken place in the last three months, and the usage of disk and memory on a variety of timescales. These views I found to be limited in their usefulness but can be beneficial if you're trying to isolate a change in your system's performance and correlate with some event.

Symantec provides 2GB of online storage for backup which seems a bit puny compared to other solutions out there. I for one, don't really utilize this feature as my machine has plenty of backup storage.

The scanning speed and efficiency from the 2013 to 2014 versions seem to be very similar with maybe and I say maybe a slight speed increase in the 2014 version.

One of the differences that I notices was power eraser is now more integrated into the suite. Although I have never had an issue and needed to use it, it seemed like a heavy hitter at cleaning out rootkits, although you do have to reboot your machine to be able to scan and do its thing. The one time I tried it, it did alert me to my java being out of date, which I didn't realize, so there was some benefit to at least running it.

One of my past complaints is the yearly renewal feature that cripples the software if you don't renew and that is still a bit of a gripe to me but at least now you can find this suite for a reasonable price than what it use to be.

Installing Norton 360 or in my case upgrading to the new version usually is smooth but I did have a hiccup where I rebooted my machine and though that the program didn't properly install, but in my case it stalled for a few before completing the installation without any further issues.

Pros:

Excellent blocking of dangerous websites
Powerful, intelligent firewall
Accurate spam filtering
Great antivirus and pulse keeps you constantly updated
Great PC tuneup feature
Minor impact on system performance

Cons:

A minor upgrade to the 2013 version which is good on its on merits
Limited usefulness of some of the features, such as performance view.
only 2 gigs of online storage
Yearly renewal
Installs are not always smooth

Even with only minor tweaks, Norton is still one of the best choices of protection software out there and if you can find it for less than 30 bucks it is a good value for money.

I can't say I am especially impressed with this version either, though there are some good things I can say about it regardless.

I have been using Outlook in the workplace as a standard for years now. It integrates with MS Office (another standard in the office, though I use something different at home) and it generally gets the job done, though it is slow about it. I have found that Outlook 2007 is no exception in that regard - this is not a nimble application and it takes a lot of memory and resources to run well. If you have a lot of memory and space that's not really a concern, but it is something about which to be aware.

MS has always done a nice job of putting together applications with a pretty front end, and Outlook has almost always led the way in that regard. Though pretty, Outlook suffers from a very confusing layout in terms of where to find various configuration settings. Making a preference change is rarely just a couple of clicks away; invariably it either requires knowing up front where things are or it requires a lengthy search for the desired setting.

Outlook 2007 adds RSS feeds, a nice feature for those that use them. To be honest, I have not tried this feature so I cannot comment on it. That said, its availability is a nice thing and is something to consider if this capability is something you need or desire.

I fiddled with the Business Contact Manager portion of the application and to me it feels like a light CRM implementation running on the local box. This is a nice thing to have, but unfortunately it is not something I personally need. For a person who relies on keeping track of contacts, sales and other vitals, I can see this as being a very useful tool.

I do appreciate the fact that Outlook 2007 seems to be more stable than the last version I have used, but I do still get the occasional hang when connecting.

So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the ""Yes"" box.

Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.

Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.

In situations that call for more limited input and minimal multitasking (like a tablet or HTPC), Windows 8 actually works fairly well. The issue comes when Microsoft basically forced it onto the desktop workspace, and the fact is that Windows 8 just isn't a desktop OS. The start button is gone, the desktop that we're used to is neutered (really what makes Windows, well, Windows), the native Windows 8 apps are full-screen affairs and as far as the UI goes, it just seems like a major step backward for those who actually work on a PC. Windows 8 basically makes you take a hop, step and a jump where would cold just turn and step in Windows 7. Productivity takes a hit. This is why the businesses aren't adopting it, and that's why Windows 8 is failing.

It works well enough on tablets and HTPC's (IMHO), but I had to dock it an extra star because I've had nothing but bad luck with it. My HTPC was running Windows 7 Pro, so I opted to use the upgrade there. I had to basically erase everything and start fresh with the upgrade, but that's frankly how I prefer to do it anyways. The upgrade process went smoothly and was less time-consuming than I would have guessed. All but one driver was installed, and the OS was running well. I started to install my apps and standard desktop programs without a hitch. So far so good. The next day, I fired it up to continue downloading some things and play a game on Steam only to have the system bluescreen on me. That isn't that big a deal, in and of itself (not my first rodeo with Windows OS'es...bluescreens are almost a certainty at some point), but the options available to deal with it are vague at best (guessing the ""Refresh"" is akin to the Repair Install in Windows XP, while the full Reset is a more traditional Windows reinstall since it gets rid of whatever you have on the PC). The fact that none of them worked is also disappointing.

So here I am, with a nonfunctional PC that had been fine for a couple of years using Windows 7. That in and of itself isn't a condemnation of the Windows 8 OS (again, kind of used to it by this point), but the fact that the OS itself is so NOT compelling that I'm strongly considering going back to 7 probably is. As it now stands, I can't really think of a single compelling reason to upgrade to Windows 8, especially on a traditional desktop or non-touch-enabled laptop. Windows 8 simply wasn't designed with those platforms (the vast majority of the PC market, mind you) in-mind.

UPDATE: Ultimately, the issue that I was having was due to a bad hard drive, so I can't fault Windows 8 for that. Once I received the replacement from Western Digital, I reinstalled Windows 8, and this time all went well. Well, that's not entirely correct...everything went well until activation. It wouldn't work...at all. I searched and saw that this has been an ongoing issue since Windows 8 was in public beta, and it still has not been resolved. Luckily for me, the (overly) tedious phone activation did work, but that shouldn't be necessary. And yes, my wireless network adaptor and router are working properly (it also wouldn't activate over a wired connection).

The PC worked well enough, until this morning. Steam works, Diablo III installed without a hitch, all of my standard apps. As far as compatibility goes, it's been great. I turn on the PC today, only to see that it needs to restart due to updates. Ok...that's typical Microsoft there, so I restart. Nothing. The system posts, Windows 8 begins to boot and then goes to a black screen...that's it. Apparently this is another ongoing issue, and after pressing F8 to go into the repair process, Windows tells me that my system is unable to boot properly (thanks for the tip...). It tells me that it's going to do a restore, and it does. My system starts. That's all fine and good, but I'm growing a bit weary of hoop-jumping. It's obvious to me that Windows 8 isn't ready for prime-time. It's got all of the typical bugs that typify a Microsoft OS. Once those are out of the way and once Microsoft repairs the neutered desktop, Windows 8 might be something to consider, but as things are, you'd do better to wait. Unless you really, REALLY like the Modern (Metro UI) and/or half-baked apps, there's no real reason to upgrade to Windows 8.

UPDATE: I'm done Microsoft. The PC had been running normally until this morning. Upon booting, I notice that I have no connectivity, so I go to troubleshoot my wireless connection. Windows crashes...hard. The PC restarts, and I can tell something is wrong, because it's taking forever. Long story short (and three hours worth of repair attempts later), and I've made my decision to go back to Windows 7. The repairs don't work, the new ""frowny"" BSoD's give precious little information (no error codes, just Microsoft's condolences and a vague error message telling me that my system configuration information was bad...yay). I just want a computer that works, and the only thing I use this PC for is gaming and the occasional movie (have it in the living room). So far, Windows 8 has been a nightmare. Maybe I'll give it another chance once Blue/8.1 hits, but until then, I'm reverting to Windows 7 for my sanity's sake.

Word is effectively the standard format for documents in the American business world, and most of my employers use Exchange as their email server. Therefore, what I most want from my office suite is something that 1. works well reading and writing Word documents and 2. provides a way to connect to my employer's Exchange server and properly handle its calendars, meeting requests, etc.

Office 2008 for Mac just does that! I pulled up and edited my old PC Office-created Word resume with no problem, and haven't experienced major issues reading any other Word document yet. The Exchange capabilities of Entourage work like a charm, let you accept and send meeting requests and generally enable you do all of the things you're used to doing with Outlook, but can't currently do with Mac Mail. The simple Excel spreadsheets I used for timesheets pulled up in Mac Excel without a hitch and Messenger and Powerpoint are nice-to-haves.

For better or worse (I say better), the interface for Office 2008 for Mac isn't the ribbon interface you may be used to with Office 2007 for PC, but after getting used to the Mac's Office interface, I actually found it easier to use!

I miss having applications like OneNote (though Word has a similar ""Notebook"" mode), InfoPath and Visio, the forthcoming version of Mac Mail diminishes Entourage's value by providing Exchange support and power-users of Office may miss features like the ability to hack together VBA macros (the Mac Workflows are a bit more limited), but for most business users, Office 2008 for Mac will suit their needs perfectly and provide the necessary hook into the Microsoft Office suite that currently dominates the business landscape.

Overall, I'd recommend the package and think it's an essential purchase for most business users especially since SP2 added Live Workspace and SharePoint integration.

One of our kids needed to do rough edits for a group project that had been filmed using a Sony that recorded onto optical disks, and when the group members could not get the proprietary editor to work, they asked me for help. That experience ended in a quick purchase of iLife and the short-term disappearance of my laptop.

For the past several years, I have needed to capture video and create digital ""movies"" ranging from 15 to 70 minutes in duration, complete with titles, themes, edits, wipes, and textual overlays. I tend to have to generate these in pressure-cooker clusters, with very little time between taping and final output. Because my primary equipment is Mac, I have become familiar with generating these ""movies"" using iMovie and then reducing the size of the resulting files with Handbrake. At the time I began testing Corel VideoStudio, I was running iMovie '08 and was wishing for a more powerful video editor. Based on Corel's literature, I anticipated the tools and effects to be more robust and diverse than iMovie. In addition, I dislike surrendering my computer while iMovie processes my edited files, which can take over an hour per file for larger files; using the family desktop would be a way to free my laptop of file-processing or a way to run two different edits at a time.

Other reviewers have noted the consumption of time and drive space required at setup; these were something I budgeted for and thus not a hindrance to my use or impression of the program. What I did find to be a drawback was the lack of intuitiveness/obviousness of the editing process, even after practice and acclimatization. For context, I calibrated my expectation of the process to be similar between this product and what it was like to learn Photoshop in the pre-Elements era.

With practice, I was able to generate output that met my needs and that was richer in nature than my iMovie files. However, the interface was not as intuitive as I needed it to be, which makes using Corel VideoStudio a bit of a slog. And on each occasion when I have returned to it after an absence of several weeks, several of the steps just did not come naturally to me, which I consider to be a negative.",Doesn't Achieve Full Potential,1342569600,,

The program runs okay, but seems a tad on the sluggish side, even on an i7 processor  with hyper-threading and 6 gig of ram.

This seems to be Cyberlink's answer to Adobe Lightroom, which I use extensively for all my NEF (RAW) photo processing, cataloging, and publishing. In that respect, I admit a fair amount of bias towards Lightroom as it is what I'm well versed in using and used to using on a daily basis. For someone who has never used Lightroom, Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra is a viable alternative that is well worth consideration. It is very easy to use and you can get very similar end results using either one.

The only issues with Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra I've run across is how it specifically handles NEF files from my D300 and D610. There is slightly more noticeable color banding than what Lightroom gives, and significantly more than what Nikon's own Capture NX-D software gives. I would also give the Nikon Capture NX-D software the edge in noise reduction.

Here's the thing though, this is a 3rd party software no matter what brand camera you use. In the case of Nikon DSLR's, any of the advanced in-camera settings you use such as Active D-Lighting, lens correction profiles, long-exposure noise reduction and so-forth are completely ignored by anything but Nikon's own proprietary software. You can emulate some of those things in post-processing, but not all of them.

Recording is where you save the results of your research and report them to your future generations.

Most important to me is improved performance and stability with brushes up to three times faster, not to mention tons of new brushes.  You can also now rotate paper texture and flow maps.  There is a dedicated icon for default settings restoration where you can preserve custom brushes, palettes and paper textures. You can switch between default, single document and presentation views from three different areas (toolbox, window menu, keyboard shortcuts).

Also new is Audio Expression, brushes that react to sound, using audio from streaming music or your computer's microphone which you can sync to brush controls like brush size, angle, color.  Also very helpful are visual tool tips with illustrations which show how your attempted adjustments will affect the custom brushes applied to your creation. You can now personalize your workspace by modifying the UI color scheme.

This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade.  It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches.  For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet!  I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.

Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make.  While the look and feel of Windows 8 is strikingly different, for the most part it boils down to one huge change:  the Start Menu that we have had since Windows 95 is no longer a menu.  Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths in a full-screen splash.  Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7:  rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for.  If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces.  This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

UPDATE: Amazon customer Robert Haines says that there is a program called ""Classic UI"" that would restore the old look, so if you're dead-set on new code that skips the new UI, you might want to try that.  There is also a program called ""Pokki Menu"" that will let you make your own customizations and last, Stardock makes a (paid) program called ""Start8"" that will also roll back the Start screen.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different.  Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product.  Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet:  you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy.  Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7.  Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8.  Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop).  Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar.  The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything.  My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.

For some features, time will tell.  I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time.  I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications.  The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to.  I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score).  The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel:  expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen.  If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS:  so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.

Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.

UPDATE, 11/2013:  Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, an update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better.  If you purchase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost.  The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8.  Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences.  I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason.  Sooo....if you go the Windows 8.1 route, there is then a Windows 8.1 ""Update for Windows 8.1"" that you should probably pull down that puts one more round of fixes into the OS.  Reviews so far have been positive--minor adjustments like putting the power button where it's easy to find and making interacting with the Tile UI have been needed...but surprisingly it also lowered the OS' system requirements to where it can run on as little as 1GB of RAM.",Will the GUI Stick With You?,1351209600,579,

In theory at least.

Installation completed without a hitch, and upon launching the program, it looked as though the software was going to perform as advertized. Except that every single time I started a DVD burning project it would hang. It didn't matter what media I used (I tried several different disk) or what I was burning (I tried doing just one 2 minute file to see if that would complete) the burn would fail midway through.

I can burn DVDs through Apple's native software, including picture slideshows, DVD movies, and DATA cds. I can do none of the above with this program.

Read all of the reviews of those with similar issues, and ask yourself if its worth plunking down the money on a product that MIGHT work. Will you be one of the lucky ones? Also ask yourself if you want to do business with a company that is intentionally opaque about whether Toast 11 supports burning HD content to standard DVDs--if you want that feature be prepared to pay even more for something you thought you were getting all along. I give my money willingly to companies that provide a good product at a reasonable price, advertized correctly and detailing what the program will and won't do. ROXIO doesn't fall into that category. Thankfully I received my copy for free from the Vine program, so financially I have lost nothing but my time.

I remember reading about it in either Compute! or Ahoy! magazine.  Back then, the Dvorak keyboard layout was a popular alternative but I got the product back then to improve my typing skills.  It did work back then...so when I saw this product I thought I would continue the tradition of improving typing with my own family.

First, Mavis beacon is not a real person - it is a fictitious character designed to inject some life into a typing program.

The latest version of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing touts the use of a new technology called UltraKey.  UltraKey is actually a standalone typing tutor / engine you can purchase...so it appears that Mavis Beacon has partnered with the makers of UltraKey to enhance their product line.

What you get with this product is 330 typing exercises with 12 interface themes.  This is basic instructional typing software that teaches the fundamentals of the keyboard.  You progress in a systematic manner from basic instruction to words, sentences, then paragraphs.  You can see virtual hands which mimic motions on a virtual keyboard.  Stopping to correct mistakes deducts from your typing speed rather than some typing applications which make you continue on and chastise you for making mistakes.  You also get some pointers on posture which I didn't heed as I am touch typing this review while hunched over a darkened keyboard.

Product support comes in the form of an online user's guide, ability to email for help and some videos and FAQs.

Unfortunately, this product is licensed for just one user and computer.  This is a downside to me because we have several laptops in my home which are used somewhat interchangeably.  Many software installs these days allow for more than one user / computer.

Overall - you get graphical and usability improvements galore over the old C64 version of this software which is only mentioned for amusement.  I think this product is an effective aide at improving typing efficiency and skill.  It is far better to learn properly up front versus trying to retrain yourself to type after you've already learned the wrong way.

- Editing Masks
- Graphic overlays
- Color correction & brightness
- White balance & tone adjustments (very useful for indoor photography)
- Video rotation
- Ability to add flash animations to your video
- Chroma key functions
- Surround sound mixing
- Stretching audio duration

From my tests and reading of the manual these functions seem to be relatively easy to use.  However, the quality of the program is always found in the production process and the final output.

To test VideoStudio Pro X2 I imported a 30 minute avi file and had VideoStudio segment this clip into segments.  Next, I placed these segments onto the storyboard and cut out a few unwanted clips at the start and end of video.  Next, I trimmed the opening and ending clips using the clip trim handles.  Finally, I applied an audio fade at the end of the video and burned the production to a dvd.  All of these functions worked perfectly and quickly on a Pentium 4, 3ghz machine with 3 gigabytes of ram.  Impressive!

However, VideoStudio does exhibit some unstable behavior upon exiting the program. VideoStudio has given me a couple error messages upon shutdown.  Strangely, neither of these error messages affected the editing and production process.  My guess is that VideoStudio is not fully releasing the memory it was occupying.

Corel is close to having a class defining video editor.  Hopefully, Corel will issue an update to fix some of the small but irritating bugs.

I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
  I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
  One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable.  For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available.  Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
  In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable!  You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
  The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment.  It is rarely right!  ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier!  There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons.  It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
  Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
  Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one.  In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text.  That has been omitted in 2007.  In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
  To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions.  After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats!  If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format.  The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
  Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems.  For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen.  Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed.  When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text.  When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top!  Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in!  (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation!  ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
  For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
  I have always loved Microsoft Office.  It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case.  I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.

I recently helped my brother setup Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  12 a while after he purchased it. I'll focus on the differences between the two.

With both installation on Windows 7 Pro was painless. The initial setup of 12 wanted you to do the training step which involves reading several pages from a publication. These are internal to the Dragon setup with several good selections. With 13 much of this is optional, but still improves accuracy and helps Dragon learn you writing style.

Dragon profile setup may be tedious, but I think it's worth it for the improved results.

In Dragon 13 literature there are 14 new or improved features:
1) 15% greater accuracy: I'm not sure how such a definitive number, but I believe it's improved.

2) Learning from sent email works with web clients now:
  I don't use the supported web mail clients - I'm an Outlook gal.

3) There is a new Dragon Vocabulary editor:
  I have not tried this yet. I'll share my experience when I update this again later.

4) Smart Format Rules Enhancement:
  I think 13 is learning my common usage and adapting. This is kind of subtle and I can't really tell yet if it's better than 12.

5) Faster Than Ever:
  13 does seem a little faster to me but it's hard to tell on different machines with different characteristics. My brother's PC with 12 is an older core duo and has 6GB. Mine is a newer core i7 with 16GB. It seems fast enough to me. 13 is supposed to evaluate the resources of a system and adapt Dragon to make the best use of even limited resources.

Easier setup is via several changes in requirements and the audio setup. All to remove or make optional steps that were included in the Dragon 12 setup. This makes it faster to get started but all three of these improve quality.

6) With 13 Dragon assigns a name to profiles:
  To name a profile you need to rename it later. In 12 you were asked for the name when creating the profile.

7) The somewhat tedious reading for 4 minutes isn't required any more:
  It does improve accuracy. My vision impaired brother struggled with reading the selection from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it took us nearly an hour to get through it. When we were done Dragon did very well with his distinct ""Down East"" Maine accent. While it's not required in 13 I think it made a noticeable improvement.

8) Dragon 13 no longer asks to adapt its vocabulary with documents/email at profile creation:
  This saves time but, again it is a step that benefits overall use at a less convenient startup. Document/email analysis can be done later.

9) Dragon 13 audio setup lets you just pick your input device:
  I used the headset that came with Dragon Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  which works very well. 13 also works pretty well with my laptop's built-in noise cancelling microphone which 12 didn't support. I don't even recall the microphone setup steps on 12 so I think they must have been almost as easy. I'm happy to see support for the open source OpenOffice Writer V4.1.

10) The microphone check step is a short reading:
  Again I don't recall this step on 12 though I'm sure it was there too.

11) Dragon 13 has increased its support of web based applications:
  Support has been added for web applications like Gmail and added commands and support for all major browsers. I have not explored this too much yet. I'll update this review when I've learned more. Dragon is very impressive to me in the amount of voice control it readily provides.

12) The DragonBar has been redesigned in 13:
  If you have 12 and want to go back to the ""classic"" bar it's in there and supported. I like the way it autocollapses so it does not use more screen space than needed.

13) The Dragon Sidebar is now the Learning Center:
  Whatever they call it I like having it around as I am continuing to learn Dragon. They way it adapts to the context of the currently open application is clever and very helpful.

14) The interactive tutorial has been expanded:
  It now covers the Dragon bar, learning center and the Vocabulary Editor. I think the tutorials are pretty good, but I just jumped in head first. In 12 my brother tried the tutorial simulation. It was well intentioned but the tutorial didn't understand his accent. Seems the tutorials do not use the just created profile. They are there for those who want/need them and that's a very good thing.

So far I'm liking Dragon 13 with the included headset. It's a complex program with many aspects I hope to try and dig into as I find time to get beyond my present basic use. These include using the dictation transcription capability which I hope to use with the iPhone app.

Dragon isn't perfect - sometimes it can seem to get confused when I stumble over some words, and this can result in dictated text that is hilarious! When this happens and I try to continue while laughing the results can get even more funny to the point where I have to stop and walk away and regain my composure before continuing. Somehow I've come to really like those fairly rare times takes me into a laughing fit. I can't think of another program where I look forward to it going off the rails like this.

It seems to me that 13 appears more an incremental improvement over 12 than a revolutionary upgrade. If I had 12 instead of my brother I would probably just kept it. If you need the expanded applications control or need more flexible microphone capability then 13 may be a good move even from 12.

It has had a good run.  It still offers something to those who want to plan long road-trips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems.  The mapping system does what it says it does, so that's fine....

What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works.  Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky -- well, no, and unless you're driving in a convertible....

Finally, as a passenger in a mini-van, I was able to obtain ""constant-intermittent"" service.  ""Huh?"" you might well ask.  Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice (even my old GPS has 6 smooth voice-choices for English) that it was re-routing and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is.  That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles.

I tried the male-to-famale USB cord they included to enhance the signal.  It's 28"" long (not including the connectors).  This is just long enough to be too long to rest the receiver on your lap(top) and too short to tape it to the windshield or a window, which might actually be useful.  Another loser component.

There's no traffic notification system designed into this system, which is something even my 2-year-old Garmin has.  That feature saves me a LOT of time sitting in traffic, and I can't see going backwards to this MS offering.

Also, you can't just type in a destination while driving.  You have to set up a complete ""trip"" before-hand.  This is just silly.  What you must do is create and plan a ""trip"" to your destination from some place you recently passed, while driving (disclaimer....), from whence it will re-route your ""trip,"" just to make the unit function using the same approach it did years ago before the GPS component was introduced.

This would be the negative to this software for the novice to intermediate user.  A tough learning curve that requires weeks, if not months of learning before you feel comfortable using it.  Some would argue that this is the case with most high-end software whether it relates to animation or not.  I would tend to agree, but it can be a con for some.

The positives to this software are many.  It can be used by PC or MAC users, offers the ability to bring your drawings to life, automatically lip-syncs your audio to the drawings, and allows you to import Photoshop files.

The software is feature-rich with tweaks to color schemes, brush sizes, and layers (similar to Photoshop) which was expected.  What wasn't expected was the ability to do 3D renderings to share on YouTube.  Pretty cool stuff!  The ability to upload your creations to Facebook and YouTube is a fun perk.

Advanced users will love the ability to script their own tools and add-ons for the program, but frankly, this user will never get to that point!

All the major video formats are supported, with output up to 1080p and even in 3D.

Made for professional digital artists and animation professionals, Anime Studio 8 is loaded with amazing features and delivers what it promises on that front.

If you do not fall into that category of user, you may find it overwhelmingly hard to learn anything but the basics through the wizard.  You can learn more than that on your own, but it takes time in the form of a lot of reading and hands-on trial and error.

It is Vista home premium with SP1. I rather like it. I have read numerous reviews that don't like it so much, so I am giving my experience here for those, like me, are considering a new computer with pre-installed Vista. My question was: How is Vista better than XP?

Answer: It looks better!

I am not joking. The only attraction is the aero effect thing where a little bit of each window is slightly transparent, the windows also pop up with a magical effect, like a balloon. It disappears the same way too, with some transparency worked in. It has an option of extra large icon that's really big if you want it, though that takes up screen space fast. The files are also a little bit open you so you can see a file or two in there, but in XP you can see stuff inside too, as many as four things, so the open trick isn't much of an improvement. Also, you can get these things called ""Vista Gadgets"" for the desktop, like a little calender or a battery charge indicator or even a quick search to amazon that just sits there as part of the desktop. Other program covers it, but otherwise it runs on its own without bothering anything.

(And why do I want a quick search to amazon, you might ask, if I already have it bookmarked as a favorite page? Well you see, you still have to click to open a webpage first before you can click your favorite. With the amazon gadget, you just type directly into it what you want, and a webpage will pop up without you having to click to open it! Really saves on the finger energy, you know?)

Other than this, there is nothing to Vista whatsoever that is different from XP. There is heightened security measures in the form of ""OS fearfulness"", but I always disable those things as much as possible because they are nothing but a nuisance. Whenever you want to do something it asks, ""Are you sure?"" It can't tell if something is wrong, mind you. It just keep asking YOU, and you have to keep assuring it like it is a scared child. And I can't disable all of it because then it nags constantly, ""Security setting is set too low! Please raise it!""

There are a few minor inconveniences. First, the standard picture viewer will not display GIF images, unlike the one in XP. The help part explicitely states that the viewer will ONLY display bmp and jpg format pictures. Also, the Windows Mail, the equivalent of Outlook Express, no longer has the contact pane where you can just double click any contacts and opening a black email to write. You have to open the contact file each time.

Also, the included Internet Explorer has a ton of problems. It freezes every time I go to my hotmail account. I know, they are both Microsoft, so why can't they get along? Who knows. It freezes on certain other sites too, for no particular reason. I don't have any trouble with the old IE in XP, but Vista does not allow you to downgrade. (My Netscape in Vista manages hotmail and other pages just fine, so that's what I use.)

A friend warned that my old programs might not install in Vista. I've installed a few now. So far, everything works.

So here is the conclusion: except for the pretty translucent aero effect, Vista is identical to XP in every way if you don't think about the few bugs. So if you are into pretty (like me), do get it. It looks cool! It's fun watching the windows pop open and then vanish when you close it! But if you think that sounds stupid, then there is no question XP with SP2 is better in the sense that it is more stable and have fewer bugs.

I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed that the aero thing is all that I am getting out of a brand new operating system. Considering how long it took Microsoft to work on Vista, I thought it'd be a lot more exciting. Maybe they have been concentrating on programming ""Are you sure"" into every move anybody makes. Back when I upgraded from Windows 95 to XP, there were a so many fun new impressive things to enjoy. So the next time another new Windows come out, I won't bother with it.","It's prettier than XP, but otherwise the same thing with a few more bugs",1211414400,37,

Peterson,"Having been a satisfied user of PaperPort 9 for many years, and after hearing continued horror stories about every subsequent release, it was with great trepidation that I finally decided to upgrade to a newer version.  The upgrade to PP Pro 14.0 went smoothly, and I have used the product daily since then, and despite some quirks and bugs, I am happy that I finally upgraded.

I have used PaperPort 9 extensively since it came out years ago for scanning and organizing virtually all paperwork that comes through my home and office, and it has long been one of the ""must-have"" applications that I use every day.  When I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Pro 64 bit, I was dismayed to discover that PP 9 would not run on Windows 7 (nor would my Canon scanner), so I installed VirtualBox and used it to host a virtual Windows XP machine in which I could continue running both PP 9 and my scanner, which actually has worked pretty well.  (I tried the ""XP mode"" in Win 7 but it did not have good USB support that I needed for the scanner.) But PP 9 and my old scanner were aging and becoming more difficult to use for reasons described below, so it was time for an upgrade.

So I finally decided to take a chance and modernize with PP 14 and a new scanner.  Mindful of all the problems some people have reported, before doing the upgrade I took precautions.  To make sure that I could roll everything back if PP 14 messed up my system, I forced an immediate full backup to my Windows Home Server (I HIGHLY recommend anyone who uses Windows to get one of these), and then also set a system restore point in Windows 7 (via Control Panel/System).  This turned out to be unnecessary insurance because the upgrade completed without any problems.

The biggest problem I have had with PP 14 has been just figuring out all of the changes since version 9, which are extensive (and most of which I don't need), and also figuring out how to mate it up with the software for the new Canon scanner that I got to work with it.  Both PP and the scanner have a lot of options - everything seems to get more complicated, not less - and it took me a while to discover the best set of options for each.

Good things:
- The user interface is much more modern looking, and is visually similar to the Microsoft Office 2007 ribbon bar - love it or hate it.
- It is noticeably faster than PP 9, especially when it comes to displaying document thumbnails.  My collection of scanned items is very large, so PP 9 was taking a long time to display any new folder full of documents.  PP 14 is much faster, which alone almost makes the upgrade worthwhile for me.
- It creates and views PDF version 1.7 (the latest version), while PP 9 would only create and view PDF 1.4 (the version used by Acrobat 5).  That limitation in PP 9 was also another major motivator for my upgrade.
- It, together with my new scanner, produces better images, faster than before, and also automatically applies some fixes such as auto-straighten which works very well.
- And it runs natively under Windows 7, allowing me to get rid of the need to start a virtual machine in which to run Windows XP - this was taking a lot of memory, as well as extra time.

Not-so-good things:
- The user interface and workflow are more complicated than PP 9.  I don't need a lot of that stuff, which adds clutter and complexity.
- I have experienced several non-critical (but nevertheless annoying) program crashes.
- It apparently just won't work with the TWAIN driver for my scanner - only the WIA driver.  Neither PP nor my scanner was able to shed any light on this - I just had to muddle through by experimentation.
- After installing PP 14, which comes with a bunch of auxiliary applications such as ""PDF Viewer Plus"" (which is made by DocuCom), I was unable to display most PDF files from Google Chrome - downloading important things like financial statements would result in an error box titled ""PDF Viewer Plus 7.1 - A file error has occurred.""  This was a serious problem for me, but I was finally able to solve it by a non-obvious Chrome fix:  Type ""chrome://plugins"" in the Chrome input line to bring up a list of plugins, find ""DocuCom PDF Plus"" and disable it.

This is something you would see with Win 3.1 where MS is just throwing in whatever to make it look interesting and appealing to people yet at the same time you are frustrated because there is just no easy access to everything. Most things are hidden or invisible and if you can figure out how to shut down the system without giving up and hitting the power button on your PC then maybe perhaps this OS was right for you. However Windows should be easy to use, this isn't.

Another problem i have with this OS is the control panel options and all those little awesome library icons that is right there on your fingertips when you want to watch a movie, access a document or games if you are a gamer. However, instead of allowing people to get used to the new system by leaving the classic start menu & all it's wonderful actions for a less, technical way of moving around in your system. You can tell this was designed for simple users who don't require all that extra fluff and your stuck with a cheap style that doesn't want you to customize your PC the way you want it to be.

The desktop itself looks plain, looks like a modern version of Win 95 with plain tiling and expecting you to figure out how to customize it to look more appealing. No Aero theme which was innovative in itself. Under the hood for specs and Win 8 is a little less on processes giving you more power to use elsewhere and a nice task manager. Here i give a little breakdown on the pros and cons & see for yourself.

Pros:

It's new.
Windows Task Manager has more to it with more functionality.
It's easy on the processes (but doesn't necessarily make your system faster)

Cons:
No start menu making the OS more difficult to use.
Replaced start menu with an entire screen forcing you to leave your immediate screen.
Many things are invisible and for a new user of Win 8 will be lost & leaving you more frustrated then excited about a new OS.
No Aero theme, desktop is plain.
Charging users to get the legacy start menu back.

So there you have it while i could have given this a better rating, i just hated this OS & wouldn't recommend it to anyone. MS listened to it's users with Win 7, it's easy to use and i will continue to use this OS & will not bother to upgrade to this system or the next one if MS will not listen to it's feedback, put features in that a good portion of users are not familiar with. With each new OS it takes me 5 minutes to learn each one. With this one, it was just unnerving, awkward & it's a mess. After trying this out i won't even buy a tablet. iPod's interface blows Win 8 away. Had MS kept the original start menu & did something different with the new look i might have given this a better review. However Win 8 is unfinished, poorly executed & overall i am unable to see how anyone could enjoy using this system. As a tech point of view, it's frustrating not having control over an OS & it is NOT easy to use. The easiest and fastest way through the system is the start menu. It was replaced by an inferior, non-sufficient UI system. Sticking with Win 7 for as long as i can. After 2020, i hope that either there are some better OS's in the future, otherwise i would pay MS $50 a year to keep Win 7 in operation.",Microsoft didn't listen to consumer input with this one...,1351296000,20,

I'm running the software on a machine I built that has an AMD FX-8320 processor.  That's an eight-core processor with 64-bit capability that runs at 3.5 ghz.  I've got it paired with 8gb of low latency Crucial memory.  The program resides on an SSD.

X7 launches almost instantly, and even with large files, it runs smooth as silk on this setup.

Corel actively supports this software.  On June 16, Corel released the X7.1 update, which is downloadable from their website for free.  (You have to have started at least a standard Corel account.  X7 requires that you start at least a free standard account in order to use templates and receive certain other benefits.  You can upgrade to a premium account, but that costs extra.)  I'm still toying around with this new X7.1 update.  In addition to general stability fixes, the main features it adds are the ability to customize elements of user interface (e.g., colors of borders and dialog boxes, location of status bar) and enhancements for the Object Model that make it more powerful.

Workflow in the product is good and intuitive.  Others have addressed that thoroughly and I don't have much to add there.

You get a large number of high quality fonts with X7, almost all from the Bitstream type foundry, which has been around for decades producing excellent fonts.  If you were to buy the fonts separately, the cost would easily surpass the entire price of this package.

Overall, I have found this to be a great upgrade.  The 64-bit core allows the program and computer to exploit full memory resources and gives a great boost to stability and speed in my experience.

This is a powerful tool for graphic design and isn't too daunting to learn to use.  Highly recommended.","64-bit power, stability, and speed -- now with 7.1 update and additional fixes and features",1403136000,2,

I gave one of my older computers to a neighbor kid and used Drive Scrubber to remove everything from the hard drive.  I then used the software that came with the old computer to restore it to a like new condition.  I don't actually know if criminal investigators, or information hackers, can restore any of the erased data or not.  But for me, at least in this instance, it doesn't matter.

But understand, I cannot prove that the program actually works.  For sure, its not perfect.  For one thing, when I analyze a disk before erasing deleted data, its result is over-printed on the text and cannot be read.  This is clearly a glitch in the program.  It existed in the first copy I installed, and it exists in the new copy I installed after removing the first - even after downloading the newest version.  This glitch of course, could be caused by my own computer or other software corrupting the program.  I just don't have the computer knowledge to know one way or the other.

I am puzzled because Corel has most of the facilities to produce a user friendly photo editing program at low cost.
After all, they have all of the routines coded already. In addition, since they bought out Ulead, they now have two different approaches to photo editing.

While I realize that they were targeting the casual photographer, that can be done with existing routines from their other products. I use Automatic Photo Correction all of the time from their Ulead Photoimpact product that does cost three times as much as this one does but it has so many more capabilities that cause it to cost that much more. But its basic functions could have been put into this product and been even easier to use than this one is with more capabilities and still meet their cost goals.

Their automatic photo correction isn't much better than Windows Picture Gallery and that is a free component of Windows.
The only major capabilities missing from Picture Gallery are the ability to change the picture size and to rotate the picture.
But those features are already functional in Photoimpact as well as several other Corel products.

The overall feeling I got using this product is the same I got using ACDSEE's editor only clumsier. The suggested retail price of ACDSEE is the same as for Photo Express but ACDSEE has so many more features they are not in the same league. Yet their target customer is the same as Corel's is, the casual photographer maintaining their home scrapbooks.

I had high hopes that it would be the ""one stop shop"" for my CD/DVD creation, photo editing, video editing, and music editing needs. However, my experience with this suite is nothing short of disappointing.

The only software I find useful in this suite is its CD/DVD creation tools -- but I already have Cyberlink Power2Go, which is much more intuitive to use. Plus Cyberlink supports Blu-ray copying; Roxio doesn't. The rest of the tools in this suite is really nothing to shout about. I'll provide a brief evaluation of each of the tools:

(1) Creating/Copying CDs/DVDs
Roxio began as a company that specialized in software for creating CDs and DVDs over a decade ago. I've used many versions of Roxio's optical disk burning software over the years and they've always worked reliably, so I expected the CD/DVD burning software in this suite to work flawlessly -- and It does. It even copies your files to a Blu-ray disk (you would need to have a Blu-ray burner of course). My only gripe is that Blu-ray copying is NOT supported. Roxio does offer support for Blu-ray video creation BUT you would have to BUY an additional PLUGIN to enable this feature. Come on Roxio. Really?? For the price, this software should have included full support for Blu-ray disks.

The plugin can be purchased from the Roxio Website. Just do a Web search for Roxio Creator NXT 4 Blu-ray plugin and the link to purchase it should come right up.

(2) Editing Photos
I'm a heavy Photoshop and Lightroom user. But there are times I want a quick and easy way to edit my photos without having to go through the fuss of opening up a resource-intensive photo editing program like Photoshop or Lightroom. I had hoped Roxio's Photo Editor would fill this void. But it doesn't unfortunately. Roxio's Photo Editor only provides very basic tools like saturation adjustment, crop, rotate, flip, straighten, sharpness adjustment, exposure adjustment, red-eye reduction, and brightness and contrast adjustments. I have freeware programs (spyware-free I should add) like Faststone and Pixlr (Web-based) that provide these tools and MORE, like healing brush, levels and curves adjustments, and various filters. Roxio does provide ""advanced tools"" like wrinkle, dust, and scratch removal -- all of which do not work very well in practice. Roxio also has layer masks BUT you're limited to PREDEFINED shapes like circle, triangle, rectangle, etc., which makes it practically useless.

(3) Editing Video
The video editor is pretty basic. The timeline interface is okay -- nothing remarkable.  I did not like any of the transitions and overlays it comes with. I could not find a way to strip the sound from a clip. It has a Web video capture feature that's supposed to capture ANY video from your browser (YouTube for example) and save it to your disk. But this feature does not work. I followed the instructions to the tee but it simply doesn't do what it promises. I did a Web search to see if I had missed something and found that the consensus among longtime Roxio Creator NXT users seems to be that this feature has been broken since Roxio Creator NXT version 2.

A feature that I DID get to work is screen recording, which records the activity on your computer screen and creates a video of it. The playback is very smooth but there is definitely a slight degradation in the audio quality.

(4) Editing Sound
Again, I'm not impressed. I much prefer to use the open source software Audacity. Roxio does have one audio capture feature that I was hopeful about but that turned out to be disappointing as well. The audio capture allows you to capture sound/music from any source (YouTube or Pandora for example) and save it to your disk (as a Wav, MP3, or Ogg file for example). However, the captured audio has a VERY noticeably lower fidelity than the source. The quality of the captured audio is poor regardless of the format (e.g wav, 192kbps MP3, Ogg, etc). I have ReplayMusic (paid) for capturing sound and this one faithfully captures the source with no perceivable degradation in audio quality.

One year (2003, as I recall) I had a serious problem and the program cost me a great deal more in taxes than I ought to have paid. It missed many new regulations, and the calculations were all off.

This year, I upgraded to Home & Business, whereas previously I used Turbo Tax Deluxe, Federal and State. The program is an enormous memory hog, and since I've been stuck on a semi-functional laptop for about seven weeks now, that is a big problem. Very often, the program takes several tries to start at all. Several times, it has frozen the machine all together, requiring that I use the power switch to reboot and try again. And generally, the program won't run at all unless I exit all the unnecessary ancillary items before opening TurboTax (Windows Messenger, my printing software, and so on).

It's hard to tell how accurate the calculation is; a huge number of rules and regulations changed this year, making the entry process far more complex and time consuming than it has ever been before. That's not the fault of Turbo Tax, but I am not entirely convinced they covered all the bases, so I've spent extra time reading IRS files just to be certain that I don't miss anything.

Like at least one other reviewer here, I too file my state taxes on paper to avoid the extra filing fees. And I too save my work after pretty much every entry. I also use a remote hard drive to back up the file --- just in case.

One year, I lost all the data after e-filing, simply because I mistakenly saved an empty tax form over the completed TurboTax file. And while I had saved a pdf file of our taxes, it has been a consistent aggravation that one cannot import data into TurboTax from a prior-year *.pdf form. Once you over-write that *.tax file, it's gone. The only way to avoid that difficulty, apparently, is to fill out the entire tax program --- and file it --- online at the Turbo Tax website.

Given the number of hacking issues at major corporations in the last few years, however, there's no way I'd trust my tax data to Turbo Tax, long term. The do-it-yourself version, on a home computer with an excellent firewall and security program is a much safer bet.

I've never used an accountant for our taxes; before tax programs were available, I struggled with the paper forms and the ""move this line to form XXXX, line 9999"" issues on my own. It was a complete nightmare even when our taxes were pretty simple, and I was delighted when computers made the annual process more manageable. I have always figured that hiring a CPA would require me in effect to do our taxes twice --- collect all the documents and then walk the accountant through them all. Not to mention costing exponentially more than Turbo Tax in fees.

Regarding one complaint, no, this year's program has NOT incorrectly required one to indicate a ""stock sale"" to report options trading. Under investment sales, one must enter ""other,"" and on the next screen, enter ""option."" Incorrectly entering an option trade as a stock sale will definitely and unnecessarily raise one's taxes on any options that expired ""worthless,"" as the IRS treats those differently than stock sales.

Admittedly, I found this aspect of the program confusing. I could not figure out why certain entry forms were missing until I called Turbo Tax support and sat on hold for an hour before obtaining a supervisor to explain it all. However, once reached, the tech walked me through the entire form, and explained the IRS code. It checked out at the federal agency website, and my hour-long hold time paid off.

To be sure, Turbo Tax is not fail safe. But with all the changes in the tax code this year, probably nothing is.

And if you think this year is bad, wait until 2013, when the bevy of new ObamaCare tax levies kick in. Then, Turbo Tax users will undoubtedly need three gigabytes of memory to keep the program running --- even after all other non-essential programs have been shut down.

The installation program asked if I wanted to ALSO install Simpliclean (a register booster and register cleaning tool)  I said NO.  I have other tools already that I know and trust; Simpliclean is one I have not used before, and it felt like bloatware.

During installation  messages talked about some of the features that I might want to be aware of, including --
 Stabilization
 Object Tracking (of objects on in the scenes)
 Mobile Video Editing for (or on?) Android
 A sound archive for slideshows and videos  Sound editing
 Showfy for sharing (hmm, Id rather use YouTube or Facebook directly)
 The latest offers, always up to date (hmm, it better not try and sell me something every time I turn around, like Pinnacle products do!)
 It made me close MS Outlook for the installation to work (it actually stopped during the installation and complained that Outlook was running, and asked me to close it thats a first! - Im not sure what it would be messing with that Outlook would also be using)

The online registration was easy  using the supplied very long key code, I did have to give it my name, email etc., to create an account with them, but thats no big deal to me.

I then ran the program, and found their _Demo project and clicked on it, (just a hunch that was the right file) and wow, it loaded up the timeline with the tracks and fades and transitions, picture in picture, show-speed, fast-speed, etc., all very nice.  I played the demo project on and watched the timeline, to see how this thing works.

* NOTE, I usually use Cyberlinks video editing products for most of my projects, but I also have Pinnacles products, and Adobe CS6 and Sony products too, along with ProShow Producer, so Im familiar with how video editing companies think, and thus how they build their editing tools, so with a little trial and error, I was able to navigate around Magix without any trouble.

I will say that on my PC, the live playback within the editing tool window was very good, better than Cyberlinks (once Cyberlink creates the shadow files, then things get better for real time editing and real time play back on the screen while you are editing, but its still not as good as I was seeing here with the Magix product!)  That was cool!

I do feel that the world probably has enough video editing tools, so seeing this one made me think, oh well, another mouse trap, and this one is probably better in some respects than the more popular Adobe and more established products such as those from Cyberlink or Pinnacle or Sony, but competition is good, and this will force the others to get better too.  Yes, there are YouTube videos for help (no printed manual comes with this product, but then no one reads those anyways).  However, theres a lot more on YouTube by professional and amateur people on how to do things in the other more established and de facto products, so while this one is good, it might not matter the others have more info on them already.

If youve never used one of these programs before, this one is very powerful, has all the nice options, but the learning curve will be steep to master all the options.  I will keep this one, and add it to my collection.

There may even be a solution to this problem from Acronis but I may never know. Support is next to nonexistant.

They do send back a nice cheery ""Have a good day!"" though.

It is a very good, inexpensive, dependable backup software application.  It has good flexibility and is user friendly (for a backup program).  It allows you to back up an entire hard drive or just selected folders and files.  You can do full or incremental backups and you can schedule them or initiate them manually.  I have mine scheduled for a full backup once a week and a daily incremental backup, all to a removable USB hard drive.  You can tell it to break the back up into 2 GByte slices so you can keep the backup hard drive nicely decluttered by running Windows defrag program from time to time.  We have a Windows XP operating system and it works very well with that.  The program also allows you to create a disaster recovery CD and a corresponding disaster recovery backup on a hard drive.  You can set levels for compression and encryption and set password protection or not.  The more the compression and encryption, the longer the backup takes but the smaller and more secure it is (the default values are fine for me).  You can also adjust the intensity of the backup effort so it will run more slowly in the background so it won't interfere with you while you are using the computer or more quickly if you schedule the backups to be done at night (as I do).  The manufacturer was very responsive when I had some initial questions about it.  Unlike Norton Ghost, which we also have, it will not communicate on-line when you tell it not to.

To add to my initial review one year later (January 2010): in a year of ownership I have greatly benefited by learning to depend on the program's termination features. You can have it just run the backup on schedule and stop, or after the backup you can also set it to automatically perform ""power"" functions. These include shutdown, log off, Standby, and Hibernate (assuming you have configured your computer for Hibernate). What this means is that my copy of this program at work starts a backup a little after my normal office hours and shuts the computer down afterwards. So I get an incremental backup of the day's complete work without spending productive office time doing it and save energy by turning it off, too. At home I have it tuck itself into Standby after our normal bed time. So we get full use of the computer all day, a backup of the day's activities afterwards, and don't let it run up our utility bill, either. And Standby turns off the USB backup drive as well to preserve its longevity.  On the other end of the spectrum you can set it to wake up your computer from Standby to run a backup before you need to use the computer.  The settings also show up in the Scheduled Tasks for Windows XP and Windows Vista (unlike any of the Ghost products). We now have four licensed copies of Genie. It is easily a better backup tool than the others we have tried: Norton Ghost 10.0, Norton Ghost 14.0, Norton 360, DT Utilities' PC Backup Pro, or the native Windows XP and Windows Vista backup programs. Genie does what you tell it to, unlike Norton Ghost which has a fit because it missed one day's scheduled incremental backup or Windows Vista's native backup which will only restore the computer to the way it was when the backup was made and therefore requires the same size hard drives partitioned into volumes exactly the same way (sort of a joke because by the time a good hard drive wears out you find they do not make them that small anymore so you can not replace it with an identical hard drive!).","Very good, inexpensive backup software.",1233360000,4,

Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.

Okay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.

Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.

It started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose ""off"" for all of them.  That didn't seem to slow down Windows 10 at all or mess it up or whatever.  Now, when I go online, I'm online in usually 60 seconds or so.  Firefox, Chrome and Windows Edge, which replaced IE, are all working well.  I can go from one browser to another with no problems.

But everyone knows Amazon's rating system is utterly subjective -- and for me, this one failing on the part of Quicken Deluxe 2011 is extremely annoying and devastating.

I had been using Money 2006 for several years.  As everyone knows, that product line was discontinued due to lack of demand.  I decided to get Quicken Deluxe 2011, which promised Money file compatibility.  While waiting for Quicken to arrive from Amazon, I uninstalled Money 2006 to reclaim some disk space.

To my great distress, I discovered, upon launching Quicken, that Money must be present on the system for Quicken to import the Money file!  According to the dialog box, ""Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008 must be installed on your computer before we can import your Money file.""  Okay, so maybe Money 2006 wouldn't even have worked, so it probably wouldn't have made a difference in my case.  But this is just absolutely ridiculous.  My Money file has no password protection, and I just don't see why Money is required to be installed for Quicken to read the file.

So I decided to give Quicken a spin anyway to see if it was worth my time to start from scratch.  When I clicked on that big ""Get Started"" button, Quicken started downloading an updated financial institution list.  After 10 minutes, it was still doing the same (the status indicator was simply moronic and indicated little).  I stopped out of that, and clicked ""Get Started"" again, this time Quicken began downloading a program update, but then nothing happened.  At this point, I decided to write up this review.

One other thing I also noticed is, after I ran Quicken for the first time, my quad-core PC, which had always been zippy and extremely responsive in everything, has begun to show some random slowdowns, which reminded me of the days when I ran Symantec's awful Norton Anti-Virus software.  I really wonder if Intuit installed some background services that have a significantly negative impact on my otherwise optimized system (Win 7 64-bit).

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Nancy Drew is off to the City of Dreams? [Is that right?] No? Anyway, she gets to rub elbows with a Soap Opera Star in the Big Apple. Oh yeah, there is the confusion; isn't this supposed to be in Hollywood? Well, it's all about climbing the ladder of goodwill and what better way than through the entertainment industry, right?

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:
Mattie Jensen: The girl of the hour. Stick with her and you'll go far, kid. Well, all she did was sit around rehearsing lines, but that is the life of an actress. I did see her one scene she had acted which wasn't bad. No, I don't think she's the culprit. Why is she dating around so frequently like that? Ick.

Mille Strathorn: That silly old bat. Loved her riddles [half have been done before in other venues]. I think she is getting a little senile, but I don't think it was enough to be considered the culprit, especially since she owns the place.

Lillian Weiss: Man, she needs to get la.... wait, this is a family show. She was just a mean girl, but her abrasiveness was so strong that I doubted she was the culprit.

William Pappas: I only heard grumblings from his office. If he don't physically appear in the game, he ain't the culprit :P

Dwayne Powers: This guy was just falling apart! [Financially, second-guessing his relationship with Mattie, etc.]  I am glad he cast me as an extra! Yaahhh!

Rick Arlen: He was a smooth talker and a couple of his one-liners made me smile, but I had him firmly in my target sight as the evil villain.

Phone-A-Friends: This has got to be the 2nd best interplay in the relationship of Nancy/Ned aside from the Captive Curse argument. They said they loved each other! That was amazing only Adventure # 2 into the series since I don't believe I have heard it since. By game # 31, is the romance getting stale? This version of Bess had an odd accent and I believe this particular game was the most helpful George has ever been.

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 87

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The background music was a little blander than other games, but it didn't detract from the ambience. You have to forgive the cartoonish graphics from 1999.  Overall, it was fine.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 87

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: Like I mentioned before, the riddles were intriguing since it hasn't been done again in the series. There were no mini games. :(  In fact, I think HER went with plot and culprit motivations over cheaper filler material, which makes this game stand apart from the later adventures in the series. [And that got fans to trip over themselves with praise for the good old days.]

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 85

GENERAL IOTAS: A lot of little bugs involving linear plot being halted unless you were perfect with clue discovery. I think this frustrated fans and the later games featured this process less.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

ADVENTURE ENDING: It was ridiculous in the scheme of things how bland it was. I am not necessarily complaining, but compared with other endings, this was definitely bottom 3 for HER all time.

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 82

* PART 2 *
I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days [7 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 81

My Strong Points: The games I was given, I mostly aced.

My Weak Points: Swung and missed on the culprit.

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 82 + 81/2 = 81.5 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracks the Top Ten! Not bad considering the problems with computer programming in the late 90's. Just goes to show that story can outclass most visual and sound appeal. Perhaps HER can Remaster THIS. The poorly released Secrets Can Kill didn't really deserve the Remaster even though the nostalgia of the opening game was understood.

+I like the toothbrush, thinify (changes aspect ration to make your target look thinner without changing the ratio of the pic), suntan, etc

-The tools are only slightly better than what you'd find in free programs like Picasa.
-The variety of instant effects was low comparable to many full function programs.
-This isn't a replacement for Photoshop or Gimp. It doesn't allow full editing. Just photo adjustments.

* Is it easy to install?
* Is it user-friendly to get started in editing?
* How long does it take from initial setup to tutorial? To editing?

INSTALLATION: I have Windows 10, which I regard as, finally, a decent operating system after several iterations of agony. With this OS, and with High-Speed internet available, installation is reasonably fast and quite easy. Still, I would have preferred the basic program to have been on the disc, rather than being forced to download the entire program. With anything less than a high-speed connection, the time required will try one's patience. Update patches install quickly and, of course, it is good to know they are updating the software on a regular basis.

INTERFACE: The interface is intuitive similar in ease of use to that which I love with Mac and iOS. In fact, this design almost makes up for my disappointment in the lack of a backup on the disc.

All in all, I was ready to commence learning within an hour and I had already begun editing some sound files within another half hour.

Anyway, nobody showed me how to do anything related to video editing and I was really starting from square one on my own.  It took a bit of time, but simply by playing around with it a bit, I figured out how to do most things I could think to want to do.  The interface made sense and their documentation was sufficient for me to learn by playing.

Back then, Pinnacle was pretty buggy.  Several times I would want to throw something at my computer because the program would crash and lose the last hour of my work.  That was a big deal, however, everything else about Pinnacle made me very happy.  Since then, I've tried my hand at several other video editing suites including (and I don't even know if some of these are around anymore) Roxio Video Wave, Cyberlink Power Director, Corel Video studio, Ulead Video Studio, and even Adobe Premier Pro.  There are pluses and minuses on most of them (I say ""most"" because some are all ""minus"" and no ""plus"").  For example, while Adobe Premier Pro is super powerful, I can never figure out how to do what I want to do on it (not to mention it is super expensive if you don't know somebody who works for Adobe and can get it for you for like 10% of the original cost).

So, what is a budding video editor to do?  What suite should they buy?

I still love Pinnacle Studio and from my experience (not that I do this every day or anything), they have really polished their software and it is not buggy like the old versions used to be.  If you choose this suite, you'll be able to do most anything you want.  As a side note, I also really enjoy using PowerDirector for the same reasons--powerful and easy to use.  However, this version of Pinnacle Studio comes with a bonus that I got excited about: live screen captures!  There have been many times I've wanted to be able to record what I was doing on screen, but when last I seriously looked into it (a while ago, I admit) all the software to do it was expensive and I didn't want to spend money on it.  Now I get it as a free bonus to an already great program.

Also
I was sad to learn a few years ago that Corel bought Pinnacle.  I'm not a fan of Corel, primarily because I don't like their tendency to use the Protexis licensing service due to the fact that I have noticed system stability issues from it (Corel Video Studio lived on my computer for about 1 day before I uninstalled it and threw it out).  This is why I was thrilled to learn that even though Pinnacle is owned by Corel, it did not install Protexis.  YAY!

As I continue to use Pinnacle Studio 18, I'll update if I find any issues, but so far I'm very happy with it.

I liked that so much functionality was bundled together: virus protection /detection, phishing protection, maintenance and backup all in one. I bought licences 2008 through 2013 and especially liked when the option to buy it for multiple devices was introduced. In 2014, shopping around to find a good renewal price, I learned Norton was pushing renewals to Security, that 360 was being phased out. I went with Security and remained happy; from my perspective, I couldn't tell any difference except for the product's name change. This year I was approaching the deadline to renew and was still trying to find a discount. I've learned that software is an item that can vary widely in price; it's not unusual to find it from 3rd parties for as much as 75% less than buying from the manufacturer. Obviously, I jumped on the chance to get the 10 Device version of Security free to evaluate. However, I'd have happily bought it for the price it was being offered at that day (still that price today). I like everything about the product, but have some issues with the degree of preplanning and extra steps necessary to not pay full price, but that's my hangup. For convenience, Norton will happily store account information and automatically walk customers through the annual renewal process for which they bill whatever the full price is at the time. Personally, I hate software renewals setup to auto bill and download. Therefore, I don't agree to it and choose to do it manually. Norton doesn't make it as easy. In the last few years I've become accustomed to using Norton's removal tool to get it off each device on the day I'm going to review. Then I do a complete install of the latest year's version and reconnect each device to my Norton account. It's a hassle, plain and simple, but worth it to me to save some money. People whose time is worth more than mine can avoid the hoops I jump through to save a buck; just sign up for Norton's EZ-PZ auto renew process.

Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.

This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.

First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.

The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.

Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems.

The product was way ahead of its time then. This new version for Mac feels like it has a little catching up to do.

At least with current versions, you don't have to read nearly an hour of text to train it to learn your voice and speech patterns.  While there is still some of that, it's greatly reduced and gives you immediate feedback if there's a problem with interpretation.  Also a plus for the current version are the video tutorials which provide a detailed getting started primer for those who are new to the program.  I found these tutorials helpful even though I've had a lot of experience with Dragon products.

My test of dictation into Word went well, with less than 1% of what I dictated being interpreted incorrectly, and even that was mostly due to the technical words I used not being in normal public vocabulary.

The only real disappointment for me was the sluggishness with which the software responded to commands aimed at the computer, i.e, open Word, email John, etc.  I'm on a MacBook Pro with full RAM, so the system isn't the issue.  It just seemed response times to commands were slower than they should be, as though the software was trying to figure out exactly what Word was, and how to open it.  While it does get the requested programs open, and takes dictation into them expertly, I was expecting more.  Could be my expectations are too high, but I don't think so.

The more I use Dragon, the better it responds.  It's true that it is constantly adjusting itself to your voice and speech patterns, so I've noticed improvement in dictation.  I have no problem with the program crashing as others have reported, and generally find it easy to dictate anything that I would normally type, with the exception of numbers into a spreadsheet.  But who would want to dictate those?

I recommend this program to Mac users as a good dictation interface.  Don't expect it to behave like it does in the TV commercials.  It's not THAT fast.

Very easy to install, once running I must say I was impressed with the performance, quite an enhancement once compared to Ulead 11.5, considering the program is working with very heavy HD files.

The interface for editing videos or creating slideshows is unbelievable easy to use, you can even drag and drop and then select your desired object to edit or add effects, text and filters to it. My first project was a video comprised of several short ones of my almost two year old son. I was able to edit, add music, transitions and effects without any problems at all. One thing that happened to me though, is that while editing, the VideoStudioProX7 recognized all video formats I used (even .mov, which was not recognized by the older version) I saved the project and when I opened it the day after, all my .mov videos were unlinked and could not be added, if I tried to, the application would error out indicating an invalid file format. I tried to find answers on the web and was unable to (understandable being this a new version), I exited the application, reopened it and all my videos were there. It was very odd but I thought I'd mention it should it happen to someone else.

As a heavy user of this type of applications (not professionally of course, mostly family videos and the like) I can definitely recommend the ProX7, while very similar to older versions in its front end, there are a great deal of enhancements, templates and new features that make it worth the upgrade.","A great deal of enhancements, templates and new features make it worth the upgrade",1400025600,,

It's now stable, attractive and quite capable for many businesses.  If you have never used Quickbooks before,  give the Mac version a try for your business.  If your company deals with a single currency, is service-oriented, or if product-oriented has simple inventory needs, Quickbooks for Mac 2013 could fit your needs well.

My wife and I still use Quickbooks for Windows on our Macs for about a dozen companies by running the Windows version under&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parallels-Desktop-8-for-Mac/dp/B008YTAKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac</a>.  But, for several of these companies, Quickbooks for Mac is now a viable option.  It still lacks the full feature sets of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Pro-2013-Download/dp/B008S0IWNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Pro 2013 [Download</a>], much less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Accountant-2013-Download/dp/B008S0J1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Accountant 2013 [Download</a>], which is why most of the companies we work with will stay on the Windows version for now in spite of the additional complexity of running Parallels Desktop on our Macs.

Quickbooks for Mac 2013 permits batch invoicing (perfect for homeowner's associations and businesses that bill a group of clients a similar amount), payments via Intuit Payment Network (no monthly fee e-checks and credit card payments), and the ability to attach documents to transactions.  It supports up to 5 users on the same local network working in one company file at the same time (per-user licenses required), with user-permissions that limit what each person can see and do.  Since 2012, it has supported progress or phased invoices, useful for contractors and architects, for example.

QBMac still uses the floating window paradigm, one which Apple, Adobe and others are moving away from for Mac applications  (e.g., Aperture, Final Cut, iMovie, iPhoto, Photoshop, Dreamweaver), but it remembers the last location and size of each window, so you can create a working layout of activity windows that suits your needs - you'll just see whatever other application windows are behind these as with all old-style Mac apps.

The new Guide Me window automatically changes its content to reflect help and guidance for whatever you are doing, however many of the videos simply display ""Work in Progress"" when you click on them.  Some of those that do work have muddy sound and are compressed so much that you cannot read the screen text.

A personal thing due to my age:  Most program text in QBMac is quite small on my 27"" Apple LED Cinema display which, as with most Apple laptops, has a higher pixels-per-inch PPI than older monitors.  I'd like to see Intuit give us the option of changing the type size, the size of which strains my aging eyes, even with special computer glasses.  It is the tiniest text of any program I work with.  (Palette text in some other programs is the same size - but not functional dialogs/windows.  My workaround is to drag QBMac onto an old secondary monitor that is 72 ppi.)  An exception to this is the left-column list of customer:jobs, vendors, etc in the Invoice, Enter Bills etc windows - this is extremely readable for me.  Registers, not so much.  I don't need any of Apple's 'Universal Access' features for anything else on my Mac, so adding 'zoom' or changing from non-native screen resolution just for QBMac is not something I'm willing to consider.

For the few companies I have that would work with the feature set of Quickbooks for Mac, there are still small things that will keep me on the Windows version... but only because it's already running on my Mac.  If I wasn't already set up with Quickbooks for Windows, I might force myself to live with these issues in Quickbooks for Mac:

1.  Consultants, attorneys, accountants, architects, graphics artists, etc. often like to record their time while the work is actually being done.  The QBWin Enter Single Activity window has a timer built-in.  It's so easy to start the timer and add additional notes as you work on a task.  If the phone rings, or you have to work on another task for a while, just stop that activity, to be returned to later, and start a new one for the phone call.  Etc.  When you return to an earlier activity, just start the timer again to continue on, adding additional notes and obtaining a total time entry for that one task which can later be transferred, with the notes (optional), as a single line to an invoice.  With QBMac, there is no built-in timer.  Instead, you must download the separate My Time application via the Customers > Time Tracking > Download My Time menu, and remember to refresh its lists every time you add or edit a customer:job or billable item (no dynamic linking to your company data).  My Time saves a separate time entry each time you pause it.  These entries can be merged when you export back into QBMac, but not with the same per-activity result as QBWin if you continue to add additional notes for what is intended as a single billable entry.  In general, I find having to launch a separate app (My Time) that requires management and export to keep the company file up to date an unnecessary additional level of complexity over time tracking within QBWin.  QBMac just needs to add a timer button to their Single Activity window, as has been requested for many years.

2.  QBMac now allows very long Notes fields for time and invoice entries, and thus is able to import that data from a QBWin file without data loss.  (QBMac 2010, e.g., truncated all imported notes and did not allow data entry of long notes.)  However, none of those fields expands to show the data or displays a scroll bar.  For example, in an invoice, only a single line is displayed - making it nearly impossible to edit a multi-line note.  You can only see the multiple lines if you switch to preview mode - but you cannot edit there.  (This contrasts with the Windows version which wraps the notes in the invoice, giving a live, editable preview.)

3.  QBMac doesn't work with Intuit's convenient GoPayment system unless you sign up for a merchant services account at a monthly fee.  For QBWin users, GoPayment is free of fees other than transaction fees.

4.  QBMac still only works with Intuit's online payroll, which starts at $25/month.  This $300 per year compares to the street price of about $50/year for the basic 3-employee payroll for QBWin.  One company we have has a single part-time employee with under $4,000/year in wages.  The $300/year Intuit fee is just unreasonable for us.

5.  Column width cannot be changed in forms (Bills, Invoices, General Journal, etc) - and thus complete data cannot be read.  For example, if you have nested subaccounts, you'll have no idea what the actual account is by viewing one of these forms unless you click on the account control. Ditto customer:job if the customer name is long.  Dynamic column resizing (and remembering user preferences) is essential (and works in the Windows version).

Conversion of QBWin files to QBMac format improves each year, for those who are either migrating, or need to send their file back and forth to a bookkeeper or accountant on the other platform.  As always, it is important to know what things do convert and which things do not.  QBMac does not have a means of importing accountant changes or journal entries, and so if a file is sent to an accountant, the QBMac user must not do anything in their copy of the file until they receive the file back from the accountant/bookkeeper.  (This differs from the abilities of QBWin.)

Bottom line:  Quickbooks for Mac 2013 is a solid release that can address the bookkeeping needs of many types of small businesses.  Intuit offers a free trial, and I encourage you to download it to see if your business needs are met by the product.  For myself, as a Quickbooks for Windows user who wants to switch, Intuit needs to resolve the issues in this review before I would migrate.  Naturally, I also look forward to the day that the Mac product achieves feature-parity with the Windows product so that we can completely leave Windows behind.",A good choice for many small businesses,1352937600,17,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OqeipmxVL._SY88.png']

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.

An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.

Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.

It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.","Annual expense, but some neat benefits",1381190400,,

Because most of us are already protected from most internet threats by our Internet Service Provider. For example, the router supplied by my DSL provider has a firewall. My domain host screens for viruses and other malware. And, of course, I don't open attachments from strangers or even many of the people I know.

  Additionally, there are many free utilities that perform many of the same tasks with less burden on the computer and less intrusively.

  So I simply can't realistically evaluate this package in terms of how well it performs its basic functions.

  Those services who do test programs such as this for their actual effectiveness put McAfee Internet Security Internet Suite in the middle of the pack.  I'll have to take their word for it.

  Installation is no more difficult than it should be on a computer running Windows XP. I have not tested it on Windows Vista.

  In terms of operation, McAfee puts a burden on the CPU, much the same way the Norton competitor does. McAfee is very intrusive with popups and warnings and, frankly, is irritating.

  The very worst feature, in my opinion, is the enforced automatic renewal plan. You are compelled to provide a credit card number in the installation process to sign up for this dubious benefit. Yes, you can cancel, but not through McAfee's web site. No, you have to use Chat, Email or Telephone which require 8, 7 and 5 steps respectively. None of these methods provide instant cancellation.

  If it were not for this ""benefit"", I might have given the product three stars. Because of it, I was tempted to give it one star. I find it offensive that a software publisher demands I obligate myself to a financial committment before I have even used the product - and makes me jump through hoops to cancel this forced purchase. McAfee also offers a 30 day refund policy on the entire product.

  Overall, ignoring the forced renewal subscription agreement, the product is about average. A bit more streamlined than Norton, it is also more intrusive. It costs a bit less for three computer coverage than Norton. On the whole, computer users are well advised to research and consider both free and other commercial offerings before choosing this product. And if you do purchase this product, be very wary of their forced automatic renewal.

Vegas Pro 8, of course, is a much higher-end product than Roxio Easy Media Creator (version 8 referred to herein for comparative purposes), but here are some reasons why you may wish to reconsider:

1.  First and foremost, if you're serious about video editing and wish to explore new and creative ways to create DVD's, this one is a must.  Roxio will continue to place annoying limitations like 60 second menus.

2.  The controls are far more intuitive.  Creating a slow-motion shot in Vegas Pro 8 is as simple as ctrl+clicking and dragging a video clip to the desired length.  Roxio is a frustrating experience of playing with film speeds until the shoe fits.

3.  Playback while editing is no longer a processing problem with Vegas 8.  Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 (on a Pentium 4 2.6 GHZ Hyper-thread, 1 GB of RAM, and a 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 card) has an annoying tendency to choke and run home to mommy when another process happens to run at the same time.  Vegas Pro 8 takes it all in stride.

4.  RENDERING.  OH, YES, RENDERING.  Roxio seems to think that everything needs to be re-rendered even if the edited video was already an MPEG-2 to start with.  VEGAS PRO 8 DOES NOT DO THIS - if it's already in the right format, it won't ruin the quality by recompressing.

5.  RENDER QUALITY.  Roxio offers constant bit rate encoding.  Period.  Vegas Pro 8 offers 2-pass variable bitrate encoding which allows longer videos to be placed on a DVD, while compressing it at a variable rate so that segments requiring higher quality get what they deserve and segments that are relatively static (i.e., pictures) can be compressed at a much lower rate.  Also, a 9 MBPS video encode from Vegas Pro 8 looks better than a 9 MBPS from Roxio.

6.  Capturing.  Vegas will tell me if my mini DV tape had dropped frames (and so far it has not happened at all); Roxio will not (and it HAS).  I'll make a DVD with Roxio and...surprise!!  I need to recapture that portion of the video because it's shot!!

7.  Bugs.  Roxio is buggy...VERY buggy.  Every time I try to make additional copies of a disc image that I put on my hard drive (because I don't want to live through another Roxio video encode), approximately 25-30 error messages (no, I'm not joking) will pop up that I have to repeatedly close out of before I can use the burn utility.  Not to mention that the initial install of Roxio caused my computer to forget that I had a CD-ROM or a DVD drive.  I had to edit my registry keys so that I could ""find them"" again.  Vegas Pro 8 has had ZERO issues with me.

There's more, but why go further?  If you're serious about video editing and production, don't settle for less.  This program will do it all from video editing, importing, capturing, image effects, DVD creation (including menus), and Dolby Digital AC-3 encoding (INCLUDING 5.1!!).  I have only scratched the surface of its full potential--there are plenty of tools to explore in there that can allow you to create very professional looking DVD's.

I previously reviewed the Home & Student Edition on my old G4 Mac Mini. I recently bought a new Intel based Mac Mini (2.0 GHz) with 4 GB of RAM, from Amazon. I also got the ""full"" copy of MS Office Mac. I had thought it would be a more fully featured version. But, it is NOT. For about three times the money you get MS Exchange compatibility and two LESS licenses. I really didn't fully understand this at first. Now I do. Unless you absolutely need Exchange in Entourage, there is no need to buy this version. Save the money and get the Home version.  I also need to correct some of my earlier review, which I will quote and amend below.

To start the installation process, even on the new Mini took forever. I am estimating an hour to no more updates needed. That was quite an ordeal! It really should have been one big update and reboot and done, it was not. It was over and over and over rebooting and updating. Phew!

""Entourage is the answer to Outlook. It's pretty good as a mail client and contact and appointment organizer. It also successfully synced to my Mobile Me account. It's much slicker than the Mac Mail client but you'd hope it was for a for sale product.  It is nice to have mail contacts and calendar in one program as it belongs. This is the best reason for Entourage, consolidation of the obvious. Apple insists they be separate.""  Well that was earlier. Now I can't get Mobile Me (which Office continues to call .Mac, really Microsoft?) to properly sync the calendar. This is a major pain! It worked earlier and now it doesn't. I was working earlier on Tiger now I'm on Leopard, is that why? I don't know. I really wanted to use Entourage but now it's useless to me.

""Excel and Power Point are the more business oriented, apps included in Office. They function well and as expected but on a G4 a little slowly.  Excel provides spreadsheet capabilities and Powerpoint, does presentations. ""  No real changes here these two operate juts fine and as they should.

""A bonus app is Microsoft Messenger. Readily available on the web, but included in this app for easy installation.""  Still there and still works, but I wonder how many true Mac people will actually use this client.

Overall a very comprehensive package, but for around $300 it really is overpriced and not worth the extra cost unless you absolutely need Exchange and absolute Office compatibility.  It competes with the free open source office apps like ""Open Office"" and FREE is a compelling price!  It also is the standard by which other office apps are measured and keeps that lead in check. My only reservation is if you have an older Mac, PowerPC based, you will find it too slow.

Day to day operations are quite quick on the new Mini and assume even better on more powerful Macs.  I have to wonder if this version is even needed with Apple building Exchange right into the next OS??","Lots of issues here, not good ones",1245628800,2,

ABSOLUTELY!  Do you need an antispyware (ASW) program if you web surf?  You probably should.  Do you need Trend Micro's AV and ASW 2010?  Uhm, no.

TM's AV is BASIC.  If you have to pay for this, you can get the same basic AV capabilities using free online software (do a google search on free antivirus).  You'll note that when you look at the back of the box--not shown on Amazon, you can see that our of all the nifty gadgets and gizmos that TM AV premium has, and wonder why the heck you bought the basic version--there's not much there.

Sure, TM's AV/ASW 2010 quotes itself for being optimized for WINXP, WINVISTA, and WIN7, but to tell the truth, so do all the other AV's out there.  And guess what?  There's no proof in the pudding.  It's no faster or slower than anything else out there, but there's not much to the program, so yeah, it's probably much quicker than its premium cousins.  Big surprise.

TM's AV/ASW 2010 has a feature that is kind of odd is its behavioral engine--I have no idea what it does, and you'll never find out in the manual either.  Also, it does the basic quick scans, full scans, and scheduled scans, but the timing for the scheduler leaves A LOT to be desired.

Bottom line: should you purchase this?  If you don't do the research on any other AV program, and you really want to have basic AV protection, then yes.  However, I'd say just get a little web search savvy and pick up some freeware OR go to the well-established AV products from the ""other"" companies.",This is Trend Micro's Way of Getting You to Buy Their Premium Package,1262736000,2,

1595,5,False,"01 4, 2010",A2LKYBW6V90PMJ,B000Q1OTTG,,Dubbie,"As a longtime Quicken user (8 years) and MicroSoft Money user (3 years) I was very disappointed when I switched to a Mac Pro last January (2009) and found no version of Money and the only available Quicken was a 2007 (pretty much unsupported and un-updated) product!

I refused to put a Windows OS on my new Mac - that would open the machine up to Windows virus attacks and other problems.

I tried ""Crossover"" which allowed me to use a Quicken for Windows program but did not require a Window OS.  That was ok but it was slow, a bit buggy, and there was no interface with ICal (so no easy alerts).

Then I found IBank!!

Not only did IBank work beautifully with my Leopard and Snow Leopard OS but it put dates and reminders into ICal with no problem.  I was very happy that it looked like a true Mac program instead of a Windows program.

Now, after 8 months of using IBank (the last version is 3.5.4) I can tell you honestly -- for my use as a home owner, on-line bill payer, watcher of credit card charges, and user of paperless monthly statements from 2 banks and 2 credit card companies -- I am VERY VERY HAPPY and please with IBank.

I highly recommend IBank!  You can use the full program for 30 days before you buy it OR you can buy it and return it for 100% money back if you do not find it to be what you need.

Amazon offers a $20 credit for people who switch to IBank from Quicken -- making the program cost $39.95 instead of $59.95!  What is not to like about that?

I have used IBank's customer service  two different times and found them to be knowledgeable, efficient, and very helpful.  They answered both questions in my first contact.

Quicken is coming out with a Mac Financial software in February- finally.  It appears to be sort of a Quicken for Mac 2010.  I will not buy it or try it!!

Why?

I resent Intuit's attitude that Mac owners don't deserve an up-to-date program for 3 years.  I don't want to support that kind of treatment to a long-time customer.  Also Intuit's new program seems to be a limited version of their Quicken for Windows programs.  I strongly suggest you check out Inuit's Q & A about the February 2010 Mac program at quicken.com.  I doubt you will want a ""fluff"" but little ""meat"" Quicken on your Mac.

IBank has had 2 updates (free to version 3 owners) within my 8 months of owning the program.  Each update came with a new complete program download and all information from my previous IBank version was transferred with no problems.

The IBank program does not allow ""direct bill pay"" like the old Quicken I was accustomed to.  However -- many banks no longer allow that service any longer either.  Both of my checking account banks (Citizens and TD Bank) do not allow direct bill pay through third party financial software any longer so I did not really suffer a loss by switching to IBank.  That may be a ""security"" protection improvement?

IBank imports Quicken data from Windows and Mac with no problems.  Set up is easy for connecting and using most bank web sites.

I used Turbo Tax for Mac (both platforms are on most versions of TTax and TaxCut CDs) last year.  I do not import information from Quicken or IBank into TTax - oI do import the personal information from previous TurboTax for Windows programs.  I cannot say anything about importing data from IBank.

I think IBank does have a lot to offer and unless you have a business or are very wealthy -- IBank should do the job for you WITH all the dependable and helpful MAC features (and connections to ICal) that you expect from your Mac.

There are some very low ratings of IBank listed in these reviews!  I do not understand why.

I know that I have not had any of the problems addressed in the poor reviews.

If you have an Intel Mac or MacBook -- I do not think there will be a problem that IBank's free customer service could not fix.  However, if there is no ""fix"" for a problem you may experience with IBank -- you lose nothing!  Just take advantage of IBank's free trial money back guarantee!!

I had originally hoped it would be a viable desktop OS going forward but unfortunately it seems this is not to be. Microsoft made some much needed changes to the desktop experience after the Windows 8 disaster, however they did this at some expense to the touch experience. The user interface continues the flat, sparse trend that started with Windows 8. The icons look like placeholders hastily drawn in mspaint and the whole interface just feels stripped out, sparse and unfinished with huge amounts of screen-wasting white space. The result is an operating system that still doesn't come close to Windows 7 on the desktop and isn't as good as Windows 8 on a touch device. On top of that, it throws out any performance advantage Win8 may have had over Win7, and it feels more like a platform to push Microsoft subscription services and paid apps than a desktop operating system. Then there are the mandated updates which are not limited just to security patches but can include arbitrary changes to the UI or features. In a nutshell, by obsessing over this one OS, one experience across the board, Microsoft has created the Spork of operating systems that tries to be everything to everyone and doesn't do a particularly good job at anything.

Overall, this product is about as easy to use as its competitors at first glance, but the tutorials and clean interface make it something that is relatively easy to use with practice.

I just installed both on my Dell laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510) which I just bought in January.  In PC World, they maintain you can also install those same MS versions in Win8, but I'm so antagonistic to Win8 I've not installed it, yet.  Original review follows below.

==================

Imagine, if you will, the annual How-to-Alienate-the-Customer Meeting in Redmond, Washington, aka 'upgrade' plan, for MS software.

Ms. Snippy (proudly):  Well, we've redesigned the interface yet again, just like aisles in grocery stores, so the customer will be confused, feel stupid; so will subscribe to our paid help.  Yet we added a cute dog to slow the search process, make it harder to search than prior;  we also reduced the number and types of files search can read, and made the Indexing Service more annoying.  We also forced the interface colors to glare blue and glare white, to increase eyestrain. Thus we can truly call this product 'new'.

Mr. Fleece-the-Customer Project Manager (smiling):  Wonderful, Snippy! But is that all?  Those changes won't confuse the customer long enough;  soon they will stop subscribing to our ignorant help hot lines.

Ms. Snippy (bubbling over): Oh, we've done much more.  Starting with, reducing backwards-compatibility with our own earlier software, and popular programs like Lotus 1-2-3 and Adobe Acrobat; so now it will cost those companies more, to sync with our 'new' software.  And less of their own products, will be read by OUR software, just the same!

Mr. Fleece (eyes wide):  aha, so we can blame them for lack of compatibility, and make more money thereby.  Well done, Snippy!

Ms. Snippy (ecstatic):  Well, here's the best part: we create NEW JOBS!  For now ALL the older material must be retyped or reformatted within our own products, thousands of hours of NEW WORK spent on old material which used to be converted in an instant!  That extra work, is good for America!

Mr. Fleece (with the Arm-and-Hammer look):  yes, teaches the customer a lesson that he shouldn't go anywhere but to us!  for all his software needs.

Ms. Nudger (sheepishly):  Um, excuse me.  We've also made our own earlier products incompatible with the 'new' version.  So how do we blame the other software companies, when in fact we also are incompatible with our own products?

Mr. Fleece:  Can't you recognize 'progress'?  It's the policy here to force people to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, never ending, never matching, never fitting the past -- just like DETROIT proudly does with American cars!  You're UNAMERICAN, Nudger; and you're FIRED!

===========

The above fictional conversation is not wholly fictional.  Eleven years ago, my one and only pay-for-help hour spent with a Microsoft employee basically resulted in him admitting Fleece's last lines.  In the name of progress.  I kid you not.  The rest of the fictional conversation is easily deduced by the actual history of MS products.  So too, here with Word 2003, when the elimination of backwards-compatibility, really begins.  Later versions of Office are even worse.  I've tried and rejected them.  But after reading reviews of how Word 2003 allegedly fixed the bugs with respect to right-to-left text (i.e., Hebrew), I wanted to try this.  Yeah, what a mistake!  Two copies I bought, both of them nearly useless!

Why?  Um, if you can't even retrieve your own previous files in the 'upgrade' version, then why upgrade?  Hmmmm?

For every 'upgrade' of Office becomes more and more dysfunctional.  I bought Word 2003 due to the many bugs in Word 2000-2002, but guess what?  Word 2003 TOOK AWAY what was good in those older programs, and substituted even more bugs and dysfunctionality.  That 'progress' continues from Word 2003, onward.  OFFICE and hence Word 2010 is so incompatible, after downloading the trial version in only two hours I was so frustrated, I uninstalled it. With difficulty.

Here's the scam: the 'upgrades' are like the opening dialogue, above.  The 'upgrades' complicate procedures which were simple in earlier versions, especially in Word and Excel, prior to version 2003.  For example, you used to just click on Help, and you actually got a chm file OF Help.  Not now.  Now, the DEFAULT in Word takes you ONLINE.  Takes two hours to figure out how to change that default, so you can get the old help file you're used to.  So too, the ? in a dialogue box USED to function simply: you clicked on the ?, then moved your mouse to the section on the dialogue box you wanted to understand, and got a semi-coherent explanation of that section's function.  Not now.  Now, another dialogue box opens with a lot more text, and you must SCROLL SCROLL SCROLL to find the item you could have gotten in 2 seconds, under the old method.  With no more coherence, of course.  Often, even less.  Help like this:  if the dialogue box says 'make operation operational', of course you have no idea what 'operation' is in view.  So in the old days, you clicked on ? and you got a tool tip which said, 'this function makes the operation, operational'.  That of course elucidated nothing, but at least it was fast.  Now, in Word 2003, you get the same message, but it took you three or four minutes to even FIND the same line of text as in the dialogue box, within the new and de-proved help file.  That is, after you spent two hours figuring out how to turn off the default ONLINE help which of course never helped you, either.

It's not by accident that most law firms still offer backwards-compatible documents for Word97-2003.  They have to.  Legal and accounting stuff has to be kept for YEARS.  Notice the range of the offering.  2003 and prior.  Word 2003, however, is far less desirable than prior versions: its clipboard is worse, its buttons are harder to customize and actually they removed some useful button customizations like Reveal Formatting;  the PERMISSION annoyance (covered below) means you might have to go through all your old documents and establish permissions, even on your own computer (problem on XP Pro, not Home).  And frankly, I don't see any functions which are improved, versus Word 2002.  Only new annoyances.

The usual company retort to complaints like mine, is to deem the customer ignorant of computers, puh!  Balderdash.  I've been working with computers since Trash-80.  I still have my old 286's, and they still work.  Admirably.  So it's not like I'm a computer neophyte, and my business depends on word processing and spreadsheets.  To date, nothing beats Multimate II (a DOS product) for merges, and DOS (not Windows) Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, for calculations.  All Excel has to offer, is formatting the final product.

To wit:  oh, now in Excel 2003, you can't retrieve Lotus 1-2-3 wk1 files, but get a 'restricted policy' notice.  By the way, this very 'policy' is itself buggy.  If I use XP Home, I don't get the problem.  It only occurs with XP Pro.  See?  MS products don't work with each other.  That lone $90 hour I spent paying for MS help years ago, resulted in this gem of explanation:  each programmer only gets certain subroutines to write.  The programmers are isolated, and don't get to see how the product fits together.  So OF COURSE there will be bugs.  Design requires a wholistic approach, which at MS, is anathema.  Okay, then: their products will waste billions of dollars in customer time trying to work around the bugs.  Not to mention, eventually MS will tank due to such a stupid policy.  But I digress...

Back to the problem: you can't open your own files when you are the administrator?  And you're not told how to get permission?  Oh, wait: you can ONLY get permission if you use Microsoft's ONLINE PASSPORT SERVICE?  Access to your own computer not online, depends on you establishing credentials online? Oh but yes!  You download a silly 'rights management' program which you can't even install, unless you subscribe to NET passport ONLINE, which means to access your own files on your own computer to use them in Office, you have to BE online, establish your credentials, and only THEN can you open your own documents on your own computer.  What drunk thought of that?  And of course, if MS voluntarily ends the PASSPORT program, then you can't even do that convoluted and needless procedure to open your own documents on your own computer offline.

So MS won't even allow you the administrator to control your own computer, with Word 2003. So here's the scam workaround: you have to settle for XP Home, or contact them in Redmond; of course you wait for an hour on the phone, then for $90 per hour they will be happy to spend four more hours 'helping' you to solve THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL BUG.  Of course, the 'help' person at MS knows absolutely nothing about the software, so first you go through irrelevant questions like do you have a virus, in order to eat up time and cost you more money.

Forget the other junk in the Suite.  It works not at all.  The Outlook 2003 was so badly designed I just flat removed it.

Excel is totally retarded, for audit-trail accounting.  Everything about its structure is buggy and arcane.  I spent FOUR HOURS today, just trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize a labelled number, as a LABEL.  Previous version of Excel had the opposite bug: if you typed in a number, it automatically treated it as a label, unless you put an equals or plus or minus sign in front of the number.  Sheesh.  But at least Excel 2002 and prior, would recognize the label marker and treat what followed AS a label.  (This matters: say you're doing billing like I was, and you wanted to LABEL a billing amount, to keep it out of your totals;  in Excel 2002 and prior, you can do that easily.  But NOT, in Excel 2003, and no FUNCTION formula will let you do it.  More could be said, but then I'll have apoplexy.)

By contrast, old DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x -- which IBM owns now, and won't sell -- along with its add-in (nee: Funk Software) 'Worksheet Utilities' is totally superior, especially for actuarial and other number-intensive, date-intensive, audit-trail-intensive calculations.  Runs in a DOS window in XP, and I'm told by my computer guys that I can get a DOS window in Win7, so might upgrade to Win7.  Whew.  Calculation in our modern computers is instantaneous.  DOS rocks.  So too, that version of Lotus.  Later versions don't work well with dates.  Forget the later Quattro Pro, too.

Excel's only good for formatting the final reports, and even then inanely won't let you store print STYLES without extreme effort: you do it by setting up your windows, print area, then name the whole thing as a CUSTOM VIEW.  Forget macros.

I could spend hours ranting about the flaws in Word or Office Professional, vintage 2010 backwards.  Word is totally incapable of a decent merge, for example.  The trouble you have to go to in order to make merging work in Word, means that unless you've got thousands of records, you might as well do it by hand.  And with thousands of records, count on half of them coming out wrong unless yhou spend thousands of hours designing a very precise database which is thirty times harder to manage, versus the old DOS days.  Unbelievable.  No wonder prices rise so much.  We're all spending downtime trying to get basic word processing functions, to work!

So too, forget Front Page;  it's easier to write your own html code in Word.  Business Contact Manager?  You're better off with pencil and paper!  Access?  Someone on crack designed it. The Photo thingy isn't all that bad, but its bugs abound.  Outlook 2003 is the worst.  They removed all the flexibility of earlier Outlook versions, and of course made the interface completely frustrating, to boot.  Outlook has always been way overcomplicated, but if you have a lot of stuff to juggle and you use it daily (which you must, or you'll forget how) -- it can be helpful.  Simpler is old Sidekick in DOS.  Sigh, you can't store it in the UMB, in Windows.  But it works just fine on an old 486...

So instead of reading only my ranting -- Google on a MS program name, add the word 'sucks' -- you'll find even whole discussion forums devoted to that second word.  Usually such vulgar language is inapt.  But not here.  Every swear word ever invented, belongs to Office products and to MS software in general.  It's deliberately unintuitive, confusing, buggy and mediocre, so you have to subscribe to paid help.  That's the only explanation which makes sense of the data. Same can be said for Adobe, Roxio, Symantec and Corel products.  So MS isn't the only scammer in town.

Go back to DOS software:  its products work well on these faster machines.

Licensing:
it's about time Norton (and hopefully soon others) finally has realistic licensing. The three-device license is so obsolete it's laughable. If you include portable devices, that barely covers one person who owns a PC, Android phone and Android tablet, let alone an entire household of online users.  The base Norton Security includes licensing for up to five devices.  Norton Security with backup boosts that number up to 10 devices.  For that reason alone, I spent the extra ten bucks. We are a household of six users, a few of whom have multiple PCs. Luckily, we primarily use iOS tablets and smartphones.  So we can use all the licenses on our PCs.  Norton does a terrible job of conveying this info to the consumer and I even inadvertently ordered the base version wondering how I would protect all of our computers. They really need to put this info somewhere prominent, like right in the title like they did with the old three-license software.  The licensing difference isn't  even in the comparison chart between the regular and backup versions. That's why I made it the title of my review.

Registration, downloading and installation:
I was already familiar with the Norton management and their online delivery method because I would use it to download the latest version of Norton products. The site isn't the most intuitive but at least they apparently combined the old Norton accounts with Norton management. The two used to be separate sites. Things are much easier now. Simply go to Norton's web site, create a Norton account and you're ready to go. You then enter the product key for your current Norton license and it will unlock the subscription and add it to your account.  You will see your product along with any devices that currently have the product installed.  To install, simply access the site from each computer you wish to protect.  Log in and download the product. That's it.  The product will automatically activate after installation and you're all set. You can keep track of the installations and remove licenses as needed. Let's say you install it on a computer and the hard drive crashes or the motherboard fails.  You are no longer able to access the installation.  You throw the computer away and buy another.  No worries, simply log into your Norton account from the new computer, remove the old computer from the list of managed devices and it frees up the license for use on another device. Just download it to the new computer and go. As far as Android devices, simply download the app from the Google Play store, enter your Norton account info and it will unlock all the features.

Performance and effectiveness:
I have been using Norton for the past several years and I have to say it is the lightest and best it has ever been. Gone are the days of Norton using tons of system resources and deeply embedding itself within the registry and system files making it virtually impossible to remove.  The new client is small, light and every trace is removed upon uninstall.  If you still need reassurance that every trace is gone, Norton still makes its stand-alone Norton Removal Tool executable available for download. It will scan the system and remove all traces of Norton product. I always run it after a Norton uninstall as kind of a housekeeping step.  As far as protection, I have two teenagers and two college age children. I haven't had to clean a virus in years. We have gotten a warning or two over the years of malware being blocked, but nothing has ever made its home on any of our systems.  I routinely scan with a separate stand alone on-demand scanner or two as a safeguard.  So far, Norton has kept all the nasties at bay.  Speaking of scanning, Norton's scan speed is pretty good. Quick scans take a few minutes at most and full scans are much speedier than in the past, usually completing in 10 minutes or less.  There are other features like Facebook wall scanning and firewall features if you need the extra protection. Facebook links have gotten quite a few of my friends and relatives, usually in the most embarrassing of ways, like posting smut or malicious links to all their friend's walls under their name.  Other tools like a URL scanner (that integrates with your browser and works with most popular search engines), Norton Insight reputation reports,  password manager, and a basic parental monitoring feature can be helpful for those who need them, although I strongly suggest a more robust solution for parental monitoring. I've tried Norton's in the past.  Even their upgraded ""premier"" service left a lot to be desired.  A tech savvy kid could bypass it in minutes.  Some of the tools seem like a throwback to the old Norton Utilities days.  Some basic housekeeping and system monitoring tools like a system profiler, high resource allocation alert, Process manager and others accompany the 25GB of online backup (shared among all ten devices).  As I stated earlier, I bought the Norton with backup for the five extra licenses, not the backup. I have not used, nor do I intend to use, the online backup.  I prefer redundant local disks.  I'm old school.

So, for less than five bucks per device per year, I get Norton quality protection as well as a money-back guarantee if we encounter an infection that Norton cannot remove.  I don't know how Norton plans to honor that obligation (and I'm pretty sure there's likely some fine print hiding in there) but I fully intend to take them on their word if I get one infection that the program alone cannot remove. Much like my auto and homeowner's insurance, I'm hoping I never have to make a claim but it's good to know its there just in case.

Of course, nothing is perfect and Norton Security is not without it's cons which include:

* Inability to upgrade from prior versions - If you use an earlier Norton product and still have time remaining on your license, you can forget about downloading Norton Security and upgrading to the lastest version.  You'll have to finish out your existing subscription for your previous product first.

* Norton Security combines Norton Antivirus, 360 and Internet Security.  Some people preferred the lighter packages of NAV or NIS.  Not everyone wants the extras that were included in the 360 and Internet Security versions of Norton. The new all or nothing model will definitely turn some users off.  Unwanted bloat is just that, regardless of size.

* The new licensing and delivery scheme can be a little confusing if you've never dealt with Norton Management in the past and simply relied on physical installation media along with Liveupdate for all your update needs.

* Renewal rates directly through Symantec are still the software equivalent of paying full sticker price for the product.  As tempting and time-saving as it may seem, it is still more expensive to automatically renew rather than going through retail when your license expires.

* Norton Security for iOS is anything but. It offers zero protection against malware like the current wirelurker threat and the only useful tracking features it does offer are already available (and much more reliably) through iCloud.  That's why I didn't bother to mention it earlier.

* When you get close to renewal, Norton becomes as bad as the adware it fights.  I was in the middle of updating the firmware on a very expensive camera when out of the blue, Norton decided it was time for a random pop-up reminding me to renew.  I HATE nonsense like that.  If it must force annoying marketing tactics on me, at least set it to do so upon boot only and not completely random when something that could potentially be ruined is running.  As luck would have it, the auto-focus on this VERY expensive camera seems a little sluggish after the update.  Since I don't know if the culprit is a bad update file or Norton's adware popping up in the middle of the update, I'm now forced to uninstall and reinstall the update to be 100% sure.  To make sure Norton's adware doesn't zing me again, I'll use my Mac for the update next time.",Version w/backup covers up to TEN devices,1415404800,57,

I have to admit, however, that it seems like a small step down from Toast 10 in at least one way.

I have numerous live shows that I downloaded which were originally PAL and then burned to DVD in Toast 10, and the app gave me the option to transfer them to NTSC (and always required a dual-layer disc for some reason).  Now, from what I can see, Toast 11 offers absolutely no way to do this.  This is rather maddening because in the ""upgrade"" I lost a vital function.

But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by taking away the functionality of earlier versions. For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions; and to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions.

Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook (mostly) by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version.

1. They are forcing Quicken users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for online banking in earlier versions.

2. The newer version, Quicken 2009, is poorly functioning & buggy (as detailed by other reviewers too), not a better product.  The program shuts down every time I try to accept an individual downloaded transaction. The only way to stop that is to click on ""Accept all""

2. Periodically the programs refuses to read the file and I have to restore the backup file. I used to backup once a month with earlier versions and now I do it every time I exit the program.

4. Online support to download transactions is also limited: for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank.

5. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support. For all practical purposes there is no technical support. They do not even provide a tech support phone number to call. You can contact them from the web site when they provide you with a useless ticket number. Instead they direct to Quicken User Communities. After taking your money, they want other users of Quickbooks to provide you with technical support!

6. So Intuit got your money, you got a buggy software with poor functionality, and no technical support. You cannot even do now what you were able to do in an earlier version. You paid money to go from a functioning product to a buggy software.

What a trade off! Basically Intuit screwed you.

Purchasing Quicken is, of course, just the beginning of the upgrade ordeal. Real nightmare starts when  you start getting all those error messages.  After you install Quicken 2009, you will find that it has become cluttered with useless features that you do not even need.  At the end you are left with the feeling: Intuit has screwed me.

Every time you deal with Intuit, you will be left with a bad taste and hate for this company.  Not only they blackmail you into upgrading, every time you have to pay the full price of newer version, there is no upgrade price. And you can get Quicken cheaper at Amazon than buying from Intuit directly.

I have experience with a few products, including Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere, so this review is done with those products in mind.

Once installed, the first task I tried was to create a photo slideshow using one of the styles provided in the quick editor. Initially, I was impressed by the software's ability to work with Raw files, however, this doesn't use the exits stored in the .xmp data made in Adobe Bridge. This means they are straight out of camera without any edits, so it's better to work with processed jpgs. Personally speaking, this is quite sad, because it processes the jpgs out of the raw at an incredible speed.

Once you have selected the right style for your video, it will process your images into the template with accompanying music.

When that is finished you can preview it, and if you like how everything is arranged, you can go straight from there to produce the video, and from there to upload or share.

If your video needs refinement, you can open the video in the template editor. This allows you to change titles, etc. if they were a part of the template you selected.

Once the template driven video has been created, it will either output this to a final file or you can edit in advanced editing mode. Here you will have the initial creation as a clip, from where you can add elements before or after the clip to fully flesh out your video.

Pros
Very feature rich for the price
Absolutely superb for entry level users
Very similar layout to most video editing tools, so most features are where you might expect them
The ability to create final products using the templates is better than similar offerings from other video editing software.
Output options include seamless uploading to your YouTube or similar accounts, once the video has been rendered.
Comes with audio editor

Cons
When using the templates in the easy editor or the slideshow creator, it would be much better to be able to see an example of that template before importing your images into it to preview - maybe a mouse-over effect in the style thumbnail area.
Once a clip has been created  through the quick editor, and brought into the main timeline for advanced editing, I do not see a way to make further edits to that clip -- like rearranging the order of stills in a slide show, reducing the audio level of the bundled sound with that style, etc.
Since so many of the tools in this software look so similar to programs like Premiere, etc. it would be wonderful to have similar functionality like layer opacity easily accessible for editing. It may be possible to edit the opacity of a video layer in Power Director 13, but I can't find it, and that was after checking the help file.

It just crashed on me while I was moving the marker along the timeline, so I lost what I was working on....

When your edits are final and you want to produce the video, you can choose from standard 2D, 3D, Device or Online, but to the novice user, it is not obvious which type is best suited to email a video to a friend.

Summary - great for home user who is looking for something better than the simple products that only let you choose from templates. Because this has templates and advanced options, you can get more creative as your skill and inspiration increase.

For the casual users these days, that is hard to say, especially if a lot of people are happy with JUST a Smart Phone. But that is another discussion for another time. Is Office still a great choice? YES.

The first thing you will notice and these days, you don't get much on media. Everything has pretty much moved to download. Office 2016 is no exception. Depending on your speeds, downloads can take a good while. But installation was pretty easy. Activation can be a tad convoluted but just pay attention to the screen prompts.

I am a heave Excel user, so I spent the bulk of my time with it and digging into all of its features. It was fast and for the most part stable. One thing I've noticed in my small business environment, is that since the last batch of updates from Microsoft, VBA has been acting a little strange and so solution from Microsoft yet. Mostly when it deals with attacking an external XLA file to an Excel project when other sheets are open. The other apps are also quite good and I for one am a fan of the Ribbon. It is very functional and useful.

Office 2016 is focused on the cloud for sure but you can still save locally. It is as good idea to set up OneDrive, if you use it. DO note, the 1TB of OneDrive Space only applies if you use Office 365.

Which bring me to Office 365. Do you need a standalone Office copy these days? For us in a small business, yes. We looked into Office 365 and while we do use it for E-Mail, Skype for Business and SharePoint, it was too expensive up front to include Office. And a lot of people do not want recurring charges. Office 365 for the home user is a great value but standalone versions of office are still functional and you don't have to worry about the yearly renewal.

Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.
The locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!
Buyer Beware:
I *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of ""Invalid CHUNK file."" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well. There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time. When I selected the ""Second Chance"" feature, the game would inevitably lock up and my computer would crash again.

Now they've taken things to a whole new level with ads literally BUILT INTO the GUI (Graphic User Interface: the 'skin' with which you engage with the program). An example: in the new 'refinance calculator' there is a large banner ad for CHASE BANK. The refinance calculator itself is poor and majorly inferior to free ones available online, but more on that later. I don't expect to pay upwards of $50.00 for a piece of software that contains banner ads! That is simply unacceptable. In freeware, I understand it, but not in something I paid full retail for!

Adding insult to injury, INTUIT has actually removed one of the best features of previous Quicken releases, the CASH FLOW monthly chart. They've replaced it with a projected balances chart which is ugly, harder to read, and doesn't convey nearly as much information as the previous version. A line chart is inferior for the purpose, and INTUIT hasn't even managed to make the data points (low and high balance points along the chart) display the actual balance when you mouse over them. This is a miserably bad design--they've managed to take a very useful tool and turn it into garbage.

The supposed new features are junk. The refinance calculator is extremely simplistic compared to far better online versions (check out Equitrend Financial Calculators if you're looking for sophisticated, free calculators). It doesn't allow the user to enter current mortgage interest rate or PMI, and instead makes you enter the total payment and then the ""impound / escrow amount."" If you have your mortgage set-up to be tracked in Quicken, the tool cannot incorporate that data into your analysis. You must manually enter everything. The tool also does not take into account the tax implications of your refinance. Overall it is a tacked on, basic calculator that is nearly useless.

The obligatory re-skin of the program (which INTUIT trots out each year rather than making substantial or meaningful changes) is adequate, but unnecessary. Every year they tweak fonts, colors, and layout, and design elements. This year is no exception. None of the changes make the program more efficient for the end user. I don't have a problem with utilitarian designs, as long as the underlying software is substantial. INTUIT seems to leverage much of their development budget into GUI tweaks, while doing little to improve the software itself.

Another major issue is that INTUIT cannot manage to keep their data file consistent from year to year. 2011 is no exception and required me to convert my 2010 data file. Admittedly this was much more painless than the massive difficulty many experienced with upgrading from 2008 or 2009 to 2010. I wish that the developers at INTUIT would make a forwards compatible data file type and just stick with it.

SUMMARY:

PROS:

1) Potentially better GUI (depending on your preferences)

CONS:

1) Ads built into the GUI itself

2) Removal of a significant feature (cash flow and balance chart)

3) No substantial improvements to the underlying programs

4) Added 'features' are poor quality, even when compared with free alternatives

5) Requires yet another data-file conversion

6) Expensive! Especially considering the ads built into the program

FINAL THOUGHTS:

What am I getting for my money here? If you love this version of Quicken, can you kindly explain to me why it is worth upgrading? I have yet to find a single compelling reason. Am I missing something or did I just flush my money down the toilet?",How does this qualify as an upgrade?

Third, DVD/CD burning.  I wanted to burn an ISO to a DVD so I could install Ubuntu on a new system.  I never found the option for doing so.  Is there one?  I had to use Roxio instead.  I never got around to trying to take some home movies and make a DVD out of it.  Again, crashing/hanging.

I wanted something that, quite frankly, made doing my books a snap -- as easy as writing a letter -- and I found it with Microsoft Accounting Professional 2008.

First off, let me state this -- if you are an average user of the Microsoft Office suite of products then Accounting 2008 is going to be a snap for you to use.  They have went to great lengths to make sure you don't need an Accounting degree to understand it.  A lot of the features not only integrate extremely well with Office 2007, but will remind you a lot of using Office (minus the ribbon interface).

One of the really nice features of Accounting is the ability to add third-party add-ins.  Out of the box you get an integration module for Paypal, so your invoices can automatically generate Paypal requests and Accounting can automatically classify and deduct the fees for it from the appropriate accounts.  As your business grows, and you decide that you need to do direct credit card processing, Accounting 2008 lets you integrate with CC processors directly -- again, handling managing the costs and fees for you.

Dashboards are another strong feature of this product.  How is my business doing?  What is my accounts payable looking like?  How much cash do I have on hand?  All that information and more is available through quick, convenient dashboards.  You can drill down into the dashboards to pull up reports to see more detailed data.

If you use Business Contact Manager for Outlook then you are in for a treat -- it integrates directly with Accounting to help you track not only customer information, but also communications and marketing camapaigns!  No more having to hunt and search for emails sent months ago or wondering if your marketing campaigns via e-mail are working.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with the product.  I think it has been a welcome upgrade from Peachtree and thanks to its integration with other products really brings my business into a 360-view.  I know immediately how well things are doing, what my customers are up to, and what needs my attention.

If you own a small business then do yourself a favor and give this a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",Move Over Peachtree - There is a New Boss in Town,1206576000,4,

Seriously, it was so much fun, and I was constantly getting chills from the scary storyline.  I was really needing this game as before this game HERinteractive wasn't really doing too great with their games.

Story-Your neighbor has asked you to go to England to check on her daughter, Linda.  Linda has suddenly started hiding behind a curtain in her bedroom and refused to let anyone see her.  She has also started to have temper tantrums, which according to her mother are totally unlike her.  You soon realize that something supernatural may be behind this sudden change in behavior.

Graphics-Okay, so these didn't get too much better, but they are still good.  All the spooky areas are dark, while the mansion is always lit up, and I did find the artwork rather well done.

Sound-The voice acting was very good in my opinion as was the music.  There are lots of songs in this game, I thought, and I liked them all.

Gameplay-Everything is the same except you don't leave the manor ever and the puzzles are HARD.  This was the first game where I found there were tons of puzzles and they were challenging without being frustrating.  Whenever you get stuck you can ask a parrot for hints, but you cannot call Bess and George in this game although you can call Ned.

Fun-This game is so fun, and it is really scary, too.  I just want to mention that some people will not want to play this game because it does talk of witches, werewolves, alchemy, and rituals.  I didn't find it satanic or anything, but I think some people will want to skip this game if they don't like things like that.

Length-I must have played this 1 or 2 months!  It was so fun!  And, still, when I replay it, it takes me 12-15 hours to finish.  It is really long, and I loved that!

This is the perfect PC game that I recommend to everyone except those who are concerned about the above mentioned.  And, of course, small children should NOT play this game, but it is my favorite Nancy Drew game, if not my favorite PC game!",Scary + challenging + fun = perfect game!,1260835200,,

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from ""The Secret of the Old Clock"", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on ""Display"", then clicking on the ""Settings"" tab, then clicking the ""Advanced..."" button, then clicking the ""Performance"" tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to ""Full.""  Then you'll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!

Let's face it, LT is a slight step down, but for the money, it is quite the bargain for the steps it takes for you in professional drafting. Either way you look at it, you are playing with the big wigs because you can now speak their language. With full DWG compatibility, you are able to associate yourself and others with the most popular file format. If you are dealing with people with limitations, you are the one with the ability to provide previous formats for them to utilize, not the other way around. With LT you can use anything.  And if the people you are providing any of this for have nothing remotely possible to use any of your creations, well, you simply export a PDF version, or even JPG and TIF images. In some cases, you can cater to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  So, obviously, people you are sharing your work with do not have to own this software.  They only need it to interact with your project.

The customization features of the program is top-notch.  The software offers so many powerful features, but it's great to be able to sort and organize to your visual preference.

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.

9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called ""Forms Available"". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called ""Buy""  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy""  will turn into ""update"" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update. Thank you to Tech Impaired to spotted it and reported to H&R!

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

Tim Robertson
Publisher/Owner, Columnist, MacRelevant
Friday, 10/24/03
As the masses await the Fed-Ex truck to deliver to their eager hands a copy of the latest Mac OS X release from Apple, Panther, MyMac.com presents our early, first-look at the eagerly awaiting OS.
First impressions: Wow, this thing is fast! Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther.
Expos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So what's the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. What's more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock.
To access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back.
If you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop.
Expos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac.
Heads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you ""Tab"" to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X.
Welcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them.
Many people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows.
One neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used ""Software Update"" in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it.
Fast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate ""Enable Fast User Switching"" in the ""Accounts"" pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a ""Basic"" in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named ""Kids"" which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.)
So what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I don't think enough people utilize.
All in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months.

Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.

The good:

- The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.

- The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.

- The controls are easy to manage and tweak.

The bad:

- After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.

- 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.

I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.  This should reduce the probability of problems and needing to interact with Symantec itself.","May work well in the future, but avoid Symantec's online store",1173398400,218,

Each product has it strengths and weaknesses, but those considering a purchase of PaintShop Pro are usually broken into two groups:  (1) you want a powerful suite to edit photos but do not want to learn PhotoShop or (2) cannot afford PhotoShop and want the best bang for your buck.

Previous owners of PaintShop will likely love or hate this version.  They have made positive improvements and add many features.  Nike Color Efex Pro 3, and HDR (high dynamic range) module, and selective focus are among the additions.  There are other changes, but those are some of the most desired new features that people want to see in photo software today.

If you are looking for a powerful photo editing suite that is fairly quick and easy to learn, then try PaintShop Pro.  The learning curve isn't as bad as with PhotoShop and you still get a software suite that is packed with features that can handle everything from amateur home to use to many professional tasks.  You will have to take time to learn every feature, but you can start doing basic tasks very quickly.  The same goes for people who would love to have PhotoShop, but would like to stay on a budget.  PaintShop Pro offers one of the best bangs for your buck on the market.

Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is ""awesome"", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The ""start menu"", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the ""start menu"" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, ""ME"" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good.

As of December 2010 the announcement is official that the newer version will completely eliminate (and by this I mean ""break"") the way hard drives are managed in the current version.  What this means to you is that if you purchase this version of the Windows Home Server OS, you will be headed for a dead-end if your Windows Home Server hardware does not have its own RAID controller.  There are other workarounds for the issue, but those that I have seen thus far are complicated.  If you are looking at purchasing Windows Home Server, you might want to hold off until the new version comes out, or else commit yourself to staying with this version.

NOTE:  This product has gone far beyond the item listed here and is, as of 12/2009, up to ""Power Pack 3"".  If you cannot find a newer release of this product, make it a point immediately after installation to allow the Server to update itself before trying to properly set up the rest of your Windows Home Server.  It will save you a lot of trouble if you do this because the updates resolve a lot of issues.  Most importantly, Power Pack 3 adds compatibility with Windows 7 and fixes some serious problems with file indexing.

Windows Home Server (or ""WHS"") seems to serve two purposes:

1) to provide a very simple way of doing every useful ""home network"" type of task without having to know much about servers

2) to prevent anyone who is not a home user from trying to use the OS as any sort of formal Windows Server (such as for a business or as a web server)

This means that if you come from a background of managing servers and are used to managing things at the OS level, you really need to let that go. Things that seem like a can't-fail performance tweak or a standard ""best practice"" will actually destabilize Windows Home Server and eventually lead you off to rebuild-land, wondering how things went wrong.  Remoting into a Windows Home Server using anything besides the Windows Home Server Console will corrupt the installation and cause problems (more on this in a moment), once again leading you to rebuild.  This is a case where when Microsoft says, ""We don't support you doing that,"" they mean it.

The good news is, if you want to have your own server at home and you want it to be hassle-free, Windows Home Server will fit your needs.  99% of the tasks you perform are all in one place:  the Windows Home Server Console.  This rich graphical interface drives everything you'll do in managing and configuring your server.  It simplifies tasks and provides quick at-a-glance information on your server's status.

So what are some of those features?

Backup and mirroring:  Windows Home Server will enable you to back up your home computers to it.  These backups update themselves on a schedule that you set and can later be used to restore the machine if things go wrong.  Instead of using RAID for disk redundancy, Windows Home Server uses a technology called ""folder duplication.""  It seems bizarre to omit RAID from a server that's supposed to keep redundant copies, but here in Windows Home Server, it really is better suited to the OS' design.  It is also closely customizeable, allowing you to specifically set which folders should be duplicated for data protection.

Disk management:  it's easy to add or remove extra drives.  WHS uses drive letter mapping to make all volumes the ""D:\"" drive.  This drive letter is a logical mapping off the root physical volume, and your C:\ drive is deliberately limited to a much smaller volume in order to make restoring the server a snap on those hopefully-rare occasions when you have to.  Storage is balanced across volumes automatically and while watching it happen on my MediaSmart Ex495 I rarely see it impact performance.

Media sharing and streaming:  Using simple ""Music, Photos, Videos"" categories, you can control how to share media and also enable or disable streaming.  You can also enable/disable integration with Windows Media Center. Windows Media Center on your PCs will easily pick up on the existence of the server and walk you through installation of the plug-in once you have enabled this feature.  I found WMC integration to really be dirt-simple to set up and useful to have on all my machines, and I'm betting it integrates really well with an X-Box 360 as well.  I've used it with my Playstation 3 and it's been very easy to access through the PS3's Media Bar (or ""XMB"").  There are also the Firefly Server (which I have not used closely) and TwonkyMedia, which provides an alternative way of managing and streaming your content.  Last, there is iTunes functionality but I have not used this feature (there are many, MANY forums that can help you with this if you'd like to learn more).

The hard part of Windows Home Server is recognizing that it is best used on its own terms:  use the Windows Home Server Console to access the server and its settings, use the Windows Home Server Toolkit to do deeper ""expert"" tasks (and try to avoid doing these unless you have to), and most importantly do not remote into the box.  Windows Home Server carefully manages the installation and configuration of software, and accessing these programs from outside the console can cause problems.  More importantly, Microsoft's Windows Update pushes updates based on the machine's server core.  Windows Home Server uses Server 2003 as its core.  In plain English this means that Windows Home Server appears to Microsoft Update as if it's a Server 2003 box.  When the Console controls the updates, it is capable of filtering out the Server 2003 updates that are intended for WHS and those that aren't.  Remoting into the box will cause Windows Update to call and answer with the full list and add updates to the queue that WHS really shouldn't have.  Which is to say nothing of the default behavior of Remote Desktop Connection, which is to assume you want to share resources (such as printers, faxes, scanners on the network) with your remote session and try to install the drivers on the server while you're connected.

If you want a simple home media server, Windows Home Server will provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, self-maintaining way to do it.  However, you have to work within its rules and you need to be willing to let go of the lower-level things a typical Server administrator will do.  If you want a robust and configurable server machine that allows you to customize to your heart's content, you may not be happy with the loss of control WHS requires.  You might consider just installing your own server and being done with it.",Best if Used on its Own Terms,1267142400,10,

They historically have been ranked pretty high for great intervention and also for efficient use of space and RAM. Androids are getting to the point where they are the PC of the Smartphone industry: open source, ubiquitous, and vulnerable. So we need to have a strong security suite on our phones and tablets. But which one is still up in the air. The good news with most (including this one)? You can try it first.

If you download the Kaspersky app from the Amazon App Store or Play or direct link (usa.kaspersky .com/dl/mobile) you'll get a fully functional preview with a firewall. You can also select to try the full suite (this product) for 30 days for free. And you should.

It includes all the functionality that you may be used to with well known products (like one of my favorites Lookout Mobile Security) but also includes some stuff that those products usually dont.

Included:
+Antivirus, antispam, antispyware
+webpage blocking, phishing link alerts, (and really cool) antiphishing in texts (this is something we don't think of much but is a huge driver for exploit. We get a link in a text and don't worry too much about clicking it. That's an error. This app is supposed to stop that link.)
+High performance, low impact to data/ram/battery (I can tell you I had it running for an hour on a Galaxy S3 and checked battery usage and it wasn't even on the page of top users. The page ended at 2% so this app didn't even use 2% of the battery after an hour. That's pretty good. You will have to download an update the first time and it make bounce usage up to about 40 MB.)
+Anti-theft location, block, erase, mugshot (this is very similar to a host of other resources like Lookout, AVG, Norton, etc where you can remotely track your device using GPS, take pics of your thief through the front facing camera, and lock/ wipe your phone and CD card and even if your thief has changed SIMs which is a nice feature. Don't get too caught up on the GPS location as it isn't always acurate and you shouldn't go knocking on doors of unsavory people anyway. Just tell your local police department. I've used this to find phones that were misplaced. Once I found a phone that was in my home by locating it near my home on the map - so I knew it wasn't where I had just been. Another time I located it at a school so checked the field where we just were. Not exact but helps.)
+Call and text filtering (this is nice and brings Android in to the same level of control as iOS and Windows Phone 8 so you can block on a per call/ text basis)
+Privacy protection (I haven't used this yet. I guess if you have an unlocked phone and don't want people to see some stuff you can hide apps/ info if you hand the phone to them. I lock my phone so it's not necessary.)

Overall, this is an impressive program. I really love how little it is using in the background (both data and battery). I am not sold on paying much for these programs since there are a lot of free services you could get to do a very similar job.

I've expanded into a new business that includes a number of not-quite-employees, people I pay commissions to and need to 1099 at the end of the year. I also now have inventory to track. Enter the need for better accounting software to handle these added tracking issues without taking up too much of my time.

QuickBooks in the name to look toward for just such accounting needs... But starting from zero, with no previous QuickBooks knowledge, I'm finding it a steep climb to learn and use, and a time-consuming one at that. It is not an easy or intuitive start-up program to use.

Odd thing that strikes me, that may not bother those more familiar with the program, is the lack of ability to simply enter expenses and in a simple ""expense"" area, and tag them with the IRS standard categories I'll be entering for taxes at year's end. Instead this sort of entry seems to fall under ""vendors."" It seems to me a cumbersome way to go about what should be a simple entry, for example, for office supplies, whether I happen to buy printer paper at the grocery store or make a special trip to the office supply store.

I found window tabs and window resizing to fit my notebook computer cumbersome and sometimes difficult. The registration and setup process - while I had no major problems - did at points cause me difficulty because some popup windows had no scroll bars and ran off the bottom of my notebook screen, so I couldn't get to the ""submit"" buttons.

I was disappointed to be confronted immediately by it wanting a credit card to use the payroll part. I want to try things out and evaluate before committing to paying for upgrades. Without the credit card entered, with automatic renewals, I couldn't look at the employee payroll thing to see if it fit my needs, or if the cost to do 4 to 6 employees (who aren't really even 'employees') made it worthwhile.

Point to QuickBooks for having a ""Help"" section with writing in words, not just videos (they have videos, too). I HATE having to watch several minutes of videos only to learn it didn't answer my question (I just tried and rejected another accounting software service primarily because their help was *only* videos). But the help windows are tiny and do not resize, and the font is tiny, hard to read, and does not resize unless I resize my entire computer display sizing (really? for one program that lacks suitable adaptive ability?).

First, the installation is very easy.  None of my devices has a DVD drive anymore and instead I use a portable one.  This software is convenient because it simply includes a code so that you can create a McAfee account.  After you create an account, you can download the software onto any device of your choosing.  McAfee makes it easy to install the software on phones/tablets by sending you a link to download the software to your device.

I also like that when installing to Windows devices, you can choose which features you want installed.  For instance, I have no use for parental notifications, so I turned those off.  All of the different features can be installed or not installed depending on your preference.

The first thing I did on my PCs was run a scan for potential viruses/security issues.  I was previously running Norton and it must have done a good job because the scan found nothing suspicious.

I also installed the software on my Android phone.  The installation went smoothly and I chose my settings.  Then I went online to make sure the device locator was working and was happy to see that it had an accurate location for my phone.  Then, came the frustrating part.  Apparently, one of the settings added a little tab on the right hand side of my phone that shows alerts for various issues.  I tried going through every setting I could find to remove it.  I don't like the way it looks since it overlaps with apps.  I don't understand why these notices aren't put in the notice bar, like every other program.  To get rid of it temporarily, I was able to drag and drop it into a garbage bin.  Again, why not put this in a notification tray and allow me to swipe it away?  Dragging it up to a garbage can is awkward.  Of the two notifications I have receive so far, one was a warning about one of my apps not meeting their security standards and the other was asking if I wanted to close all of my open programs.  The first one made sense to me and I uninstalled that app.  The second one was just irritating.

I tried contacting McAfee through chat three times.  The first time, the screen just loaded forever.  The second time, the chat window wouldn't open.  The third time, the chat window opened, but after waiting for 6 minutes for a representative, I received a notice saying that a technician had ended my session.  I give up.  This is just too frustrating.  The software works well on my computers, but it's obvious the mobile device version needs work.

Norton SW has saved my machines, almost daily, certainly at least once a month, for years.  I just bought three more of these NSW 2006, as I couldn't find them before (now have 9 sets, and I think each license is good for up to 3 machines).  You can use the program from the CD, don't have to install it.  So test usage on your machine via the CD, first.

I love this program suite.  Been using this since my first Windows PC which someone had thrown into the trash, in the year 2000.  It was due to NSW 2000 that I was able to resurrect that PC's registry.  It was a Win95 machine which the owner (who didn't know how to wipe his hard drive) was trying to convert to Win98.  He couldn't do it, so trashed the machine.  A janitor named Jesus who knew me, decided he wanted to save the trashed machine for me.  Two weeks later, on my pastor's birthday or at least the first week of it (1st April), he found me and gave me that Micron machine.  So I've been using this program since 2000.

So obviously when NSW 2006 came along, me and my newly-purchased XP were glad to get it.  With this, you can rescue your machine from updates, from installations, from anything that goes on, using GoBack (I had GoBack already from Wildfile, but Norton purchased it.)  Atop that, are the myriad of utilities which Norton was long famous for in DOS and earlier Windows.  Plus, many utilities in the 'Optimizer' and 'Check It Diagnostics' that make Windows much easier to use.

Then there's One Button Checkup.  For Win98 machines, it's a godsend.  You can do just about anything to edit or fix your registry, because 'one button' only means AUTOMATING the process, versus the rest of the utilities, which can be manually or interactively run.  Seriously, if you still use Win98 you need this program.  Two big categories of registry fixes are for drive letters or folder location changes (i.e., if you move a program from one location to another), and for entries referring to uninstalled programs which you didn't install using Norton Clean Sweep.  The more such entries clog your registry, the slower Windows is to boot, and eventually it can't boot.  So cleaning the registry is vital.  But for most people, cleaning it seems daunting, and yes can be dangerous.  That's why this program is such a godsend.  I didn't even know anything about Windows when I got that trashed machine.  But thanks to Norton, I could learn quickly, and got it up and running.

Now for XP, this wonderful program which resurrected my Windows machine from Jesus in second review paragraph -- the XP version, is not as flexible and helpful.  But it's not bad.  It finds and fixes bad registry entries usually left behind due to program or Windows updates.  I still run it weekly on my XP machines (I now have five).  You always have 'undo', so if you changed something, you can undo the change and restore the machine as if your 'fix' never occurred.  It can no longer properly edit the registry.  But for that, you can get TuneUp Utilities 2011 and later, which has the same functions as Norton here, and many more.  (TuneUp doesn't have GoBack or virus programs, however.)

There have always been complaints about NSW since Symantec took them over.  I echo those complaints.  But the solution, is to never install the virus protection, and to turn off Live Update (which you are forced to install).  I learned to do that, early on.

Don't let the partially-bad stuff reported (generally correctly) keep you from buying this, if you are still on XP.  GoBack alone is worth several days' angst each time Windows update or some program update, crashes your machine.  Many people swear by it, so just look for the reviews, or Google on 'GoBack', see what folks are saying.  For me, it's a must-have.  It doesn't work with EASEUS or Acronis or Rebit, but DOES work with Macrium Reflect 5 Pro.

Seriously: I've used this program daily for 13 years.  GoBack in particular has saved Windows crashes so often, I've lost count.  You can turn it off and on, and yes when you do that there's a long wait, because GoBack deletes all its continuous snapshots it takes of your machine's operation.  But honey, when you have a crash, and GoBack boots pre Windows, it's the sweetest thing to literally TURN THE CLOCK BACK to the time when your machine was working.  In addition, you get to see all of what happened just prior to the crash, so you can tell WHY something went wrong.  (That's how you even know when to turn the clock back, GoBack keeps a continual log of computer operations.)

If by contrast you're on Windows 7 and want to know what is the next-best-thing, try TuneUp Utilities.  I reviewed TuneUp 2011 here in Amazon a year ago, and with it 2012 and 2013.  TuneUp does all the good stuff of Norton, except it has no GoBack (but MagiCure does, operating a bit differently, so too Macrium Reflect 5 Pro).  TuneUp has no anti-virus programs or utilities, so you don't have to worry about that. :)

I realize this review needs to be more specific about what these utilities are: but there are too many to list. Just put your questions as comments to this review.  Amazon emails me per comment, so I'll know, and come answer you.

Essentially, your PC needs a lot of housekeeping, and you probably dislike at least a few of Windows' defaults.  So unless you're willing to learn 'GodMode' in Windows (a secret Windows folder you create to access a table of contents for tweaking EVERYTHING in Windows, Google on the term), get this: and this, is safer.","Don't want to live without this, for XP and Win98",1387843200,,

This part written Dec 9, 2009 (see updated comments below)

This is of course a preliminary review (written Dec 9 based on use in the last few days). At this time one can't do more than a rough cut estimate of the tax return -- the IRS forms aren't finalized, the state forms aren't available, and of course the various income reports (W2, 1099, etc.) aren't out yet.

I don't have a super complicated tax situation this year: it just requires some things that a good tax program should handle easily. So far this program seems to do just fine. I found it easy to use, and found that imports from Quicken and from TXF files worked without any problems. Schedules A, B, and D worked just fine, and the related screens were easy to use and understand. Excess FICA was calculated correctly, as was the child tax credit. The AMT calculation does of course remain weirdly complicated (once a year I mutter to myself about all politicians in DC), but the program does take care of it with no apparent problems.

I used TaxCut last year -- chose it over TurboTax just because of cost, and was quite satisfied. I'm not convinced this year either that you get value for the extra you pay for TT. (Incidentally, note that if you have investment income you probably need to get TT Premium, so the price would be nearly double that of HRB Deluxe.)

A warning I wrote in my review last year seems worth repeating: Don't expect a tax program to apply tax laws correctly in all circumstances; for anything at all out of the ordinary, make sure you double-check against an IRS guide or another guide like JK Lasser's. The folks who design and write and test the programs make mistakes, too. And for the same reason, give the calculations a sanity check, don't just use the program blindly, or you could get tripped up by a software bug that wasn't caught.

I will update this review in Jan/Feb when I've had a chance to do more with it.

Update Jan 29, 2010:

I have now done a first complete pass on my taxes, based on W2s, 1099s, and some projected 1099s.  I also have had an opportunity to use TurboTax Deluxe (I got a free copy, legally), so have been able to compare the two products.

I continue to like HRB Deluxe.  It's easy to use, and has been trouble-free.  There are a couple of things I particularly like, that might be worth mentioning.  (1) They show you when the next update is expected, so you don't waste your time running the update check until there is something.  (2) Entering info from interest paying mutual funds that might have muni income (tax-free for Fed) is simple: HRB gives you a simple way to enter the amount that's tax-free in your state, and takes care of it without hassle.  TT can also deal with this, but I don't like their way as much (they create a separate 1099 to split the income into two parts).

Interestingly, TTD is also noticeably slower starting up than HRBD.  Don't know why.

The one advantage TT does have over HRB is on coverage of automated downloads: TT can download your 1099 info from a larger set of institutions than can HRB.  W2 downloads look the same between the two.  This does save some time, and could be sufficient to be a decider for some.  Not for me.",good product at a good price (updated),1260835200,121,

It is clear Corel does not care one bit for it's users and is interested in making money on a program, whether it works or not.  The new text tool could work if there was a user manual or the help files explained it properly.  As it is, the only way to apply text is by trial and error, a very frustrating experience.  I have been using this program since version 8 and it seems that they have gone out of their way to make it worse.  There is a project part of the program but there is no way to get photos into the project workspace.  It just doesn't function.  I wrote to Corel about this and they said they know it's a problem.  So it seems I've paid for a program they know doesn't work and have been really shafted by Corel.  The program is very new and already there is an update that so far fixes nothing.  What's wrong with a company that releases software that doesn't work and needs patches within weeks of release.

My experience is the complete opposite. I have a late model HP 17 inch laptop computer with a 64 bit Intel chip, an eMachines computer with a 32/64 bit AMD processor and a home built Intel i7 64 bit system with a Gigabyte Extreme motherboard. I have Windows 7 running on all my computers all 64 bit except for the eMachines computer. I have never encountered even one problem installing or using PowerDVD 10 or 11. Now I do maintain my computer and regularly do registry cleans and run the disk cleaner application. But everybody should be doing that routinely anyway. I even have Intel solid state disks on my laptop computer and my Intel i7 computer. All I can say is I've never encountered any problem whatsoever. I've even used it with yet another AMD Vista 64 bit computer in China. Never had a problem. And I do test and try out all the various options, too. I use the HDMI output on my XFX video card as an input to my 65 inch Panasonic HDTV. Works great. The claim that they can change the resolution to HD is sort of a marketing joke. Garbage in, ever so slightly better garbage out. If your video was shot in the 1980's, nothing is going to make them look like it was shot in HD. It just doesn't work that way. This is marketing hype, technically accurate statement, but still chiefly hype.

My main complaint is that Cyberlink creates a new version out of trivial improvements, such as from Version 10 to 11. There just isn't that much of an incremental change to warrant two different versions.  And the upgrade price is just way too expensive, especially considering how little difference there is. We will be at version 99 soon at this pace. They should give the updates away free like Microsoft does. And this is much more of an update and tweak than a version change. In my opinion Cyberlink is price gouging just because they can. They have the only truly functional Blu-ray DVD player. If there were credible competition, the price would drop like a rock.  There is competition, but they aren't exactly cheap either.  Cyberlink should offer a family plan where you can use the software on multiple home computers.  I have four legal copies and it is just not right to pay for each one when I am only using one computer at a time.  Instead, I have to pay for each computer.

I have used photoshop every day for 14 years for both creating graphics and for doing post production on photographs. So many times I have seen work produced by other photographers that has extra elements added in post production that has a sci-fi or fantasy feel to the image.  I never knew how this was accomplished.

Corel Painter 2015 not only allows me to accomplish this, but also to create a completely new style for my work.

The ability to create psd files and go back and forward between Painter and Photoshop is such a major win since the file will retain all quality (because it is not compressed to a different format) and it will retain the layers.

Even if this only came with airbrushes, it would be a great tool in anyones studio.

I'm a writer, and although my spelling and typing are pretty good, I've been using Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium for the PC for years. It reads back what I wrote, which helps me catch typos and repeated words that my eyes alone might miss. Over the years, it's gotten better and better.

My dyslexic husband, though, prefers to work on our Mac, and he prefers to have me handle his editing needs. After all, what's the point of being married to a writer if you can't have her check your spelling, grammar, punctuation, and general writing style? He has an iPhone, too, and I've seen him struggle with Siri, whose voice recognition capabilities are a joke compared to my Android's.  So I got this software for him, because... Well, I'm tired of doing something for him when he should be able to do it himself, with the help of a little software.

Dragon Dictate for the Mac is a lot better than Siri at recognizing his voice. There's no question about that. But it doesn't hold a candle to the latest version of Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium that I'm using on my PC. To be honest, part of it does seem to be, well, him. My husband just can't seem to find a voice-recognition program that understands him. I mean, I tried Dragon Dictate, and it seemed to work okay, though not great. I'd say the accuracy with a good headset was about 92%. (By comparison, I'd give Siri a 40% and DNS Premium for the PC a 98%). For him, though, the accuracy was more like 75% with Dictate and maybe 80% with DNS Premium. Maybe it's his English accent. Maybe it's that he sort of starts and stops when he speaks. Maybe it's that he doesn't speak at an even level. I don't know. So he's decided to stick with his old system, meaning me. None of us want to be replaced by computers, but when it comes to some things... It would have been nice. I could have spent more time on my own writing.

So I like Dragon Dictate for the Mac. It's head and shoulders above the competition when it comes to voice recognition for the Mac. But I don't love it the way I love DNS Premium for the PC.

When I got it, I was thinking it would be just like the Windows edition, just with the traffic light buttons at the top.  I love how everything is floating (not constrained in a Windows; you have toolbar at top, tasks in the middle, and any other items float on the desktop), this is great for when you need to open other files and still view QuickBooks, since you can put the windows side by side and still see both documents (for example copying a contact from the address book to Customer List is simple since the two small windows can sit right by each other and you can just copy and paste each item).  The next great thing is the installation, like many Mac apps it was simply a drag and drop to the application folder and it was installed.  I then was able to activate with the License and Product number and register online, super simple (took about 2 minutes).  The software was easy to set up (I have used QuickBooks for Windows in the past and am familiar with the software), my only flaw is that the first time I used it closed (red exit) on the Company Home Page and the toolbar trying to close QB, but then found I had to Quit from the Dock (or Menu), when I reopened QB, nothing was their and I had to go to Company >> Company Home, and Show Company Toolbar to get it -- Just FYI, I learned that I need to Quit from the Dock or the Menu.  The program opens very quick on my computer (I am using Mac OS X Lion [10.7.2]) and I love the number indicator lights on my items to show me what I have out their at a glance (for example a red number on Invoice to show how many open invoices I have [like on the Mail App for New Mail]).  I was able to set up my accounts with just the Default settings for my industry and was able to create my item list and Customer list very easily, the Help >> Search section is great since if you are looking for a list or setting you can type it in and it will find it for you (and show you where in the menu it is, and you can open it from their).  In the box their was a paper to show you how to import Windows based QuickBooks files, however, since I used to use Simple Start (Free for Windows), I created a new company, since I wanted the full settings from the start.

Another point I want to show, is how much of an improvement the look and feel of the software is.  I love how I can view my invoices or payments or estimates just by using the info on the left and then I can scroll through them flawlessly and view live information on the invoice or go into Preview Mode and scroll through each invoice without having to open Print Preview, as well as see quick info on the customer (like Customer Info and recent transactions!).  This software has such a genuine feel to it, which just makes it perfect!  I can see everything of my business in a quick glance without having to go through lists of information and then opening and closing widows till I find the one, this is an amazing edition of QuickBooks and is just perfect for me as a freelancer!

I also want to add how great support for QuickBooks programs are!  I use QuickBooks POS at work and had the best experience setting it up with the help of our representative and the online community.  Just as I am seeing on this product with the number of Manufacture Replies, I am seeing great customer service who is trying to help customers at every point of the experience.  I have used phone support and online support for my Intuit products in the past and have never had a bad experience.  I am glad to see the Manufacture comments on other reviewers, as that shows me that Intuit is ensuring that their products are working properly and are listening to customer feedback!  And just like our POS system I know if I need help their is entire community of Intuit product users who can help me just by me posting a question or finding others with the same inquiry.

In the end this is great software for keeping up with your business, it allows me to keep track of my freelancing and easily manage my money flow, and all from my Mac!

I have been using it for years to do my taxes and it has made it relatively painless.  Up until now, if you purchase the Deluxe version you get free Federal e-file, because the IRS does not charge for this service.  Remember when they did?  TurboTax used to charge a fee.  But, now they don't because the IRS doesn't.

So, the State of California sent out notices this year saying that they have free e-filing.  I assumed that when I did an automatic upload of any changes to the taxes this year that TurboTax would also upload the fact that the State of California has free e-filing.  However, they still charge an extra $20 for e-filing the State return.  I looked at their community question and answer sections
, and it appears that many states now offer free e-filing, and other tax payers also assumeD that meant TurboTax would file their state return for free.  However, TurboTax just takes the $20 out of your tax refund.

So, if they don't change things next year, without increasing the price on their software, I will no longer be purchasing TurboTax.  If I have to fill out the same information a second time on the State of California tax website, why do I need TurboTax?

In the ""old"" days, either Windows would corrupt your drive or, the inevitable, a drive would fail after about 3 years.  Now, it seems to me that drive failure is the biggest problem.  It WILL fail, you just don't know when.

I don't bother backing up just ""critical"" folders.  I ""image"" the entire drive once a week.  Sure, you can save your folders and data, but a large concern is getting your OS and software back to where it was.  Nowadays, you don't even have a disc, you download from online.  So, getting your software back is problematic and time consuming.  Along the way, there are the updates that you don't have even if you have a disc.

So, I ""image"".  I used to image to a second drive in my ""tower"".  Now that I have a laptop, I image to an external hard drive.  This takes six or seven hours but is not a problem if you do it at night.  Just when things look stable, Acronis comes out with a yearly update.  Being stupid and cheap, I usually upgrade to the newest version for a reduced price.

Whatever the reason, every version of Acronis comes with a new ""GUI"" that you have to learn as well as installation problems and bugs that take a year to resolve.  I now understand that you're going to have to pay yearly ""license renewal"" fees for a lot of things.  It's simply ""cost versus benefit"", like antivirus software.  If I didn't absolutely need Acronis or something similar, I wouldn't buy it.  But, I haven't really found anything else I trust yet.

Things started to go to hell again in 2011.  I ordered 2012 but it would not install.  Okay, so I'm still able to backup.  Then, 2011 got corrupted and would not run.  Since my copy of 2011 was a result of several yearly upgrades, it would not have been easy to re-install and work my way back.  So, I went to Amazon and purchased a full copy of 2011.  That worked fine until I upgraded to W8.  Remind me again to write ""I will never be a first adopter again"" on the blackboard 50,000 times!  W8 didn't like 2011 (and several other programs).

Okay, I'll pay.  I downloaded the trial version of Acronis 2013.  But, it wouldn't install!  Without going into detail, it didn't like the fact that I had Seagate ""DiscWizard"" installed.  Guess what, Acronis WROTE DiscWizard but couldn't uninstall it!  So, after much screwing around and communication with support, I was able to install 2013 and image.

Because of comments from another, I think I'm going to buy several drives that fit my laptop and ""clone"" my C drive rather than image.  Replacing a drive in your laptop may be a challenge for some but maybe, it would be quicker and more reliable.  I have already done it when one failed.

In conclusion, I hate the yearly change in the Acronis GUI.  I don't use any of the features they have except for imaging (cloning), but I have to have this or something like it.  I can't say that I have done an exhaustive search, but other backup programs that do imaging don't let you ""mount"" the image as Acronis does.  This way, you can look at a few files to get some confidence that the backup is intact.  So, again, after many years, I'm going to trust the devil I know.

Edited a few days later after I successfully cloned my C: drive.  I ""bumped"" the stars up to 4 because cloning worked and was much faster than imaging.  I had been imaging to a 1 terabyte, 3.5"" drive externally using a Thermaltake ""BlacX"" SATA USB docking station.  With the terabyte drive, I was able to save at least 3 images.  But, I never realized that by having all images on the same drive I would lose all if the drive failed.  Since the ""BlacX"" docking station also accommodates 2.5"" drives, like the one in my laptop, I ordered a drive like the 500 gig drive used in my ACER laptop.

I cloned to this new drive which took only about 2 hours instead of 6 for imaging.  Also, after the cloning, you can look directly at the drive by using ""my computer"" without ""mounting"" it like you have to do with an image.  So, a little time savings.  Just to be sure, I popped open my laptop and swapped the C: drive for the newly cloned one.  Everything worked perfectly.  My plan is to buy another drive so that I can rotate cloning the two drives and always have two backup drives.  Now, it would take three drive failures, the original C: plus the two clones, before I lose everything.  Cost-wise, the cost of two 2 500 gig clone drives is about the same as the single 1 terabyte drive I was using for imaging.

Jeanclerc,"The current trend for software companies is to provide ""software as a service"" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time.  There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.

Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.

In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).",Yep - You're Renting Office Now - Get Used to It!,1381968000,,

The program has traditionally cost me about $20 (I buy basic), and then I efile, so my cost in the last few years was $35. Amazon is currently selling this for $30, so I'll save $5.

If I was someone who did multiple efiles then I might feel differently, but for me, this is a positive. I'm not naive, I can see where people might have issues with this due to situation. That I don't have a problem with.

However, a lot of the complaints I'm reading here are from people who seem to like to complain.  God help you if you have a positive opinion about something, you get branded stupid, your opinion is invalid. It seems that the only way you can be accepted anymore on the Internet is to have a negative opinion. Sigh.

Edit: Since I posted this review, I saw some additional text go up on the product description for TurboTax.  This text reads ""FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product.""  This was not part of my original review, and it seems to imply Intuit has backed off some of the initial E filing limits.

But Old Faithful needed more help.  It really needed reformatting, which is why the newer computer was loaded. Before bothering to reformat, though, I thought I'd see what Norton 360 could do to speed it up.

I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton.  That was six weeks ago and I haven't felt the need to go to the bother of reformatting.

Norton cleaned Old Faithful and offers all sorts of advice and help to allow you to safely speed things up.  The program, while still resource-heavy while running, is much slicker than it used to be, faster than AVG's Security Suite, and, well. . . It was taking this computer five minutes to boot up before.  Now it's up in a minute.

I would not consider this to be a product on the level of Adobe Premiere. Granted, that should be something of a no-brainer, but it helps to have proper expectations. As reasonably-robust video-editing software at a fair price, Nero 2014 works well. The Blu-Ray viewer works wonderfully, saving the need to purchase other stand-alone software. The burning process has, in my experience, worked flawlessly. I don't have any coasters, but I can't say I've burned more than a handful. The video-editing software is lacking, but when I compare it to Apple offerings such as iMovie, I find it's up to the task of creating basic home movies.

The Suite is fairly robust, covering all the basic needs of this decidedly amateur video-editor. I have no doubt someone with most extensive experience in this field would find Nero 2104 to be a limitation, but for the ""average Joe"" looking to spend something less than a fortune, Nero continues to deliver.

Nuisance (oops, nuance) has NO fallback for those times you must do a clean install on your OS,
(AND are unable to access your OS in order to UNinstall their product ""Prior to"" the OS reinstall).

------------------------------------------
Update 11-01-2009  Be forewarned about activation & loss of product usage.

------------------------------------------
Attention !!!! WARNING !!!!

Nuance does things a lot different with their product's installation & activation.
A couple re-installs of your windows operating system due to windows issues; and/or a couple hardware upgrades like new video card or new hard drive, and PDF converter 5 could cease to function.

My installation had this problem recently.
At almost (...), you expect a program to function 24/7/365.
When mine stopped working, it really interrupted my work production.

So,
If you have this software installed and want to upgrade/changed ANY internal PC hardware, you MUST uninstall the pdf converter pro 5 software
""BEFORE you make ANY hardware changes"" !!!

NOTE: UNinstalling the program in effect ""DE-activates"" your pdf converter pro 5.
Thus ""releaseing"" the license key and this doesn't count against your
""5 license activations"", before product QUITS working!

I work with pc hardware and do pc repairs/upgrades 40+ hours a week.

On my work PC, I have upgraded my mobo 3 times this year. My hard drive twice.
(one of the perks of being the IT helpdesk guy) (last update was to an Intel i7 Core.)

Recently I had lost windows booting abilities, so I installed a newer, larger, hard drive.
So I installed the brand new hard drive and did a clean XP Pro installation.

As soon as I loaded PDF Converter 5 Pro, it wanted to activate.

Then it went online a few seconds and then an error window popped up saying I had exceeded the 5 activation allowances that Nuance allows.

I emailed Nuance the details.
I mentioned how I own 4 retail box copies of this s/w.

After going back and forth with support, they re-activated my license number.

But I could not make PDF files or about 2 days.

*****How to prevent this from happening again?****

If you are using PDF converter 5 on your PC, then ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS
do an UNinstall before changing ANY pc hardware.

The activation process takes serial numbers from the internal components and uses them for activation calculations. (probably the serial # of mobo and/or hard drives).

When a serial number changes due to new hardware, the s/w launches another activation attempt.
Five activations are allowed before the s/w is disabled.

You MUST UNistall the software before doing hardware upgrades, to keep the activation counter from decrementing one of the 5 activation allowances.

This is the sort of thing that should be listed on a neon colored label, on the CD's paper sleeve or jewel case. And/or on the box it comes in.
I told Nuance this, but I doubt they'll do anything about it.

Unforunately, it is not like there are a lot of choices for the
combination software of PDF maker with a PDF converters.

You have:
1. Nuance pdf conveter pro 5
2. Nitro pdf.
3. PDF tools [by solid documents]

Adobe's acrobat pdf maker is pricey and has no conversion abilities. It only creates PDFss.

Other single function s/w conveters are:

Able2extract
Docudesk
PDF conveter elite

Oh, and as far as product functionality, this software does okay.

PDF to word conversions do okay with text; but sort of crappy with images.
(But it seems to be this way with all pdf converter applications).

------------------------------------------------------------
I'm on day 1 of using this software.

Creating a PDF is working fine.

Converting an existing PDF to MS Word is working fine, so far.

Converting an existing PDF with a table inside it; into MS excel is working OK, so far.

Annoyances/problems:

1. After installing software onto my PC, an annoying ""activation"" NAG screen keeps popping up everytime/anytime I launch the program and/or toggle between CREATING a PDF vs CONVERTING a PDF.
Plus it decrements from 30 uses to none.

So off I went to ACTIVATE this whiner!

2. Activation:

a. I just went online, registered,  and then activated it, but apparently it requires further  MANUAL intervention by the enduser (lazy programmers at Nuance).
Because I am still getting the pop-up about not being activated.

b. License key & activation problems:
The setup/installation onto your PC works just fine with numbers and LOWER case letters . [For entering the alpha-numeric license code during installation of the software onto your PC].

But as soon as you get to Nuance's website and try to activate/register,
by using their ""Paste-serial-number-from-clipboard"" button, you get an error!
These boneheads keep kicking back your serial number as INCORRECT until you make it ONLY numbers and only ""UPPER case"" letters.
(why doesn't Nuance spend  a couple bucks on a 5 minute programming ""FIX""  and let the stinking webpage AUTO correct a small issue like these)

Next, trying to correct a serial number which was already ""pasted"" into the Nuance webform box [but contained lower-case letters]. Whenever I'd click my mouse next to a lower case letter and try to CHANGE it to an UPPERcase letter, a wretched pop-up window keeps WHINING about using ""The PASTE button function only"".
For every 1 lower-case letter you try to change to upper-case; you have to answer 2 pop-up windows and make them go away.
[Hey tightwads, fix your website's serial number entry form).
[Go to Elance and hire a programmer for (...) an hour and FIX the problem with ""YOUR"" [NUANCE's] website]

I tried to be  nice  and contact Nuisance (whoops, I mean Nuance) about their problem.
(Starting off an end-user experience like this is NOT going to endear me to rush out and buy any more NUANCE products; especially  if they can't make the registration & activation process easier, functional and more streamlined)

Here's a frustrating experience; Just try contacting these Tight-fisted pukes with a simple FYI, to tell them about a website issue of their's.

These pukes  expect you to shell out (...) per incident  just to contact them.
Sorry dudes, I'm not paying to fix YOUR website problems.

SUMMARY:

Pros - products looks/acts OK so far.
  - cheaper than Adobe

Cons - Just hope you NEVER need to contact NUANCE for ANYTHING.
Or I should say; PLAN to NEVER contact them.
[you can't even throw them a bone about how to improve their website without getting hit up for (...)]
 -poor activation web setup
 - Deceptive/hidden cost details about tech support :
  - no mention on software box
  - no mention inside box, nor in User manual

I bought this program for myself.
Once I test-drove it awhile, I was going to make recommendations to a large client about maybe switching to Nuance (from Adobe).
I really have my doubts now; especially regarding their ""nickel & dime-ing"" attitude toward their end-users.

QuickBooks has the small business accounting software market almost to itself, although mostly on Windows.  Apple's market share in computing significantly increased during my hiatus and there has been a shift towards the internet, mobile devices and, more recently, the cloud.  Whether QuickBooks will fully embrace these changes has yet to be seen.  Intuit provides more services to small businesses than it used to and it is even teaming up with Bank of America to integrate software and financial services, although whether that will benefit small business owners, it is also too soon to know.

The basic software seems to be the same with tweaks and incremental improvements rather than a complete rebuild from the ground up.  It still doesn't do everything for everyone but it will allow the majority of small businesses owners to take care of most of the day-to-day bookkeeping and allow an accountant to use the files to submit a tax return, and at a very reasonable cost compared to what this would have cost just a few decades ago.

Some of the newer features are being able to have multiple users with access restricted only to certain functions such as payroll, tracking project time and expenses and billing them to clients, and exporting report data to Microsoft Excel.  Incredibly, batched importing of online banking transactions is new for 2012.  The overall look and feel has also been improved for Mac users.

Still, the Mac version does not have all the capabilities and features of the Windows version and it doesn't seem that this will change.  Apple computers can now run Windows and Windows-compatible software and the two operating systems have also become more similar.  So for most small business owners with Apple computers, the real question is not whether to use QuickBooks but whether to use the Windows or Mac version.  Ironically, at a time when Apple operating systems are gaining market share, starting out on or switching over to QuickBooks for Windows is now a much better option for Mac users than it ever has been.",Incremental improvements,1320537600,13,

There is a new format this year and I'm not quite sure I like it.  It could be that I'm use to the old format.  However, the program still takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.

I tried Taxcut in the past because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).

I have to agree that the advertising included in the product (for more Intuit products) now borders on the ridiculous and the program (like all programs) needs more space and more resources each year but I still think that is better that the competition.

And I had to learn Word, Excel, and Power Point etc.  And while Microsoft Office is the standard, and you find it almost everywhere, I find myself missing WordPerfect and the other programs often.
WordPerfect is still and amazingly powerful word processor.  It may not look as pretty as Word, but it has a lot less hiccups and once you learn the basic workings it makes it much easier to format documents then Word.  Word in all its wisdom to try and figure out what it is you are trying to do does a lot of auto-formatting and getting it to stop can be tough, WordPerfect makes that much easier and much more straight forward, I imagine that is one reason it is so like by the legal profession.
Quattro Pro has all the processing power of Excel in my opinion, pretty much every function you have in Excel you have in QP.

With the introduction of SP2 in this minor update of Windows XP, Microsoft has decided to make the product ""secure"", than it was thought to be in the beginning. But the past few years have been rough on Microsoft, with consistency in attacks on the product with such vulnerabilities as Trojans, buffer overflows, viruses and the most memorable of the all Blaster (August 2003).

Ever since its debut, Windows XP has been causing a lot of headaches and wreaking havoc on corporate networks because of its susceptibility vulnerabilities that were not fixed in its initial release or Service Pack 1. So Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and decided to rethink what Windows XP should mean in terms of Security. At first Service Pack 2 was thought out to only be a minor Service Pack update with usual bug fixes, but because of the aforementioned problems Microsoft took new direction and after 1 year of testing we have finally reached a conclusion.

SP2 is really apparent, based on my experience of installing the update, users displayed a welcome screen recommending Automatic Updates be turned on (and I would recommend too), after which the user is presented with the Security Center where you can configure the new and improved Firewall settings, such as which programs can access your PC. You also have the option of configuring your Anti-Virus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Anti-virus is not supported, although it seems (Norton Anti-virus Corporate Edition 7.6). Security Center is really the big change here and should have been implemented from beginning, but better late than never.

Other great features which I and many users are undoubtedly thankful for include the Pop-Blocker which should have been included in IE 6 from the beginning (better late than never), its not 100 % percent effective but does a decent job so far of blocking most annoying Pop-Ups. I wish the Windows Team allowed users to train it, so if a Pop does succeed, you can tell the pop-up blocker engine that was a pop-up window and you shouldn't let that pass the next time, maybe Microsoft will let it improve over time. Other great improvements to IE in SP2 is the ability approve programs, so drive by downloads have become a thing of the past, anything you decide to download or accidentally clicked on a webpage has to be approved.

Another wish is, better integration of the ActiveX controls with Microsoft's own technologies, I notice that when I had to do a Office Update, the ActiveX API engine on Microsoft's Office website had to be approved before I run the utility that checked for updates for Office products I needed.

Microsoft has also streamlined Windows Update to be more user-friendly, you the user have the option for a Express or Custom install, Express only installs the most critical updates, while Custom allows to install the entire kitchen sink, including stuff some users can do without on Windows, (go with Express). Windows XP SP2 includes minor enhancements such as Windows Media Player 9, but why didn't Microsoft just wait a little longer and included Windows Media Player 10, which is already out? The blue tooth update is also a needed update, it wasn't intuitive right out of the box, but is more user friendly, all this, you can get for free if you are existing XP owner.

Overall, if you haven't upgraded to Windows XP yet from older versions of Windows, this is the time, but if you are an existing Windows XP user, I say skip this and just order the SP2 CD or download it from the Windows XP Website. I highly recommend users running prior versions of XP especially 95, 98, 98 SE, NT 4 and ME, maybe 2000 also move to XP, since Microsoft is planning on porting any of technologies in XP to those older versions of Windows, plus it has some great new features and you will love the Security technologies that provide a better experience for you the user.

You can also remove unintended objects (or offending ex-husbands) quickly and easily while still preserving your photo.

My favorite feature is the People Beautifier. It has a Tooth Brush which lets you easily whiten teeth in a photo, an Eye Blinger which whitens and brightens eyes and enhances eyelashes and eyebrows, a Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover, and a Body Shaper which lets you instantly lose weight and redistribute what's left! Seriously, these tools all work beautifully but are subtle enough that you won't end up looking like a caricature.

My only complaint is, like with lots of powerful programs these days, the documentation leaves something to be desired. There is a basic users manual included in the box and it will certainly get you started. But the many nuances of this program are not covered. Still, if you spend some time playing around with PhotoDirector, you'll discover just how many things you can do with it and how easy it is to use.

10027,3,False,"12 16, 2014",A1YAGM2QOSAAOT,B00N4OLGP2,{'Platform:': ' PC Disk'},Personal Robot,"I use Premiere Pro and After Effects professionally and I state that upfront to make it clear that my expectations of PowerDirector are much lower. I expect something along the lines of Apple's iMovie, and hopefully better.

I installed this on one of my Windows 8.1 computers, an Asus laptop with a 17"" screen, 8gb RAM, and a 1.83gHz Baytrail-M processor. A speed demon this is not, and its lack of a dedicated video card seriously slows down video processing. With that in mind, it's still hard not to get frustrated when PowerDirector lags and freezes, but keeping expectations in check, I find I am more annoyed with odd little bugs that happened frequently. The worst of these bugs was the play head, and accompanying video, jumping to the end of the video timeline while the audio played where it should be. This happened over and over while editing a video, making it impossible to preview effects and transitions.

But onto the good: PowerDirector keeps things pretty simple. Import your video, then click to select and drag the clips you want onto the timeline. Once there, video is easily trimmed simply by dragging from either end of the clip to shorten the video. Place the playhead where you want to cut a video and click ""Split."" The result is two pieces of the same video that can be moved or deleted independently.

I was initially a little thrown off once I'd trimmed my video to the needed lengths: where are all the video and audio editing tools? Turns out they're hidden away, sort of. Select a video and you'll note a banner of buttons appears above the timeline section. Most notable is the Fix/Enhance. Select this and what I was looking for is here - color correction, lighting adjustments, white balance, and stabilization. Each of these gives you deeper control over the image, but, at least on my computer, they can be slow to apply (and un-apply in order to see the difference.) Here is where Premiere shines - each effect has its own on-off switch while PowerDirector only toggles all of the changes made in a given section. It's not the worst thing, but it does make things just a tad more frustrating.

Stabilization is handled quite well, correcting a very wobbly bit of video with very little of the sloshy effect that stabilization can have.

There are transitions galore, from the basic fade to 3D. Select one, drag it down to the point that it needs to be utilized - and this is much more fiddly than I've experienced before. It needs to be placed right at the very beginning or end to snap into place. Anywhere else and you have to go back and reselect it. There is very little forgiveness when it comes to placing transitions in PowerDirector. Zooming in on the timeline using the slider in the lower left of the program may help with this.

Exporting your video is done through the Produce pane, and you are offered a plethora of choices here. Many different formats and settings for each one. This could be overwhelming for a new user. PowerDirector defaulted back to the original file format here, why I don't know - I don't want it back in a format for the camera. Also available here are direct uploads to favorite video hosting sites - YouTube, Vimeo, etc. I simply exported my video as mp4, and a 12-minute video is going to need a bit over 2 hours to render.

I wouldn't choose PowerDirector over Premiere, but at home, for simple video editing, it's a decent enough program. Apple iMovie keeps things simpler, but PowerDirector offers more options, but it's pretty close in approach. Were the choice up to me, I'd probably choose Premiere Elements because not only does it have a familiar interface for me, there is a lot more online user support for Premiere than PowerDirector. Sometimes being able to easily track down help makes all the difference.","iMovie for the PC, basically.",1418688000,2,

Those who are ripping this software as 'terrible' or 'unusable' as being overly harsh. Does it have some frustrating issues? Sure. Is it worthless and unusable? Not at all.

Word, which is the application I spent about half my work hours using, is in many cases easier to use in the 2007 version. While I'm not a huge fan of the ribbon, I don't have issues locating what I need nor do I have problems customizing it to include the features I use most often. Overall I can find exactly what I need when I need it. I think most of the complaints that I read about the ribbon have more to do with users unable to adapt than with a real design flaw inherent to the system of organization. The new DocX file format creates smaller file sizes than the old standard, but at the expense of versatility, as un-patched versions of Microsoft Word will not open them.

Excel is fantastic. The 2007 version is impressively fast compared to 2003. I can use tilt tables with 200 variables without a second delay. Also, the ability to create very high quality charts and graphs that seamlessly integrate with Power Point and Word is fantastic. I've been able to make nicer looking reports in less time than ever before. Excel is the biggest overall improvement from 2003 especially in the visual department. The addition of a wide variety of visual styles for reports is welcome and very useful.

Another great change to Excel is the detailed descriptions for each command that are available in the help section. There is still some streamlining that is missing; too much of the program is still dependent on old macro commands that no one but long time users of things like Lotus Notes have a vocabulary for.

Power Point is also a nice improvement. Adding images and then tweaking them is easier than ever. As I mentioned previously, taking charts and graphs from Excel to PP is very easy. You can use cut-and-paste, or import them directly. The resulting PP files are also smaller than the previous format, which is great for e-mailing them to people.

The much maligned DocX format was initially a real gaffe for Microsoft; not making it immediately usable by Office 2003 users was simply moronic. Although they've released several patches that do allow full implementation between 2003 and 2007 versions of Office, these updates are large (over 50mb) and while businesses most certainly have updated, it's far less likely that your friend, brother, etc., has. Sending a DocX file to those without the patch can create a bit of chaos.

Overall Office 2007 is an improvement over 2003, even if you hate the ribbon. The speed increases, added features, and integration of excel, word, and PP in a way that lets them all play together nicely is well worth the upgrade.",Better than negative reviews would have you believe,1235433600,2,

Within the past few years there have been a number of new products on the market, a good thing as I had begun to despair at Norton and McAfee products as overly controlling, system hogs.

My criteria for a security product is that it shield me from hazards (lately that needs to include websites known for attacks). That it catch viruses and generally guard my system from intrusion while I'm not looking. I, also, require that it be open to adjustment and customization beyond the standard settings and that it load quickly and maintain a minimum footprint on my system so that it runs in the background without my taking notice for the majority of the time.

This product does most of this. It is a bit more intrusive than past Kaspersky products but not as much so that I replaced it within a few days like my last experience with Norton. It is not as light on my system resources as Viper, but again not so much that I feel the need to replace it.

Ultimately, it does its job and only every once in a while makes me think it is a tad too heavy on my system resources (especially on my netbook). That said I may be leaning toward replacing it with Bit Defender before long, as that one seems somewhat lighter on the minimal system resources on my netbook.

It was cutting-edge then.

I had high hopes that Dictate 4.0 would finally be the product that Dictate 3.0 wanted to be but, sadly, it isn't.  The bugs are still there in terms of dictating in MS Word, and I haven't even gotten to ""command"" mode yet.

While the accuracy of capturing your speaking voice is better than previous versions, making changes in Word is still not fluid like it should be, and the accuracy of where the cursor goes leaves a lot to be desired.

When dictating into the text box that pops up when you start the program, the accuracy of dictation and making changes is quite good, as is dictating into Apple Pages.  I ended up dictating into the text box, then copying and pasting, and ultimately formatting in Word.  Ugh.  Hardly an elegant solution.

The one feature that is working fine is the transcribe feature, which I find I use more than anything in Dictate.  Transcribing voice recordings I've made on my iPhone, and also transcribing podcasts has really worked well.  Of course, I go in and manually edit afterwards because transcription doesn't know where all the punctuation belongs, etc.

I would say that if you're looking for a way to dictate a book you're writing and are satisfied to capture your thoughts, and edit later, this is a safe bet.  Even if you want to dictate the occasional email, etc., and it doesn't involve Word, then I'd recommend it.

The biggest changes for me is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.

Norton Security Premium comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

The cloud backup is something use for non-sensitive information only as backup. The identity protection and contact sharing is interesting but are not features I choose to use.

Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.

Windows Setup (UPDATED):
If you are using this to try to renew, DON'T follow the directions to activate the product at norton.com/setup. Instead login to your control panel and select renew. Select the option that lets you enter a key you already have (this one). Enter the key and if it is compatible with the version you are renewing this key will supersede the expiring key. One caution: wait till the old one is about to expire before plugging in the key so you don't lose your remaining subscription!

IF you followed the activation directions this will be installed as a separate product subscription and you will need to do the following:

**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you may need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices).

Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Premium very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 10 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security with Backup. I did have to restart my computer.

I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security with Backup reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.

The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security with Backup.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be ""noisy"" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has two features: anti-theft and cloud backup. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

It has cloud backup (doesn't Apple offer this too?) to backup your contacts and share them.

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:
If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed and want this to be a renewal, DON'T FOLLOW THE ACTIVATION DIRECTIONS!

If you have gone through norton.com/setup, be sure to remove your device from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying

If you have any plans to edit wave patterns in Spin Doctor, for example, don't expect anything close to precision--in fact, they're unreadable (darn pretty, though), and there's no indication that Roxio has addressed this problem in Toast 9. I've had to purchase both Sound Studio and WireTap Studio to to be able to get precisely edited program material for Public Radio broadcast.

Finally, if you're counting on the rebate, better photocopy and authenticate each and every step in the process, and be prepared to spend additional time afterwards calling the company about the missing rebate.  I must have spent over an hour taking pains to follow the instructions to the letter because I was keenly aware of the ""gotcha mentality"" from previous experience, But the proof from the original carton was insufficient to convince Roxio to reimburse me the twenty dollars for upgrading from Toast 6 to Toast 8.

Fluenz just provided this f2 update to those of us that purchased the original.  I've since gone through the first two disks.  Most of my original issues with editing inconsistencies and poor dubbing have been fixed (though, there's still one typo in the first disc that won't accept the correct answer), and now they show you what's in each session and where you left off. Other than those items, everything else in my original review still applies.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I investigated a lot of ""Learn Spanish"" programs before purchasing this one.  I took all of the free demo and sample classes available from each of those I investigated before making my final decision to purchase Fluenz.

The two I ultimately decided I liked best were this one, and Rocket Spanish.  For those doing their own comparisons, here's why I chose Fluenz and the upsides, downsides and tips I've found in using it, as well as whether I think it's worth the money:

ROCKET SPANISH VS. FLUENZ:
Rocket Spanish is much cheaper and operates very similiarly.  You can take a free weeks worth of courses to see how you like it. Like Fluenz, there's a bite size conversation in each class that an instructor walks you through (though it's all done verbally, no graphics).  Rocket conversation classes are interspersed with grammar classes. They can be downloaded to your ipod, and they have a pretty good internet support system.

However, what is lacking with Rocket is the ""game like"" interactive exercises that reinforce your learning and help you form the building blocks you really need to speak it well, that Fluenz provides so abundantly.  Ultimately, I ended up choosing Fluenz because I wanted to be sure (after having previously bought some very dull french programs I couldn't force myself to stick with)that it would engage me enough to want to keep at it each day, and give me conversational skills I could use immediately. Fluenz delivers upon this well!

FLUENZ UPSIDES:
- As easy and engaging as playing a computer game: Works fine on my memory-challenged vista computer. (Sonya, the instructor, does some weird speaking where her mouth doesn't line up with what she's saying during introductions - but fortunately that doesn't happen when she's actually teaching the classes).

- Built for adults with a focus on getting you to be able to do the fundamentals well! Challenging short exercises that move quickly from one to another.

- Lots of repetition and review of previous material built into engaging interactive exercises that make you constantly improve your pronunciation, writing and memorization of the material.

- Pretty much everything you need for a trip to Cabo or Tijuana, you'll learn in Spanish 1: Spanish 1 is perfect for someone who has never had any spanish.  It covers greetings, estar/ser verbs, geneder agreement,  basic conversational needs for restaurants, airports, shopping, taxis and getting around.  It also covers telling time and numbers from 1-999,999.

- By the end of Spanish 2, you'll be able to hold a pretty good conversation if you practice with real folks enough: Spanish 2 takes you into simple past tense, more complicated phrases, and for some reason,  they hold off teaching you the more familiar form of ""you"" until here.

- Helpful accompanying CD's: CD's that can be loaded on your MP3 Player supplement the classes and are a great way to practice pronunciation. They also often provide a more structured approach to verbs and other issues.

- ""The record it, then listen to how it should be pronounced"" exercises have been helpful. It's given me more confidence to speak to people.  I bought a $9 mic when I bought this - and it works just fine for the purpose.

FLUENZ DOWNSIDES:
- Could use a better supplement book:
Arrives in a huge box with expensive packaging and glossy fluenz brochures that don't really say anything. Would have been better applied to developing a guide with an index of what each class covers, some of the basic verb conjugations and a summary of the better key points or tips offered in the classes (e.g. when to use ser vs. estar, a+el=al, adjectives follow nouns...)
- Could use some careful editing!
There's a fair amount of mistakes in the exercises. Occasionally, english translation phrases are missing words they're supposed to have, phrases you hear don't match the written form, and minor inconsistencies abound. For example, an exercise sometimes requires ""veinte y dos"" and other times ""ventidos"" before accepting your answer as correct. Other times, it won't accept an answer because you added a space at the end of the sentence. It can get a bit frustrating. (There tend to me more of these in classes at the end of discs. Maybe they thought noone would make it that far!)

TIPS:
- use the F3 button during exercises if you want to hear a phrase, but click the PLAY button if you want to rehear it without erasing what you already have typed.
- On exercises where you match written spanish to written english translations, just look at the english versions and try to translate it before looking at the spanish ones.  I found I learned a lot more that way - because the matching was so easy.
- Until Fluenz gets around to including an index or posting one on their website, jot a note as you go through each class on the general things it covered.  This will really help if you want to go back and refresh your memory on something without having to wade through multiple classes.

BOTTOM LINE: All that said, and even with the few downsides or enhancements I'd like to see, I highly recommend this program for any adult with little to no spanish ability who wants to be able to hold their own in a conversation relatively quickly, and have the building blocks to grow their Spanish capabilities.  Living in Texas, I've had ample opportunity to practice what I've learned and have really been delighted I've been able to both understand and to be understood.",Minor complaints aside - this program really delivers!,1236643200,59,

Didn't happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I've tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there (fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out) thinking they've got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply don't exist.

IMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files!

I honestly think they don't want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you don't need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason.

iPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it doesn't. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together (I guess there is a little family resemblance there). The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you're probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually (next 2-3 years) as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you could say iPhoto is ahead of its time.

Garage Band works like it should, but there aren't any improvements that make it worth upgrading. The much flaunted lessons must be bought and downloaded, they don't come with the software. It is useful certainly, but I just don't see anything that makes me believe upgrading is worth it.

Frankly, this is just another ho-hum release. You don't need to upgrade unless you just have to have GPS photo tracking or face recognition software. If you were hoping (like me) that iMovie would be more robust, think again. It would have been very easy for Apple to include two versions of iMovie: advanced and basic. Basic would be the default setting and advanced would include the features lost from the 06 version. It could be turned on or off for the best of both worlds. Instead I have iMovie HD installed on top of iLife 09. Waste of hard drive space.

iLife 09 doesn't offer any compelling reason to update if you have iLife 08. There aren't any improvement that are not relatively minor or obscure (face recognition for example). And there is one MASSIVE disadvatage, at least for those who prefer iMovie 06: installing iMovie 09 will cause iMovie 06 to become inoperable! You have no choice in the matter, and no prompt lets you know that you are losing iMovie HD by installing iLife 09. It just happens.

Why Apple doesn't allow the user to control how many or few features are available is beyond me. I'm not saying everyone should want all the features from iMovie 06, but for those of us that do, why not make them available? This sort of 'one size fits all' approach is really frustrating.",iMovie09 will kill your installation of imovie HD! The rest of the programs are ho-hum,1233532800,12,

My big computer is in a noisy part of the house.  It really  needs 2 gigs of memory to function well.  I installed it anyway, though the machine only has 1.5 gigs after the maximum upgrade.

It works fine.  I have a Southern voice and there's an option to start off with a Southern recognition baseline.  The training took me about an hour all total, with an initial session that I did and saved some of the words it had missed.  One thing I like about the software is that it does let you save words that it has trouble with, so in the future it gets them right.  It 'learns.'

Since I didn't have all the memory it wanted, it wouldn't let me use MS Office.  I have to use it in a little pad and then transfer it over to Office.  It's a bit of a bother but not ALL that big of a deal.  It might be in you had a hand issue though.  I don't have any lag or problems with it this way.  I bet it would work, if it would let me try it, but it didn't give me that option, it just informed me that it wouldn't be working with MS Office.  I'd rather have an easy option to override that and see for myself.

One thing that might concern people that are worried about privacy is that it wants to go through your emails and documents - but it DOES give you the option.  This lets the software know more about your vocabulary and the way that you write normally.  There's also a request by the software to let you store these things online!

Once again this year, I found myself once again stuck with having to buy a copy of TT Business to do a simple 1120s, which has to be filed by March 15th, for a small S corporation.  Ouch, there goes $120!!

The only good news is that the software appeared to work fine (see ""two bugs found"" update below), with the exception that it updated itself at the very end of the entire interview process, rather than at the beginning, as was the case in the past.  Perhaps under the hood that makes no difference, but being a former software validation analyst, I suggest that the software UPDATE ITSELF at the beginning.  Not right before I e-File.  Other than that, I noticed no issues, but I only used it for a VERY simple 1120s filing, nothing as complex as my last 1065.

At the very end, while going through the steps to e-File, the software warns me that I need to file a STATE INCOME TAX RETURN.  I checked to be sure via Google, and Yes, I do need to file a corporate return with my state...  so I proceeded to do that, at which point TT Business asked me FOR ANOTHER $49.95 to download the state return for my state (FLORIDA).  What an INCREDIBLE RIPOFF!

I thought this was a complete package, (after all it is misleadingly described as ""Includes everything needed to complete your business income taxes"", and EVERYTHING to me means EVERYTHING!), plus I thought $120 was an outrageous amount to pay for software, and now at the last minute, they fleece you!  I DESPISE THIS KIND OF TACTIC and INTUIT should be ashamed! Frustrated that the listing says this software package ""Includes everything needed to complete your business income taxes"" when in fact, you have to pay $50 extra to do the state filing, which is not mentioned anywhere online that I can find (it does mention the extra $49.95 charge in tiny 5 point font on the back of the package if you buy it on CD, but not sure if you buy it online that you are made aware of this at all).

The good news is that my state has the short form I need online.  It's only about 4 pages of fill-in-the-blanks and can be mailed in.  It can even be e-Filed if you like.  Certainly not worth another $50, which I note is more than what the DELUXE software costs that does your entire personal return.

So, beware of the Trojan Horse on state returns, and do your own research online.  For my state, (FLORIDA), the form is called the F-1120A and can be found online for free...Be sure to check with your state to see what they require before you shell out even more bucks for state tax software THAT IMHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITH THE PACKAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE!","Software has BUGS, and overall it is a RIPOFF for Small businesses - See Why:",1391817600,5,

6557,3,False,"11 12, 2013",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B008H3SW4I,,Trenton Bennett,"BEFORE YOU UPGRADE: stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments). This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade. It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches. For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet! I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.

Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag. The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, ""Your Start Menu is now full-screen"": we have a ""Modern UI"" (formerly called ""Metro"") that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine. When you want to find a specific program or setting, you just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes. Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet: you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.

This is really the heart of Windows 8's problems: its identity crisis. It can be jarring to flip back and forth between Modern and Desktop views, but Microsoft can't let completely go of everything that came before without driving people even crazier, so there will be times you're trying to do a thing--like manage users or configure a network connection--and you might be in Modern's full-screen left-to-right only to find yourself dumped into the desktop and shown a dialog box you may remember from earlier versions...and then you need to head back to Modern to take another step. If you're doing everyday computing, like reading documents or checking mail, you don't run across this too often, but the moment you need to take step outside of the ordinary, good luck figuring out which path you should start from, or which you'll end up on.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy. Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7. Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8. Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop). Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything. Sometimes you can use the wheel to scroll and sometimes you can't. My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.

For some features, time will tell. I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score). The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel: expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen. If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS: so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.

Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.

UPDATE, 11/2013: Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better. If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost. The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8. Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences. I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason. Perhaps with time it will get better.","Stepping Forward, and Stumbling Along the Way",1384214400,2,

Let me say up front that I have actually used it.  Also note that I have used quite a few different types previously, my favorite being Adobe Premiere Elements.

This version from Pinnacle is not by any means user friendly.  If you are a novice, you won't find that the process has a ""easily walks me through it"" design to it by any means.  It is, in fact, fairly difficult to do even basic things...like add titles or captions to the timeline.

You will see a tab toward the bottom called ""SmartMovie,"" that does make things a little bit simpler....but even with this option it's still not all that easy to navigate your way through the process.

Two main things about this software that I found fairly annoying:

1) If you want to view the online training videos from Pinnacle, you can only do so if you subscribe to their site for $7 per month....otherwise the video stops about a fourth of the way through and a pop-up pushes you to make this purchase.  Until you do, you're blocked from viewing the videos.

2) It does not burn to Blue-ray discs unless you download a plug-in that will allow this feature, which also costs $7 to download.  Really Pinnacle?  I mean....really?  Even the MyDVD software that comes with it has a burn to Blue-ray option on it, which is greyed out because you have not yet purchased the plug-in.  Horrible business model, IMO.

What I did manage to do was to burn a short 4GB AVCHD movie on a DVD DL disc, and I was able to include a title for it.  Oddly, the transition from one clip to another had special effects built in for switching from one clip to another...swiping from left to right, loading the next clip from the middle out, etc.  At first it was pretty cool to look at, but eventually it got annoying.  I was able to finally figure out from the manual how to go in and take the transitions out of the timeline.  It was strange to me that these special transition effects were set up by default.

When I tried to burn a larger, 10GB movie (as a side note, all of these are HD family vacation footage), of course I couldn't load it on a DVD DL disc due to its size, so I decided to save the file and then I would burn it from my Adobe software. Halfway through to exporting it to the folder, however, the Studio 20 software froze up and stopped exporting....so I had to close it.  BTW, I have a fairly robust PC....Core i7 CPU, 12GB RAM, etc.

Basically, unless you want software to make AVCHD movies less than 8.5GB in total size that will not burn to Blue-ray unless you download a plug-in at an additional cost, I would look elsewhere.  My suggestion is Adobe Premier Elements....that's the one I have had the most success with.  I can't recommend this one.","Not user friendly, and lacks some key features you should be aware of.",1474761600,15,

7207,3,False,"11 12, 2013",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B00AM9YXTS,,Trenton Bennett,"UPDATE:  Windows 8 users can now upgrade to Windows 8.1.  The free upgrade is not as obvious as using Windows Update:  instead it is posted in the Microsoft Store and you'll need to launch the Store to get to it.  From there, Microsoft has added what they call ""Update for Windows 8.1"", and the tweaks in this update (to the update) are remarkable improvements to the OS in subtle ways.  It's also important to note that a Windows 8.1 user will lose support for their product if it is not patched with ""Update for Windows 8.1"" a lot sooner than users of 8 or of 8.1 with the update.

BEFORE YOU UPGRADE: stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments). This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade. It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches. For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet! I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.

Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag. The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, ""Your Start Menu is now full-screen"": we have a ""Modern UI"" (formerly called ""Metro"") that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine. When you want to find a specific program or setting, you just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes. Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet: you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.

This is really the heart of Windows 8's problems: its identity crisis. It can be jarring to flip back and forth between Modern and Desktop views, but Microsoft can't let completely go of everything that came before without driving people even crazier, so there will be times you're trying to do a thing--like manage users or configure a network connection--and you might be in Modern's full-screen left-to-right only to find yourself dumped into the desktop and shown a dialog box you may remember from earlier versions...and then you need to head back to Modern to take another step. If you're doing everyday computing, like reading documents or checking mail, you don't run across this too often, but the moment you need to take step outside of the ordinary, good luck figuring out which path you should start from, or which you'll end up on.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy. Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7. Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8. Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop). Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything. Sometimes you can use the wheel to scroll and sometimes you can't. My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.

For some features, time will tell. I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score). The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel: expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen. If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS: so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.

Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.

UPDATE, 11/2013: Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better. If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost. The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8. Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences. I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason. Perhaps with time it will get better.",A Forward Step that Stumbles Over its Past,1384214400,2,

Bottom-Line: Excellent application for running Widows in the iMac environment!

I am a Microsoft Windows user, have been since the release of Windows 3.0 was back in 1989.  I have used each new release of Windows up through Windows 7 the most stable and user-friendly version of the software yet.  But when my Dell XPS AIO started giving my problems I decided to replace it with an Apple iMac desktop running OSX Lion.  Needless to say the decision was not an easy one, so invested am I in everything Windows.  But the decision made I knew I wanted to still run Windows 7 on my iMac and I could do it one of two ways: Apple's Boot Camp application built-into OSX that allows one to run either OSX or Windows, or VMWare Fusion For Mac Version 4.0, which allows one to run both OSX Lion and Windows simultaneously.

Virtual computing; the technology has been around for a while in the Enterprise and VMWare has been the company leading the vanguard.  VMWare Fusion for Mac Version 4.0 allows me to run Windows 7 (Windows XP or Windows Vista) on the iMac without having to reboot the computer and also allows for the sharing of hardware, such as printers and external hard drives between the two OS's.  That last function piece--the ability to share hardware--was also very import piece of the virtual machine puzzle, because I still need the ability to scan documents to .PDF format and store on a Windows-based network.

For all of my needs VMWare Fusion for Mac fit the bill nicely, and it allows me to run a 64-bit version of Windows 7.  Installation of the software on the iMac was simple and easy.  You can choose one of two install methods; 1. via an included memory stick, or; 2. via DVD.  I choose the memory stick, because during the install process I could slip the Windows 7 disc in the iMac CD-ROM player and have the install process install Windows 7after it installed itself.  All told the install took a little over an hour to complete, afterward I had a fully functional Windows 7 desktop computer!

After I ran the install I configured VMWare Fusion for Mac to use share the printer and use an attached hard drive only on Windows 7. After those quick configuration changes were made I was able to download and install Windows security updates and join the Virtual Machine (VM) to the Windows 2003/2008 domain I have set up in my home.

Switching between OSX and Windows 7 is simple: a two finger swipe on the Apple Magic mouse is all it takes to toggle between the two OS's.  I am typing this review on Microsoft Word 2010 installed on my Windows 7 VM, while also using Google Chrome to surf the internet.  Meanwhile back on OSX I am streaming live cool Jazz music!
VMWare Fusion for Mac allows you to tweak the VM for optimum performance; e.g. you can set the processor number (1 or 2), Ram allocation and hard drive space.  The VM will have to be powered off in order to adjust these settings.  VMWare does recommend you limit the processor number to unless you have a demanding application that needs more performance space.

Like most virtual machine application VMWare Fusion for Mac will suspend the VM when the iMac is shut down or restarted, so you will not lost any work.

Conclusion

VMWare Fusion for Mac Version 4 is the ideal solution for my needs and I highly recommend it for anyone thinking about running Windows on an iMac.

Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

I still use Photoshop for most of my quick image editing jobs - because I am very comfortable with the menus, layout, and image corrections. But last year I added Corel Patinshop Pro X5 to my software list.  I ended up loving the HUGE set of plug-ins and one-click image enhancement macros.  This year's new X6 edition adds even more plug-ins!  So when I want to make my photos uniquely different I play with the dozens of different macros that Corel has.  As you'll learn, some of these same plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop cost more than the Corel software! So it's a deal in itself!

The biggest improvement that I noticed in the X6 version this year is the better menu system.  I'm starting to get a lot faster using Corel. This gets me using the software more often.  I'll be curious to see how much I continue to use Adobe Photoshop as the year moves forward.

The bottom line is for under $100 you can't find a better image editing program!

For those shoppers looking for image editing software, my advice is:

-- If you only edit images on occasion and just want to re-size, perform white balancing, or leveling - then GIMP is a free imaging software that will work for you.  GIMP is fully loaded with all the fundamental correction abilities that a basic image editor will require.  And the software is free.  Keep in mind that GIMP runs slower than Corel and Adobe... and doesn't have the plug-ins or cool macros.  Of course you can also use the online editing tools like Flickr and Picasa.

-- If you want to create exciting and sometimes wild adjustments to your photos (like adding noise, old time photograph effects, lens flares, HDR, blemish removers, wrinkle removers, and color filters) then Corel Paintshop Pro X6 is for you. And for under $100, this is a great deal.

-- If you are a professional and share files with other professionals; if you light to manually adjust your photos piece by piece; or want the fasting running imaging software, then Adobe Photoshop is for you.  At nearly $400, this is a huge jump in price. So you might need a strong reason to shell out the cash, when other software will do the job just as well.  Also Adobe Lightroom is another software offering - but this is just for image correction based on camera models and lens.  It's the most ""techie"" of the programs... is a bit dry and limiting.  People shooting for magazines and weddings often use Lightroom to perform preliminary editing that may have been missed while shooting.(color leveling, lens filters, etc).  Then Photoshop adds some more image effects, like sharpening and blurring.

-- I don't consider Adobe Photoshop Elements on the list of recommended products, even though it's quite popular.  For the price, it's offers very little features.  I feel they watered it down too much.

Summary.  Think of Adobe Photoshop for the paid professional, Corel Paintshop for the home hobbyist or part time professional, and GIMP or web-based editors for the occasional user.",X6 updates it's menus + GREAT NEW plug-ins.,1383350400,106,

Do not buy this program unless you carry your install disks everywhere you take your computer.

I have downgraded my review from 4 stars to 1, and completely deleted my original review text.

During a recent trip, I tried opening MapPoint and received the error message ""Your registry settings for this application weren't copied correctly"". The fix shown was to uninstall and re-install the program. A significant difficulty since I was on the road, and don't typically lug around the install disks for every program I own whenever I leave home.

This was bad enough, but I understand there are sometimes odd glitches and just dealt with it until returning home. It did put me in a bad situation as I had all my maps and route information stored in the MapPoint program. Fortunately, my GPS was able to take over and everything worked out.

After returning home, over the course of the next few months I tried uninstalling and re-installing the program, following the Microsoft online instructions for a clean install. Same error message. I then tried uninstall/reinstall, clean reg, remove all saved maps, add another user and then open. Same error message.

Next step, contacting Microsoft directly. Unfortunately, unless you have the Product number you need to pay $35 for the pleasure of speaking or typing to someone. The product number is, of course, only accessible within the Menu once you open the program - WHICH I CANNOT DO. If I could open the program, I wouldn't need to talk to Microsoft about a program that won't open. See the problem here?

I've searched the internet, tried ever fix and workaround listed, and come to the conclusion after a few months of messing with this thing that even if I could get it up and running again, I would never trust it to not fail during another road trip. Thus, rendering a Map program, which I use for TRAVEL, completely useless.

I have a feeling that my problem stems from doing an install from an external DVD player. My travel laptop does not have an internal CD/DVD drive, so this is my only option, but I have a feeling it's the root of the problem.

My suggestion to anyone looking at this or the updated MapPoint 2011 is to only purchase it if you will be using it exclusively on in a desktop environment, and only if you are installing from an internal CD/DVD drive.","MapPoint leaves me mapless, so what's the point?",1266451200,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Kb94AJuXL._SY88.jpg']

___________________________________________________________________________________________
Let start by saying I am an old time user of CorelDraw.  I used it for years at my job and loved it.  The Suite X8 offers much more and still has the feel and performance I remember.  I am also a Adobe Photoshop user.  I ended up moving more into using Photoshop mainly due to more local classes and support compared to CorelDraw, though Corel was/is my favorite.  If you are looking at this Suite I'm sure it is because you know what you need for your job.  I don't see the hobby types using or buying this based on the cost.

Installation was painless and flawless.  I guess we would hope so for this price range of product.  Once installed I find everything seems to work well.  I would like to give a more detailed review, however I am unable with the amount of time given me to complete this.  You see, I received this from Amazon Vine to review and I received this package for the cost of the taxes on the product.  I will make a good attempt to update this review as I have more time to explore and use it.

All in all if you need a graphics program for work, this is an excellent suite package and offers more for the money than my Adobe package other than local training.

I have used Photoshop a lot but never used a work flow package other than iPhoto, so despite understanding the concepts of workflow I have not had any practical experience using any tool like Lightroom.  So out of the box this was a little intimidating to use.

Setup/installation - This worked great other than having to update my Mac OS to 10.9 to get it to install.  Once the OS was up to date, the actual installation was very quick, just a few minutes.

Starting Use - Here things got a little hairier.  Much like Photoshop, there are lots of options, likely many that an individual will never use.  The tool icons are familiar, but took a while to get the gyst and some old digital images imported.  Immediately the things I like are the ability to change the white balance of batched photos.  I batched a series of images of Marmots and Ground Squirrels in Alaska and took them from worthless to perfect in no time (if you subtract the time it took me to figure out how to get them all batch selected and then converted.

HDR - I was also excited to see that HDR is built in.  I have long played with Photomatix's trial version but have been afraid to pull the trigger.  Also, I have used the Photoshop plug in and this built in option is more like the plug in and less dynamic than Photomatix.  Or at least with my current abilities.  I can get it to make decent HDR images again testing with Alaskan images of glaciers, but I cannot get that unworldly look.  Not sure if that is me, or not in the abilities of this software.

Compared to Turbo Tax it is less costly.  I have used Turbo Tax in the past and have found both Turbo Tax and H&R Block to be very similar in terms of being able to handle my returns in a complete and efficient manner with no issues.  The lower price of H&R Block made the decision to go with them very easy.

One issue and complaint that I do have with H&R Block was the very high price it charged to add on a state return ($40) if you did not purchase a software package that initially included a state return.  A late W-2 from earnings (8 Years Ago!) attributed to a state I no longer live in surprised me after I had already purchased the software.  Rather than purchase an addition state for $40 I found it cheaper to buy another complete H&R Block software package from Amazon that included a state return for $20.  The pricing policies being practiced by both Turbo Tax and H&R Block seemed to determined more by greed than commonsense.  As usual, Amazon.com is the best place to purchase!!

This year I also tried the On-Line Tax Act to see how it compared.  It had some issues with utilizing information from my last year's H&R Block return.  Not a big problem, but, it did require a bit of proofreading and correcting basic information.  I found the information in Tax Act to be more complete, but, perhaps a bit more technical and complicated than is necessary.  It did not handle one issue with a rather uncommon stock option trade without some tinkering.  H&R Block was much easier to use.

I consider myself a novice user in that I don't use the software everyday or professionally. I am, however, well versed in Photoshop and a few other offerings from smaller companies like ACDSee.

So first things first, installation; I installed X5 on my beefy HP laptop running Windows 7 and 8gb of RAM. I encountered absolutely no issues on install other than the installer taking quite a bit of time to finish loading the entire suite. All-in-all the process took about 30-40 minutes including registering the product, launching and turning off the tips that launch with the program.

This suite includes Photo Paint X5; Corel Draw X5; Corel Connect and a few other applications. For my purposes I'm a bigger user of Photo Paint. The layout is pretty intuitive to anyone that's used an advanced photo editing suite before. You can load an image and the only real limitation is your imagination. It's super easy to make quick adjustment to photos including adding effects like motion blur or lens flare (a little cheesy sure) or take a large file size and parse it down into a smaller (lossy) format. Since getting the software I've used it to sharpen images, remove red-eye from photos and blur certain aspects of images. For example I sold my wife's Mini Cooper and needed to skew her license plate before posting. A simple tool later and the plates were pixilated and unreadable and ready for exporting and posting.

Corel Draw is an interesting application and one that is really uniquely suited to artists. My sister for example is an art major and experimenting with various digital drawing tools and hardware. She used her Bamboo Pen Tablet in conjunction with Draw X5 to make some really quick and amazing artwork right on my laptop. I'll admit that's she's better suited to reviewing this aspect of the Corel Draw Suite than I am but I can address her impression here. In comparing Draw X5 to Autodesk (another application she uses on her own computer) she admitted that Autodesk seemed to be deeper and have more tools, brushes, and effects but was impressed with the layout and ease of using the Corel software.

In my own use I've used Corel Draw to make quick notes and modifications to images - specifically QC'ing maps in .tiff, .jpeg (and other formats) It's a great tool, handles a huge assortment of file types and can export to a large variety of formats.

For novices like me Corel offers a TON of help to get you started. The software links directly to Corel for loads of how-to videos and tutorials. There is also a huge and active community of Corel users out there and various forums to support everyone from pro's to novices. The production level on the Corel tutorials is professional and the people teaching clearly have a thorough understanding of the applications.

I'm not claiming that Dragon Dictate is 100% accurate, but if you learn how to use it properly, it will type what you clearly dictate, and it never misspells words.

My recommendations for learning how to use the program:

1. Read the manual, and also do a search for the Dragon Dictate Workbook for Mac, which includes a series of exercises that will help you learn the features of the program.

2. Practice writing dictation by keeping a daily journal for at least a month. This way, when it comes to dictating more formal and important pieces of writing, it won't be so frustrating to use the program. Practice, practice, practice.

3. Use either Dragon Dictate built-in notebook, Apple's Text Edit, or Microsoft Word for longform dictations. Dragon Dictate integrates with these programs and it allows you to both do dictation and manual typing without it getting confused. Dragon Dictate will work in other text editors, but not as well as the three mentioned above. There is also a built-in editor that you can call up in DD (say, ""open Express Editor"") to dictate text and  transfer it to another text box in a webpage or text editor. I highly recommend that before you click the transfer button, that you select and copy the text before making the transfer.

4. I find it better to dictate in phrases rather than trying to dictate entire sentences at a time. Also make use of the Recognition window so that you can see the alternative words or phrases that Dictate thinks you might be saying.

5. If you do not have experience with writing dictation, it will probably take significant time to learn the program. So it's important that you practice every day. I would say it took me almost a year for me to really get comfortable with using Dictate. I mainly use it to write journal entries, reviews like this one, and other pieces of writing in which I'm not doing research while also trying to type.

6. And finally, I would say that it helps to run Dictate on a Mac with at least 8 GB of RAM.

Dragon Dictate doesn't necessarily make you a better writer, nor does it help you get writing down faster. What it does is eliminate the need for hand typing. When you are doing dictation, you have to think about what you're going to say before you say it, and I can feel somewhat awkward, and it does take some time to formulate thoughts in your mind before speaking. So again, the main advantage of using this program is that it reduces the need for lots of typing. You will still need to read through what you dictate, and revise and edit what is typed out for you.",Has Improved With Each Major Update,1400198400,8,

Unlike everything else out there that requires several steps to capture audio, Creator 10 installs a widget on your screen in which you simple press a red ""record"" button to capture a clip.  After the capture is completed you are taken to a very easy to use audio editing screen where you can trim and equalize your clip before saving it to a variety of popular formats.  This application alone is worth the price of the entire bundle.
Also included are a competent backup program, nice media player (but come on, who needs another media player with Microsoft, Apple and Real dominating the market?), label creator, media manager (a cool app that catalogs all those unlabeled CD/SVD disks you have laying around), apps to easily create music and video compilations, a nice photo editing app plus a panorama photo stitcher, a pretty capable video editing program (although I'm puzzled why it can't read FLV files), a cassette/LP converter tool, and about 10 more highly useful tools.

Negatives?  Well first of all I will semi-dispute what several reviewers have said about it freezing their system on installation.  I thought so too, and then realized that a full install was loading over 50,000 files into my computer and even though I have a very powerful computer, the process took almost 45 minutes, making it the longest load time for any software I've ever owned.  Where Roxio messed up is that the install screen only has a simple message that ""installation may take several minutes"".  There are long periods ... like a couple of minutes at a time ... where the status bar does nothing and you would swear your computer is frozen.  You just have to have a lot of patience and resist the urge to terminate the install, which may be why some people have had so much trouble with the software.  Roxio could save a lot of frustration by making the install process a little more clear.
My other concern is that my anti-virus and anti-spyware programs (from two different companies) both identified Creator 10 as mal-ware.  I would like to know more about what information Roxio is gathering from my computer and how they are using it.  Software companies should be more open with their customers about such things.

Bottom line is that I don't think Creator 10 is as bad as some people make it out to be.  Today's computers are incredibly complex and there seems to be a tendency to blame hardware or software for lack of understanding of how computers work.  Other than your operating system, Creator 10 is probably one of the most complicated things you can install on your computer and there is no doubt it will have a noticeable effect on performance.  If you choose to go with Creator 10 make sure you have a very capable system with plenty of hard drive space and as much memory as you can afford.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I think overall the positives outweigh the negatives.",A ton of bang for the buck,1201046400,39,

I had no problems with the program.  It installed with no problems, checked for updates (none), found various copies of my 2010 tax file, allowed me to select one of them.  I quickly reviewed the imported 2010 info, and it all looked correct.

I don't use the ""import from Quicken"" feature, because I find that it sometimes causes problems.  Instead, I create reports in Q that I export in TXF format, which I can then import into TT.  This worked fine.  I couldn't download my brokerage & mutual fund information yet, obviously, since that will not be available until late Jan or early Feb.  Same with the W2 info.  Instead I entered some info based on my records, just to go through the preliminary calculation.  Everything worked as expected.  BUT note that some forms (e.g., Sch D) aren't finalized yet, are waiting for the IRS.

One note: Intuit pushes the more expensive Premier version for those with investment income, but you don't need it unless your situation is rather complex.  If all you have is mutual funds and some brokerage stock/bond transactions, you're likely to be fine with Deluxe.  (If you have option trading, you'll have to look into the details, Deluxe might still be fine.)
NOTE:  Thought it might be helpful to briefly report here what TT says about why they recommend Premier; they help if the following apply to you: Unsure of your capital gains? Don't know your cost basis? Confused by ESPP sales?

Also note that in the past I've used H&R Block (aka TaxCut), and have found it to be about as good as TT.  If I were paying money, I'd get the one that's cheaper.  (I get TT discounts from my fund company, hence it's cheaper for me.)

I'll update this review in Feb after I've done more with the program.  (See below.)

Quick note on hidden privacy option:
Just noticed that Intuit hid a privacy option nice and deep.  Go into Help-About, and select the Privacy tab.  You'll see a box to permit sharing metrics about your usage.  Seems perfectly reasonable and harmless, but it annoys me that they felt it was ok to hide it like that.  So guess what, I unchecked it.  You can decide for yourself, I don't think it's a big deal either way.

1/12/12 Update:

Since my review above I've been able to download the state program, and it did fine with my preliminary information.  Full test will wait until I have all my data.

I ran into a problem with W-2 imports: the program won't let me enter cents in the box 1 & box 5 fields, just whole dollars, but then the import fails saying data mismatch.  Interesting.  I spent about 40 minutes in a chat session with someone in tech support, who was unable to provide any useful information at all.  (Began with the usual ""it works on my machine"".  I used to say ""ok, then ship me your machine"".)  Intuit brags about the excellent US-based tech support, but I was unimpressed.

2/17/12 Update:

There have been many bug fix updates over the last few weeks (at least 5, maybe more), which is good in the sense that they're delivering fixes quickly as they have them.  (No one's found a way to create bug-free software yet, of course!)  I've not run into any problems lately, and the W-2 problem I mentioned above was also fixed (I can't fully test it, not having multiple paychecks).

One good thing to report: my state tax return (MA) took very little time to do and review: the initial data entry captures just about all the useful information that transfers neatly to the state return, and all I had to was to go through the yes/no stuff and then review the return.

One area TT could improve: the entry of capital gain transactions is unnecessarily tedious, requiring that you go through several screens for each transaction.  This became particularly annoying when I had to go through them to correct a set of errors I found in my data (incorrect records).  It would be so much easier to have an option to enter the transactions on a table.  (No, the ""quick entry"" spreadsheet doesn't do it for me, it's an ugly user interface in my opinion, makes it too easy to make errors.)

On another note: I used TT to do some what-if calculations related to getting a Schedule K-1 from an S-corp (with ""material participation""), and found it quite useful.  When you get to this kind of thing the program doesn't really help you much, you have to know the tax laws and rules  (or learn quickly!)  in order to do the right things.  But at least I was able to have the program do the calcs for me, which saved me a ton of time.

In summary, I found this year's TT to be a pretty good program, worth the 4 stars I initially gave it, with enough shortcomings to fall short of a 5-star product.",worked fine for me,1324425600,177,

If you run a Mac you most likely have no anti-virus or anti malware software running. That could be a mistake. As the Mac becomes more and more popular, having protection is a good thing. That's where this product comes in. One of the most common places to pick up trouble is while surfing the Internet. ""Smart Surfing"" is there  to protect you.

To start with, the installation was simple and quick. Insert the CD and follow the onscreen prompts and installs just that easily.  Most of the protective tasks occur in the background and automatically. On my Mac Mini, I requested a full scan and it took about 20 hours to complete! That's a bit looooong but all was well. It will automatically update itself also to get the newest definition files.

There really isn't much to notice, it all goes on in the background. You're protected against virii, phishing, malware and spyware.  It does its job quietly and efficiently.

So I have to compare how much of an improvement there has been compared to the years before that. New versions (actually new releases, using the industry parlance that was in place when Quicken for DOS first hit the market) are iterative, add some new features, but are largely the same as older versions with only one or two significantly new or improved features. If you put this in a historical context, that's actually a good thing. When Scott Cook first came up with Quicken, he didn't take the traditional approach. He advertised in airline magazines rather than computer magazines and advertised to ""regular people"" rather than computer people. Instead of selling for the inflation-adjusted price of $854, which was common for spreadsheets, databases and word processors of the day, he sold the software for well under $100, inflation adjusted. And he sold annual updates for a price low enough that it was literally cheaper than buying an aftermarket book on how to use the product. They weren't major changes, but they were affordable. So when you pay a mere $39.99 for the entire product, depending on the version, you are benefiting from a revolution that Scott Cook single-handedly put in place to change the entire software industry.

In that sense, you get a lot for your money. When I first started using Quicken, it was an easy way to keep my checkbook balanced, and allowed me to print checks directly from a dot matrix printer. Over time, support was added for credit cards, investments, real property, and even business functions depending on the version. The software lets you look at the big picture when it comes to your finances. It lets you link accounts in such a way that you can see what comes out of one account when it goes into another account, or what goes from your cash account to your investment account or from your checking account to pay your credit card bills. It lets you keep track of your receipts and keep images of your checks or invoices with the individual transactions. And it keeps track of your securities, monitors the prices, and shows you how well your investments perform. It does so a lot better than tools you might find at your brokerage since there are so many ways of reporting things.

The latest version has cloud support and support for an app for your phone. Yes, it's limited to spending accounts and you will still have to use an app from your broker to get an instant view of your investments. Then again, you would need to do so to execute trades anyway. But for spending, it's a lot easier to snap a photo of a receipt with a smartphone than to scan it or enter it later, so when it syncs with the desktop app, it's easier to match things up with downloaded transactions.

It's come a long way from its origins, and although I no longer need it for printing out the checks to pay my monthly bills, I can use it to track more complex financial concerns such as stocks, bonds, options trading, ESPP shares, employee stock options, the value of my home, my mortgage payments with an ongoing view of principal and interest, and even paychecks with the amount split to account for federal, state, and local taxes, FICA, medicare and deductions for 401(k)s (which end up in the appropriate account register automatically) or healthcare spending or ESPPs. It lets you keep track of spending by categories, and allows for tags (formerly classes) so you can track things in multiple directions. If you want to get a report on spending by category or figure out how much you spent on education or dining, it's easy. And if you tag things so that you know which expenses were for your 2006 Hawaii trip, you can know how much you spent in total or break it down by airfare, lodging, meals or souvenirs. You can even use foreign currency and account for exchange rates.  You can use as little or as many of these features as you want. You can establish budgets and see how well you've been doing for years or decades, depending on how long you've been using the product.

The product isn't perfect and still has a few bugs in it that affect usability but not the underlying financial integrity of your data. And some tasks are easier than others. Some of the wizards work from some places and not others. And some areas are not optimized for the type of security. For example, options trading is a thinly disguised version of stock trading, won't let you use standard actions such as ""sell to open"", ""buy to close"" or expire contracts based on the date in the symbol and the price of the underlying security. You might need to use less obvious terms such as buying to cover at zero cost in order to close out expired contracts. And you need to view things as shares instead of contracts. Plus there's no price history for options. And there's no support for RSUs, despite the fact that the people in charge of Quicken have been granted RSUs, and thus can't use the product to track their own finances in a comprehensive way.

Despite the limitations, the product still covers the most common needs of most users. I'd like to see more emphasis on adding support for new features such as the ones I've mentioned, especially given that they aren't major programming tasks. I think the product has gotten so comprehensive that they are running out of ideas as to what to add for new releases.

The product also comes with three years of data service at no extra charge, after which you will most likely want to get a newer version. I think they would have had fewer detractors had they marketed the data service as a separate entity and let you know they are bundling it for free. The product itself does not expire, as many people think, but becomes a lot less useful once the data service expires and you can no longer download from your financial institutions. It's simply too expensive for the company to offer that kind of support for a longer period than what they cover, and it's cheap enough that even if you don't upgrade annually, it's worth getting a new version at least every two years.

For one thing, this is not one program, or a suite of programs, it is a bunch of individual programs that you have to open separately and work with separately. Even remembering what each does (and some overlap) is difficult. I found myself opening a picture in one program, only to remember it wasn't the one I was thinking and have to open a different program to make things happen. Working with files that included more than 20 photos made everything lag so badly it was ridiculous.

The thing is, I use Photoshop. It is not ""fun"", but if I spend the time to create something, the end result is impressive.

the Symantec fold.  For anyone who started their computing
hobby or career with Norton's software and books, or Central
Point's software and hardware products, you know where I'm
going with this: Symantec ruins a good product.
All right, ""ruins"" is a strong word, but let me illustrate
in this exact case.  WRQ's AtGuard was a model of simplicity.
It threw a popup box whenever it encountered an event it didn't
have a rule to match.  Let's say incoming traffic fell through
all your rules: AtGuard asks ""What should I do?  Allow it
all the time, just this once, block it once, or block it all
the time?""  Four choice, covers the gamut.  In the cases of
ads, that's enough.  In the cases of TCPIP or ICMP traffic,
permanent choices also brings you right into a quick dialog
of exactly what to block (port, address) and how to name it
(blocking 427 incoming, blocking ms-sql-m traffic).
For NIS, especially the NIS2k series, you don't have these
advanced choices.  You also have a great deal of ""preset""
rules that aren't always useful, because they err on the side
of blocking rather than permitting.  Good for newbies, not
good for pros.
Another downside if you're experienced is that to get to rule
editors and advanced options, you have to click through an
enormous cascade of menus.  In AtGuard, it's two clicks away.
That's just unacceptable: if the purpose is to keep newbies
out of the advanced menus, just add a password and unlock
the necessary menus.
Finally, NIS2k does away with site-specific ad filtering.
Inexplicably, you have to choose to block images from an entire
domain instead of a single machine.  For anyone who surfs Yahoo,
you understand the value of allowing us.yimg.com and
not us.a1.yimg.com.
In terms of how NIS2k works with systems, I strongly
deter individuals from using it.  It has a poor installation
procedure, it doesn't co-exist properly with enough software,
and it's a bit of a mess to uninstall.  NIS2k and Symantec's
virus scanner products are notorious sources of software
conflicts in professional networks, and my professional and
personal experiences bear this out.
I can't recommend NIS2k3 to anyone who doesn't already use it and like; I wouldn't try to convert anyone who seems satisifed with their results.  However, if you want a better ad blocker, either get the original AtGuard, or use a proxy filter.

I used it as a desktop publisher and a typesetter and to create architectural shop drawings. These days, I use it to create graphics that I can import into embroidery digitizing programs to create custom embroidery designs.

The reason it's so wonderful is that it created graphics in a vector-based format. Vector based graphics are different than, say, bitmaps because they are infinitely re-sizeable without any loss of resolution. Vector images are mathematical descriptions of the image, which is exactly the same at any size. Bitmaps, on the other hand, are composed of an exact number of pixels so they suffer greatly when sized up - jagged edges and loss of sharpness.

Corel offers an incredibly full-featured graphics suite so that almost anything you need to create, edit, or produce can be done comepletely within the product. It includes an extensive font library and stock images, artwork, backgrounds, symbols and template galleries that are spectacular for business applications as well as individual users.

The suite includes several programs - CorelDRAW x7, Capture x7, Power Trace x7, Photo-Paint x7, Connect x7, Website Creator and Bitstream Font Navigator. (You must download Website Creator from the Corel website after you install and register CorelDRAW x7 and set up an account. The account gives you access to updates and all sorts of extra help, tutorials, community discussions as well as other downloads.

Inside the box is the install disk and a quick reference card. (The registration key is located in the plastic disc case behind the disk.) Unlike early versions, there are no printed instruction manuals and font/clip art catalogs. Instead, the almost 700 page users guide is on Corel's site and can be downloaded to your computer. There are also over 5 hours of tutorial videos included with the program that allows even complete novices to begin using this software with confidence.

Installation went smoothly for me. Note: The EULA only allows you to have this software installed on one computer at any time.

Besides the software, there are 1,000, high-quality, OpenType fonts, 800 background patterns and frames, more than 10,000 pieces of clip art, 2000 stock digital photos, 2,000 vehicle templates and 350 templates.

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",Great Array For The Price,1332720000,,

The program was driving me crazy.  Now after two months of using it, I believe Corel has done a good job with this program. Yes it does not compare to Photoshop but that is like comparing apples to oranges. Paintshop Pro really competes with photoshop elements and as a user of that product also, I will admit Paintshop Pro is better.

The install process does a take a while but so most applications in this field.  The first thing I did after installation was run an update.. I highly recommend this when using Corel's prodcuts.  I have some bad experiences a few of there other programs.

The interface is nice but is not real user friendly, so it does require extra time to learn what features are availble to you.  Corel has gone down the same path as other and uses a black interface.

Using the product
One the first thing the app wants to do is scan your computer images. I pointed towards my folder stucture that I use with lightroom. The organizer is easy to use and has a good feel to it.

When it came to editing photos this is where I struggled at first.  Photoshop Elememts is defintely easier but does not have as many edit capabilites. Corel did include some one step fix features but I believe they did not work well enough for me, I wanted more control. When I ran the one step photo fix I felt the photo became to overexposed and needed tweeking.

With HDR Imagery being the rage lately, Corel included it in X3.  It does not produce the result I like from HDR and does not give enough control like Photomatix.  I am going knock Corel for this because I was suprised to see it even included.

Performacnce wise I did not experienceany real slowness but I am running Intel I Core.  If you have any older computer you may experience slowness, I base this off pf past experiences with the Corel software.

I would definitely recommend this to friends and family with understanding there may be some frustration in the beginning because it is not as easy as Photoshop Elements to use.

One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.

With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.

Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec.

The installation was easy on my older (3+ years) WinXP desktop system with 2gb of ram memory. Painter runs fine on my system with minor delays on occasion, mostly during autopainting related steps. It has crashed a few times when I seemed to get way out in left field trying new things in a rushed manner but I was able to restart the program and continue on easy enough.

Based on my prior experience with photo related software (Photoshop CS3, Nikon Capture NX2, etc.) I feel that Painter 11 is a solid and well heeled painterly specific product that is very close to Photoshop in software quality, features (toolkit) based on primary purpose, and usability. I would have rated Painter equal to Photoshop CS3 in software quality but CS3 has never crashed on me.

At first I got stuck because I didn't have a workflow to follow, but after watching some tutorials I made great progress and enjoyed the journey. I highly recommend John Derry's Workflow Tutorials at Corel's website under resources and then follow his lead.

I also bought Karen Sperling's Painting for Photographers ebook that has step-by-step instructions tailored for Corel Painter. It is easy to follow and you also get some relevant painting theory and practices which were very helpful. Her software mastery with Corel Painter is impressive and her ability to teach me made the tutorial worth every penny spent.

The Corel Painter 11 supplied User Guide under the Help menu was useful also.

After learning the essentials of navigating around in the program and its myriad of features, with much thanks to the tutorials I used, I can see why a master artist would use and rely on this program to transform photos into digital paintings of the highest quality.

I have found the progression of steps from beginning photo to finished painterly art is quite logical for image editing software. There is support for non-destructive layers, cloning, underpainting, tracing, dodging, burning, rubber stamping, along with a huge assortment of customizable brushes, chalks, pencils, etc., and artistic effects. It will be a long time before I exhaust the possibilities presented to me in this software.

I like the auto painting underpainting feature with color scheme selections as I can get well into the painting process quickly and the results are much better than other programs I have tried. Underpainting's Smart Blur set to 100% was impressive. The tracing feature is very nice because I can paint intelligently with the original photo ""underneath"" at a lesser opacity as my guide and then quickly flip back and forth between the painting and the original photo to see my progress.

I was originally drawn to Corel Painter because some of the masters use this tool quite successfully and it is recommended often in painterly forum discussions. I was not disappointed by following their lead.","The best Painter program for pros, or regular users looking for pro results.",1254787200,6,

Significantly enough that you'll notice. But not so much that there would be a learning curve to get around when using it. The whole thing is pretty much plug-n-play. If you're familiar with Toast 7, this will be a snap for you. If not, everything is fairly well spelled out, if not obvious for a mid-level Mac user. If you can do drag and drop functions, you can use Toast 8.

One of the big selling points for this program is the integration of TiVoToGo capabilities. This has been elusive to Mac users up until now. For many, it will still be elusive. What you will find out upon installation is that it will work with properly equipped Series 2 or Series 3 boxes. However, it will not work with DirecTv supplied TiVo units. Also, you should be aware that not all TiVo units have their USB ports enabled. Thus causing an issue with connecting to your existing network. There are work-arounds for these issues. But using them may void the waranty on your TiVo.

My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).

I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.

Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.

Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.

The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.

Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.

Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.

I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.

This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.

I have been a devoted Intuit ""Quicken"" user since the DOS days of the program way back in the early `80's.  I have strayed a few times--once with Microsoft Money, and another time with a program whose name now escapes me, it was so long ago.  In the end I have always come back to ""Quicken,"" a program I consider the best personal financial program on the market.  I like ""Quicken"" because it allows me to seamlessly track all of my checking and savings accounts, (almost all) investments, and home inventory in one modular, easy to use package.  And I use Quicken to bank on-line, an added convenience that has made check-writing, bill paying, and account reconciliation so much easier.

The last time I upgraded Quicken was in at the end of 2009; that is when I updated to Quicken Premiere 2009.  I did so because Quicken 2005 was becoming buggy, and rather than re-install the program I decide to upgrade.  Also, I never like to be more then two versions behind, and; finally I hoped there would finally be an easy way to track U.S. Saving Bonds within the program; better luck next upgrade.  And oh, yes, one last reason: I got the software fro free through work.

I decide to go with ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" this time around because employees of the company I work for are allowed to download the software from Intuit for free, and because my version was becoming dated.

Installation

If you have a previous version of Quicken on your computer, the installation process will remove it completely, so be forewarned; i.e. back up your Quicken data to a separate directory before you start the install process.  There is a caveat however, one can use keyboard shortcut keys to install the new version along-side the old version and operate both at the same time.  I do not keep my Quicken data in the same directory as the program files, so this was not a concern for me.  And I always back up my Quicken data after each session.

At the end of the install, the program prompts you to upgrade the just installed software, and if you have internet access, I recommend you do so.  After the upgrade I started ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" for the first time, at which point I had the option to either start a new file or convert an existing one; I choose the later.  My Quicken 2009 data file was converted seamlessly by ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" without the slightest bit of trouble, for which I will be eternally grateful.

First Impressions:

As I stated at the outset of this review, I track all of my finances through Quicken; i.e. checking, savings, 401(K), investments, Saving Bonds (I have to improvise, there is no way to directly track Bonds in Quicken), loans, etc., as well as a household inventory via the Quicken Home Inventory module included in the program.  Some of my accounts are electronic and this feature still works well under ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" although one of my major bank accounts still cannot download transactions automatically.

One of the first things you'll notice is the new desktop home page.  The lines have been softened, and there is a new logical flow that is easy on the eyes.  My accounts are laid out on the left hand pane divided into account types.  The account can be re-arranged to suit you individual tastes.  But really there is not much difference between this and the previous version of the software.

Intuit brings back the Projected Cash Flow under the ""Spending"" tab at the top of the screen underneath the menu bar.  Quicken uses this area to give you a snapshot of money coming in verse money going out, by automatically tracking deposits from all accounts and bills.  I pay little attention to the area; it is nice to look at but I find its use limited.  Below this area there are a further three tabs entitled Scheduled Bills & Deposits, Account Balance Graph, and Spending Graph.  Again I see very little practical use for any of the areas, but they can be customized.

Other tabs across the top of the screen include: Bills, Planning, Investing and Property & Debt.  Again, I found little useful information underneath these tabs, but they are colorful and if you have a 401(k) the Investment tab might find some use.

With ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" you can set-up several account types, which the program divides up into four categories: Spending which encompasses the following account types: Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, Credit Cards, and Cash; Investments: Brokerage, IRA or Keogh Plan, 401(k) or 403(b), and 529 Plan; Property: House, Vehicle, and Other Assets, and; Debt: Loan and Other Liability (not a credit card).

Each account can be associated with a bank or banking institution and the usually account information added; e.g. account number, opening balance, bank website, interest rates, etc.

One-Step Update

Almost everything I do in Quicken involves the On-line Center (replaced by One-step Update in Quicken Premiere 2011).  Via the One-Step Update I can gain access to most of my banking and investment accounts from which I can download transactions in one step.  Once the accounts are set up, the account information is saved to the Pin Vault and thereafter I can download my most recent transaction into my account registers.  Once downloaded the transactions can either be accepted all at once or one by one.  This beats keeping a written register!

Conclusion

Is there a compelling reason to upgrade to ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" from previous versions of the software?  Not really, unless you need the specific functionality the software brings to the table.  There have been slight improvements to the interface and a few new features associated with business use, but overall the program is unchanged.  The minor changes hardly justify the steep upgrade price of $64.99 (Amazon.com price).

And where is my support for bonds, bonds, bonds?  Surely I am not the only one who buys and tracks bonds.  Bond, be they U.S. Treasury Department Saving Bonds, Treasury Bills, Municipal Savings Bonds, or Corporate Bonds, as an important part of any diversified investment portfolio.  Get it together Intuit!

Despite the continued lack of support for Bonds, ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" is still the way to go if you want to simplify your (personal) financial life without a lot of fuss.

I recently helped my brother setup Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  12 a while after he purchased it. I'll focus on the differences between the two.

With both installation on Windows 7 Pro was painless. The initial setup of 12 wanted you to do the training step which involves reading several pages from a publication. These are internal to the Dragon setup with several good selections. With 13 much of this is optional, but still improves accuracy and helps Dragon learn you writing style.

Dragon profile setup may be tedious, but I think it's worth it for the improved results.

In Dragon 13 literature there are 14 new or improved features:
1) 15% greater accuracy: I'm not sure how such a definitive number, but I believe it's improved.

2) Learning from sent email works with web clients now:
  I don't use the supported web mail clients - I'm an Outlook gal.

3) There is a new Dragon Vocabulary editor:
  I have not tried this yet. I'll share my experience when I update this again later.

4) Smart Format Rules Enhancement:
  I think 13 is learning my common usage and adapting. This is kind of subtle and I can't really tell yet if it's better than 12.

5) Faster Than Ever:
  13 does seem a little faster to me but it's hard to tell on different machines with different characteristics. My brother's PC with 12 is an older core duo and has 6GB. Mine is a newer core i7 with 16GB. It seems fast enough to me. 13 is supposed to evaluate the resources of a system and adapt Dragon to make the best use of even limited resources.

Easier setup is via several changes in requirements and the audio setup. All to remove or make optional steps that were included in the Dragon 12 setup. This makes it faster to get started but all three of these improve quality.

6) With 13 Dragon assigns a name to profiles:
  To name a profile you need to rename it later. In 12 you were asked for the name when creating the profile.

7) The somewhat tedious reading for 4 minutes isn't required any more:
  It does improve accuracy. My vision impaired brother struggled with reading the selection from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it took us nearly an hour to get through it. When we were done Dragon did very well with his distinct ""Down East"" Maine accent. While it's not required in 13 I think it made a noticeable improvement.

8) Dragon 13 no longer asks to adapt its vocabulary with documents/email at profile creation:
  This saves time but, again it is a step that benefits overall use at a less convenient startup. Document/email analysis can be done later.

9) Dragon 13 audio setup lets you just pick your input device:
  I used the headset that came with Dragon Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium  which works very well. 13 also works pretty well with my laptop's built-in noise cancelling microphone which 12 didn't support. I don't even recall the microphone setup steps on 12 so I think they must have been almost as easy. I'm happy to see support for the open source OpenOffice Writer V4.1.

10) The microphone check step is a short reading:
  Again I don't recall this step on 12 though I'm sure it was there too.

11) Dragon 13 has increased its support of web based applications:
  Support has been added for web applications like Gmail and added commands and support for all major browsers. I have not explored this too much yet. I'll update this review when I've learned more. Dragon is very impressive to me in the amount of voice control it readily provides.

12) The DragonBar has been redesigned in 13:
  If you have 12 and want to go back to the ""classic"" bar it's in there and supported. I like the way it autocollapses so it does not use more screen space than needed.

13) The Dragon Sidebar is now the Learning Center:
  Whatever they call it I like having it around as I am continuing to learn Dragon. They way it adapts to the context of the currently open application is clever and very helpful.

14) The interactive tutorial has been expanded:
  It now covers the Dragon bar, learning center and the Vocabulary Editor. I think the tutorials are pretty good, but I just jumped in head first. In 12 my brother tried the tutorial simulation. It was well intentioned but the tutorial didn't understand his accent. Seems the tutorials do not use the just created profile. They are there for those who want/need them and that's a very good thing.

So far I'm liking Dragon 13 with the included headset. It's a complex program with many aspects I hope to try and dig into as I find time to get beyond my present basic use. These include using the dictation transcription capability which I hope to use with the iPhone app.

Dragon isn't perfect - sometimes it can seem to get confused when I stumble over some words, and this can result in dictated text that is hilarious! When this happens and I try to continue while laughing the results can get even more funny to the point where I have to stop and walk away and regain my composure before continuing. Somehow I've come to really like those fairly rare times takes me into a laughing fit. I can't think of another program where I look forward to it going off the rails like this.

It seems to me that 13 appears more an incremental improvement over 12 than a revolutionary upgrade. If I had 12 instead of my brother I would probably just kept it. If you need the expanded applications control or need more flexible microphone capability then 13 may be a good move even from 12.

No, I'm not kidding or playing some sort of game, Sage 50 was actually Peachtree at one time and the box is nice enough to tell you so up front.

Does that matter?  To some it may since Peachtree, while a very capable accounting package, was notoriously difficult to work with and had a steep learning curve.  I can remember attending hours of classes just to get the basics down.
Fortunately, Sage is a bit better.  Even the initial installation is handled better with comprehensive instructions on how to do a network install versus a single computer setup, etc.  Your biggest decision will probably be where to park the data files.

Of note, the importation of Quicken-style and Excel files is much more evolved than it was in the Peachtree versions, at least from what I could see.  The last time I attempted an .xls conversion in Peachtree the end result was not pretty, but Sage just took it in stride.

The design is also better with a more manageable layout of tabs for different procedures such as banking, employee records, inventory, etc.  While this is a carryover from Peachtree it has been shined and polished a bit here.
As for the standard AP and AR functions, it should go without saying that setting up accounts is a snap with the biggest amount of time you'll spend being on the initial entering of information.  Once all that is established then entering future amounts and information is second nature.  I do like the ability to accept one check from a vendor and move it over several AR accounts, something I found a little tricky in the past (attempting to use one check number and then splitting it among accounts often led to some dicey moments in older versions).

So, why dump a star?  While the internals appear to have been tweaked and polished, the look most definitely hasn't.  Think Office 2003 if you want an idea of how this looks.

Is that necessarily bad?  Possibly not, but anybody currently using the program (but an older version) may see no reason to fool around doing an upgrade if nothing much has changed from their trusty standby.

There is a variety of ways that I can address this from the person who has never seen Painter before to the person who has used Painter since the days of its origin at Fractal Design before Corel bought it, and even those who use this for high end graphics production in text books, fine art, and gaming illustration.

I have decided to go about it from the perspective of what I am using it for and a brief history of my experiences and exposure to Painter.  I will also list what my computer is like, what I am using for a graphics device, and then as best I can what is new in the program.  I will submit this review and add to it as I can gather the information to provide for you.  This will not be short and sweet, because this program is very deep and intense.  I don't think you can justify a short review of it.

MY COMPUTER
Here are my specs

Intel Core i5 CPU 650 @ 3.20 GHz
Memory 6GB
OS- Windows 7 64bit
Input- mousepad and Intous 5 from Wacom

BRIEF HISTORY

I had the original Painter from Fractal Design back when it was amazing and a challenge to use,
but it put me ahead in light years for my artistry.  I have not only done graphic arts, but I am
a fine artist.  My primary use for Painter at the time was to use it for throwing ideas up
into the screen and trying out alternative colors and textures for my paintings.

Sometimes I would scan in my paintings or take a photo if the painting was too big and use
the program to test out ideas.  I even would do this for using it for very tiny details- the kind
that could greatly ruin a painting should I put it in the wrong place.

I work in watercolor primarily so I need something like this to test out ideas as watercolor is something
you can not retract once you have done it.  That can be highly frustrating when you have worked a long
while on a painting and you ruin it by doing one small thing at the end.

Painter helps me to avoid this kind of frustration.  For this, it has been a delightful tool.

I used to have the ArtZII pen and graphics tablet, but due to some awful driver issues, it suddenly
stopped working with Windows XP.  That meant that the Painter X that I had purchased was pretty much
useless to me and I never got to explore the program.  I could not afford another pen and using a mouse
was far too frustrating.

The old Painter was nice.  It gave the idea of doing artwork on the computer, but there was still a gap
between real time artist tools and what was in the program.  Still it was useful and I used it constantly
until my Wacom graphics tablet stopped working.

EXPERIENCE OF PAINTER X3

Since it has been some years since I have had the chance to use Painter, I have forgotten all of the wonderful
things it can do.

I now have the Intuos 5 Touch Graphic Tablet (Medium) from Wacom and let me tell you this program is so overwhelming
I feel as if I might drown there is so much in it.

When you first enter the program, there is an opportunity to get some training on using Painter X3.
You can opt into the training from the initial screen.  This will give you an option to go to the extensive
help files or go online to learn how to use Painter X3 for whatever your penchant is.

There are tutorials for Fine Arts, Illustrating, Photo Art, and Painter Interface.  Beyond that, there are
tutorials for doing specific art pieces provided by a variety of artists.  Some are for previous versions of
Painter, but they still apply.

HOW THE PROGRAM INTERACTS WITH INTUOUS 5

I am a bit overwhelmed with this program.  Not only am I dealing with all of the amazing improvements of the program
since I used to use it constantly, but the Intuos 5 is another whole breed of graphics pads.  Painter is designed
to work with the Intuos 5 graphics tablet, so you can do just about anything with it.

I love that when I am working with the pad you can zoom in or out just by using your fingers to expand or contract
the paper.  This can be turned off, incidentally.  You can turn the paper to just about any angle you like with your
fingers as well so the art creation experience is much more realistic.

There is a seemingly endless series of brush strokes and nuances that this pen and tablet capture that are very close
to duplicating the real life art experience.  There is the ability to take a thick line and draw it down to almost imperceptible
line that fades to a point just like in real life.

The new jitter brush enhancement to this program is delightful.  It more closely duplicates the way that paint or other media will
not be uniform no matter how much you have a steady hand.

SOME NEW THINGS THAT IMPRESS ME

The Jitter brush is one of the new features, and there is a brush search.  You can search based upon what you want- if you want only brushes that will jitter, then you can narrow it down by that.  I have not had any problems with this feature yet, but as I continue to use it over time, I will update.

There is a way to view an inspirational reference image while you keep focus on your current work. You can independently change the view of the docked panel without changing your work space or changing focus from it.

You can also control the minimum values of brushes like size or opacity.  Also, you have some bit of control of the settings of the jitter brushes.  I have not had a huge amount of interaction with this to find the bugs yet, but it sure is interesting to mess with.

Perspective guides are amazing to me- they are lines that appear so you can use them as guides when putting perspective in your painting or work.

There is also an ability to go back and forth between a clone image- you can apply some changes to the original piece that you are cloning as well as the work you are cloning to- going back and forth between them.

I have not been able to truly explore the layer application but now you can apply changes to layers simultaneously.  The small projects I tested it on worked well- again I have not come across bugs yet.

FINAL COMMENTS

I have to say that this Painter X3 release is so packed full of goodies that I can not even begin to rave as much as I want to in this limited space.  Using it with the Intuos graphics pad makes it so delightful that I am like a kid in a candy store with unlimited budget!

There are some frustrations with the Intuos- using this sometimes is a bit frustrating- the paper will go a bit too far left or right, or become too small or big and I have to mess with it, but I am not sure if this is the software in Painter, the Intuos 5 physically, or a combination of both.

There is so much in this program that I want to comment on but I will update this review as I have the chance to explore it more in depth.  I am truly impressed with it so far.  I am not naive, however.  Programs will have bugs or limitations in them and it is just a matter of time before I encounter one.  However, at this time, it is pretty solid in performance and I love using it.

WHO WOULD LIKE THIS PROGRAM?

--If you are a graphic artist who tends to want to do more ornate graphics, backgrounds or illustrations, you would most likely like this program.

--If you are a fine artist who wants to test out designs before you paint them, you will definitely like this.

--If you are a photo person who likes to dress up photos in a more artistic way, you will like this.

--If you have access to a decent computer with the ability to get a graphics pad, you will probably like this, especially if it is the Wacom Intuos 5

WHO WOULD PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS?

--If you have an older computer and graphics pad, you might not like this.  It takes some power to use. (Go bigger than minimum system requirements)

--If you are a dabbler, you will probably not like this program.  They do have a lighter version that might be better

--If you the type of person who has to feel the texture of the paper below your hand and experience the smells and performance of real media, you probably won't like this program.  Many of the artists I tried to talk into trying it, refuse for those reasons.

All in all, at this time, I highly recommend this program to any artist who loves the arts, anything that is geared toward working with natural media (pen and ink, spraying, painting, markers, watercolor, etc).  If you are delighted at being creative this program will give you more than you will probably ever use, but you will have a lot of freedom to create.

I was hoping it was a bit more like Photoshop for photo editing, never having used it before, but that's not really its primary aim (there are some functions there, but there are better products). This is more like a souped of version of Paint where you can take photos and apply different textures and filters to it, as well as touch it up with an abundant selection of different brushes and effects. The interface is also a bit dumbed-down, and it's missing some of the higher-end features of the full Corel Painter, and while that might sound off-putting, for those prospective users that are not professional artists and don't have years of experience, that actually works in your favor. There is still a learning curve with the software (I'm still trying to sort through a lot of the features and what works well with some images, but not with others), but it's nowhere near as daunting as Photoshop (or even the Gimp).

As something that sometimes comes across as a higher-end version of Paint, drawing tablet functionality is almost a must, and I've found it to be pretty good. I have an older (and decidedly low-end) Genius F350 graphics tablet and it worked well within the program. It's certainly not a great tablet, but to be honest, I can't really imagine using this program without one. If you intend to get the most out of this program on a desktop (or even a tablet without some kind of stylus), it's almost a prerequisite.

As for the technical issues. I had no problems installing the program (which I did from an external USB optical drive), nor have I had any issues with it crashing (running under Windows 7 64-Bit). If you don't have an optical drive, Corel makes the installation files available for download on their site, so that's largely a non-issue (which is important with more and more tablets and ultraportables not having them). I installed this on my desktop which was built for low power-consumption since it's on nearly 24-7. The CPU is a quad-core Celeron J1900, with 8GB DDR3-12800 memory and a 240GB AMD SSD. Performance is more than acceptable, although I'm sure a higher-end system would probably speed it up, but I have no complaints, even on my lower-end system.

All-in-all, Corel Painter Essentials 5 is a fairly inexpensive and functional program for those who would be more likely considered dabblers. It works well for casual users and doesn't require a powerhouse to run decently.

Although its not my favorite it is still a good game and great for people new to the series. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to the Lilac Inn by an acquaintance of hers named Emily Crandall. Emily's mother recently died so Emily's guardian, Jane, is staying with her until she turns 18. She invited Nancy because strange things have been happening at the Inn, and the adventure begins right when Nancy arrives as she's confronted by a mystery including stolen jewels, missing wills, exploding kitchens and plenty of excitement. I liked the plot because it was very straightfoward - find out whos behind whats been happening to the Inn. It does a pretty good job of keeping the player interested. Another thing I liked is that I felt like everything that I was doing was connected to the plot and had a purpose. The plot isn't as complicated as some of the other ND titles, but for a beginner it's a good introduction to how these games work.

CHARACTERS - 3/5: The characters are alright in this game - not very memorable. Out of the main characters, though, my favorite would have to be Jane. She was the only one with interesting things to say, and I really liked her accent. As for the rest - Emily was nice, a little boring, though, Topham was definitely fishy, and the banker, Jim Archer, was so forgettable that I forgot his name and actually just had to look it up on Wikipedia. The main characters are just average. But my favorite characters were Bess and George, as always, and the telephone operator. I kept spending all my money on the pay phone talking to them cause they were so amusing. Plus the people in town were also fun to talk to.

SETTING - 5/5: This is the only Nancy Drew game set in the 30's (as a tribute to the books). Her Interactive totally aced the 30's feeling, I really felt I was there. The music was great, real swingy and jazz like. And driving around Nancy's blue roadster was also lots of fun. I had to have delivered like 50 telegrams throughout the game just so I could drive around in it. The setting is just really well done.

PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles in this game aren't very hard. I'm not very good at puzzles, but I managed to figure out most of these on my own, which says alot. I only used a walkthrough on a couple of really complicated ones. A lot of other people had trouble with the mini golf game, but I don't remember that one giving me trouble. The only one I really hated was fishing. It took me like forever to figure it out, but once I looked it up I realized I'd been doing it all wrong. But for the most part the puzzles were all fun and easy, which I really liked because I never felt frustrated or bored while I was doing them.

IS IT CHALLENGING?: Not really. On a scale of 1 to 5 I'd give it a 3, mabye even a 2 if you're really good at puzzles. But like I've said before, this is a good game for first-timers.

ENDING - 5/5: I thought the ending was really great. I was a bit surprised by the culprit, which is good, and their motive was good. Everything made sense and there were no loose ends. Catching the culprit was also alot of fun once I got the hang of it. The ending isn't extremely thrilling or scary or anything, but it makes alot of sense with the plot, thats why I thought it was so good.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot - 4
Characters - 3
Setting - 5
Puzzles - 4.5
Challenge - 3
Ending - 5

 ""I like how easy to use the software is. One could start doing simple animations in a matter of minutes, even learning the how to use the more advanced animating features such as the animation bones, which allows you to freely manipulate limbs on your characters', shouldn't take more than an hour or so. The software also comes with pre-made character templates for getting started immediately, as well as a custom character making tool for quickly creating your own characters.

  What I dislike about the software are all the limitations. I understand that the Debut version is supposed to be the lesser of the two versions, but I felt that some of the limitations may have been a bit unreasonable. Everytime I had a new idea for a cartoon, there always seemed to be a new limitation preventing me from making it. You cannot make animations longer than 2 minutes, or greater than 3000 frames. You also can't add more than two audio tracks, despite how short they may be, making dialogue a very difficult thing to add to your cartoons. As well as many other limitations that of course are not in the Pro version. If you are serious about going into animation, it might be worth it to go for the more expensive Anime Studio Pro 8"".

It is a powerful suite of software used for a variety of graphic art, webpage design, flash animation, and more. It is not my intent to go over every feature the software package, since there are many outstanding reviews already posted. However, I would like to hit the highlights.

- When compared to Adobe Photoshop - as a pure graphics program it is tough to beat Adobe Photoshop. Most of us grew up using Photoshop and Adobe, so in many ways it is intuitive. The CorelDraw Premium Suite has many additional features which helps it to become a one-stop solution. In terms of price both programs are roughly at the same price point.

- What features do you need? As I stated above CorelDRAW is fully loaded suite of software - the question is - do you need it all? Will you need the video editing software or are you more comfortable with a rival program? Do you need to have the ability to create Flash media? If so.... by all means the CorelDRAW Premium Suite is probably perfect for you!

- The Video Editor - Perfect for YouTube and most video editing applications. While it may not rival Final Cut Pro it will serve the needs of a vast majority of your video needs.... now if you are planning to edit a full length feature film my opinion may be a bit dfferent.

- Installation - You can pick and choose the programs that you want to install.

Final Verdict - CorelDRAW Premium Suite is a very robust software package. The reason why I am giving it 5 stars is that it may not have the absolute best software for your application it does provide a VERY good option for everything and in terms of value that earns a 5 star recommendation from me.

From then on I went with H&R Block TaxCut, now called At home. I must add I have no idea why H&R Block decided to change the name. I still call it TaxCut. I can't remember the ""At Home"" name. To H&R Block, changing the name was entirely stupid and a waste of time and effort.
Now to this program, I am dissappointed by the decreasing quality of it. First, DeductionPro, an useful program for valuating donations to charity was included on the disc. Then, I used it. Over the last few years, H&R Block decided no longer to include it. Now one has to go to the website to look up the info. Unfortunately, the info can't be stored on their server-what's up H&R Block??? Aren't you supposed to make things easier for the taxpayer with your software? Why are you changing things to make it arduous to do our taxes?
As if this isn't enough; the Deduction Pro one is a minor issure, really, though an inconvient one. While running this program to do my 2011 taxes, I found there were several areas where H&R Block didn't provide enough information, or no information at all to help me choose the appropriate answers to complete my taxes. I actually had to contact both the IRS and my state revenue office to locate the necessary information. Also, the program is supposed to choose filing options and deductions that would be best for you. I found that was not the case. For my state filing, the program suggested filing jointly as the best option with the most deductions. However, out of curiousity, I chose both to see if there was a difference, and yes there was. In choosing ""combined"", I saved $30.00 more on my deductions. So much for H&R Block choosing the best option for me. That says a lot about this edition of H&R Block. It isn't what it used to be.

I would highly recommend you go through the tutorial that comes with the software (it takes about an hour), as it gives you a high level introduction of how to use it.

There is a slight learning curve of what you have to do when you're adding chapters, text within the chapter, etc. and if you're like me you have to go to the online forum where your question has probably been answered.  However, its all pretty straight forward and you can edit / switch stuff around to your hearts content.

After going through the tutorial, compiling an existing book that was originally in Microsoft Word didn't take that long at all.  What I particularly liked was the automatic generation of a linkable table of contents for Kindle-compiled books, but what I wish it had was a way to hyperlink to other pages / sections of your eBook.

However, this year the cost of e-filing went up and coupled with the price of the software is just too much in my opinion to spend. Based on some recommendations here, I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal Version (only) with Free e-file and since my state has a website to do the state taxes for free, I opted to do that. I am so glad that I read the reviews here because I never even knew that my state offered the ability to do my state taxes online .. and for Free! I couldn't be happier about the savings! As always Turbo Tax was fairly easy to use (took about an hour) and as it turns out my State taxes were easy too (took about 20 minutes).

1. Make sure your state offers the ability to do your taxes online and for free before purchasing this program.
2. Make sure you file your federal taxes first.
3. Then you can move on to your state taxes.

Side Note: In the state of Indiana, in order to do your state taxes on their website, it was required that I had filed Indiana state taxes in the previous year (this does not mean using their online ability last year, it just means I either mailed them in or efiled some other way for the state of Indiana).

When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller.

It was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.

He loves drawing and sharing his drawings which, lately, have been cartoon character sketches.  When I saw that Anime Studio Pro 8 had the ability to take sketches made on paper and turn them into easy-to-manipulate animations, I knew that I had to give it a shot.

Now, understand that I am a complete novice when it comes to computer animation.  I didn't know what to expect from this, and I was nervous that it might be difficult getting started.  However, SmithMicro provides a great getting-started tutorial that quickly introduced me to most of its main features.  After about an hour with this tutorial (which did NOT include animating paper sketches), I felt like I had the confidence to try to scan in and animate one of my son's sketches.

Success! Thanks to the tutorial's section on using a ""bone layer"" to to manipulate a sketch, it only take me about 15 minutes to scan a drawing, add some bones, manipulate those bones along a timeline, and export the animation to a Quicktime file (many other export options exist).  I showed my son, and now he wants to learn to do some of this on his own!

I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of what this software can do.  However, SmithMicro's website has many tutorials available (some are pdfs, and others are online videos).

The user interface is very simple and easy to operate, the controls are intuitive, and it pretty much is impossible to screw anything up.

Playback video quality seems to be excellent. At 1080p resolution I haven't noticed any quality difference from that of other media suites. The pictures are clear, crisp, and the colors are what you'd expect them to be.

Audio playback was less than stellar at default setting. By default, the audio decoding is handled by PowerDVD and frankly, when sending audio to my AVR via HDMI, it did a horrible job of separating the audio channels. The center channel was practically ignored and audio was sent to the front left and right channels instead. To fix this issue, I went into the audio settings and set PowerDVD to send non-decoded audio to my AVR instead of letting PowerDVD decode it. This way, my AVR was able to properly decode the HDMI audio signals and send them to the proper speakers. Audio sounded perfect after that.

First run of this program was less than confidence inspiring. As it worked to build the media library, which took nearly 8 hours to complete, the PowerDVD program would become unresponsive and freeze up extended periods. Once the media library had been built, the program has run smoothly and stably since.

Overall I'm very happy with this suite, and it does a better job than Windows Media Center for Windows 8.1 Pro, which tends to be buggy and not want to play various media sources without computer restarts and other nonsense.

Setup is awkward and confusing.  It comes with a single windows disk and a piece of paper telling you that you should go to norton's website.  There on norton's website, it asks you to create or login to your existing account, where it will present you with a ""device manager"".  You can ""add a device"" and select the type of device.  If it's an ios or android device, it will send you an email, with a link to their app in either the apple or android online store.  You download the app, launch it, login to your account, and it's up and running.  For a mac, it just downloads the app directly to your machine, and you can run the installer.

Most people with computers know what the norton suite traditionally does.  Mainly virus prevention and removal.  But it does something completely different for mobile devices.  First, it has ""anti-theft"" features.  You login to your same online norton account, and from there you can locate your device (brings up a map and shows you where it is), or lets you ""scream"" (make a loud alarm sound to scare the would-be thief).  It also lets you backup your contacts.

Also when you launch the app on Android it lets you run a malware scan, which also reports ""privacy risks"", which is actually kind of cool in that it tells you what information certain apps are collecting.

Windows 8.1 vs Windows 8.0: Why compare?  The upgrade is free and there is nothing but upside.

Windows 8.1 vs Windows 7: In my opinion, Windows 8.1 has all the functionality of Windows 7, and then some.  Some folks really seem upset at how the start menu was changed, but it took me about a day to adjust to that.  You can still find all of your apps using the same keystrokes (or mouse clicks) that you already used.  The ""look"" of the tiles popping up rather than a long list of apps has changed, but that's really it.  My advice - if you're already on Windows XP or later, ignore the naysayers and make the upgrade (assuming your PC is compatible).  Then give yourself a week of using it steadily before you pass judgment.

Windows 8.1 vs Mac OS: In my opinion, Windows 7 pretty much gave me all the benefits of the Mac OS (I know I'll get some negative comments for that, but I truly did use both and came back to Windows when they came out with Win 7).  So, based on my previous paragraph, I think Windows 8.1 compares well to the Mac OS.  Unless you're using Windows 8.1 in tablet mode, I don't think I'd go so far as to say it is vastly superior to Mac - only comparable.

Windows 8.1 vs iPad: This assumes you're using a tablet with Win 8.1 (I'm using a Surface Pro).  I tried using an iPad for a few years and other than playing games, surfing the web and checking email, it never seemed to be a great device for me.  I wanted something I could type notes into and even work on documents.  I tried adding a keyboard and apps that worked with Microsoft Office.  But just never seemed to quite work for me.  Essentially, I only did the kinds of things with my iPad that I would do with a phone.  With Windows 8.1 on a tablet device, I get nearly all the benefits of an iPad (though iPads do still have some advantages in tablet mode, such as form factor, weight and battery life - but none of those matter much if I can't be productive) AND I get all the advantages of a laptop PC.  And without lugging two devices all over the place.

Using Win 8.1, I dock my Surface Pro at the office and it is a full powered desktop computer with fullsize keyboard, mouse and monitor.  When working with clients, I have a small keyboard, or I have a stylus that allows me to take handwritten notes and draw pictures (this can be a big deal when you're consulting - a keyboard puts a ""wall"" between you and a client, and trying to use a stylus with an iPad to take notes was a non-starter for me).",Best of All Worlds OS As I'm Concerned,1393804800,2,

On the plus side, this operating system is probably necessary to take advantage of modern processors like the I5 and I7. Other than that, it has caused NOTHING but trouble.

(1) A laser printer for which I paid hundreds of dollars no longer works because its available drivers won't work in the 64 bit environment.

(2) Several programs, for which I paid hundreds of dollars in good money, work poorly even after selection of older operating systems in compatibility mode. Two other programs--one of which manages my address and telephone contacts--do not work at all.

(3) Intellipoint, the software for the mouse, asks me repeatedly to insert a disk every time I start it. I have to click on this totally irrelevant box (asking me to insert a disk) seven or eight times every single time I start the computer. Uninstallation and reinstallation (more time down the drain) did not fix this. A daily annoyance from a poorly designed product.

(4) The scanner is far less easy to use on this new computer.

(5) Windows Explorer is less easy to use in the Windows 7 version than it was in Windows XP

Conclusion: with the sole exception of higher processing speeds that are probably facilitated by the 64 bit system, this operating system is a step DOWN from XP. It does not appear to me that Microsoft put much foresight into making sure that the new OS would not render hundreds of dollars' worth (or more, depending on the user's applications) of software and hardware partially usable or not usable at all. As matters stand, I will probably have to pay about $150 for a new printer thanks to this operating system. (I am also not happy with the printer's manufacturer, Konica Minolta, which has not been able to develop a 64 bit driver, but Microsoft needs to keep in mind the need to make it easy for other suppliers to develop drivers.)

I previously gave this a 2 star rating. I just downgraded it to 1, worst possible, because it is now blocking me from installing antivirus software I need to protect my computer. I have spent hours fighting with ""permission"" settings and the registry--things most home and even small business users wouldn't know how to do--and the posted online solutions are absolutely worthless--which pretty much describes this Microsoft product. Bottom line: IF YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T NEED THIS TO RUN, DO NOT INSTALL IT.

I try not to visit suspicious websites; I never download attachments in emails unless I know who sent it and what it is.  That said, a lot of ""safe"" websites are full of adware, and even our best friends can pass along viruses without knowing it.  Years ago, our family lost two computers simultaneously to the same (particularly vicious) virus.  And yet I've never been too serious about virus protection.  If it came with the computer, and I could get a year for free -- great.  I'd try it.  Then I'd start to get irritated by the seemingly-constant ""update"" popups.  Virus software is serious about keeping you safe, to the point of almost being annoying.  After the year is over, I'm typically not in the mood to pay for continuing virus protection.  The result?  You'd like me to say I got a virus, right?  Nope, I've been without up-to-date virus protection for over a year, and I've been graced with nothing more than adware (which I remove manually using a free program I found online.)

Lately, however, both my desktop and laptop had been running slowly, and I got a bit paranoid.  What if they were both saddled with byte-eating viruses and I didn't even know it?  One thought leads to another, and suddenly I'm convinced I need Anti-Virus software.  So I get Norton, because the last one I had was McAfee and those little red popup messages drove me crazy (at least with Norton, I'd get a different color of popups, right?)  First, I installed Norton 360 on my 6-year-old laptop; the process was slow, and I'm thinking with the amount of hard drive space Norton takes up, it might not be worth it.  My 2-year-old desktop, on the other hand, handled the installation just fine.  The installation process was slower than I expected, but once Norton was up and running, I didn't have any problems.  It asked if I wanted it to scan my computer for badness, I said yes, and it found a handful of semi-malicious cookies.

According to the box, Norton 360 does everything that Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus do... plus more, including a feature for restoring deleted or damaged files on your computer.  They also give you 2 GBs of ""secured online storage service,"" with the ""option to purchase more.""  2GB doesn't seem like much anymore, does it?  Still, it's something, and if you don't already have your own webspace, you may want to consider backing up certain files online, in case of a house fire or something.

All in all, if you're already careful about what you put on your computer, you take care of your own cookies, you already have free adware protection, and you regularly back up your files your own way, you may be able to do without this.  But it's nice to have this stuff all in one package, and -- dare I say it -- it's even kind of nice to get alerts when there IS something suspicious going on, assuming you really care.  If you need an extra selling point, the box claims you'll receive ""free, unlimited 24x7 email and chat support"" from Symantec, as well as phone support.  There's also a 60-day money-back guarantee.  I haven't actually needed that support yet, but that's a nice promise.

Edit: After several months of using this product, I have a somewhat minor complaint.  Even when I turn off the protection (a necessity when playing certain PC games with which anti-virus software can interfere) and I instruct the program not to turn itself on without my permission, it turns on anyway.  I'm also annoyed by the pop-ups encouraging me to engage in Norton's online back-up storage feature.  I have my own webspace, I do not need this feature.  I'll turn off the alerts, but a few days later, they're back.  I thought Norton would be less intrusive than McAfee, but that doesn't seem to be the case after all.",Computer care is just one step away,1216252800,4,

It took a while to download onto my ASUS laptop which runs OS Windows 7, 64 bit  with 4GB of RAM. (I have since learned that this program needs a minimum 6GB of RAM to run on a 64 bit system)

This program really is easy for a beginner to put together awesome looking slideshows & movies. There are several templates, some free music which can be used to spice up your production...and some music that can be purchased or you can use your own music.  The first project I put together was a slideshow that used several photos. After saving that slideshow, I have never been able to open it again. It crashes the entire program each time I try. I don't know if I did something wrong in the process of putting it together or it's crashing because I'm using 4Gb of RAM instead of 6GB. (Each time the program crashed there was a pop-up which sent an error report to CyberLink).

My next project was a video. I previewed several templates before choosing the one I liked best. I  added music too. The video never crashes the program & always opens. It needs some editing, but I'm happy with my progress so far. I was even able to rotate the video which was upside down & was taken with an iPod Touch.  I really, really like all the templates that are provided in the program. You'll have access to 450,000 more free templates too. I haven't checked those out yet.

Learning to use all the features of PowerDirector 13 Ultra will take me some time. The Quick Start Guide wasn't overly helpful. However, there are tutorials on YouTube and  CyberLink's DirectorZone.com has a huge community of users and there's several online tutorials. There's access to over 450,000 free templates too.

Disappointingly, iWork '08 'Pages' performed better as an image-based page layout package for the multimedia center crowd, proving woefully underpowered in a professional business office ... crippled by the tediously awkward conversion hassle from  *.doc to  *.pages documents.

No more!  With iWork '09, Apple has virtually erased any remaining barrier to business office `switchers' still on the fence.  I have explored and tested Pages '09 since its online release as a downloadable fully functional 30-day trial demo.  I was so impressed with the new Pages (as against the flashy eye candy of the '08 version) that I ordered the full boxed version.  [The trial software is well worth a test run to see if iWork meets your needs.)  The new Pages now easily exports a document in doc, txt or pdf format, and does a remarkably lifelike transformation of even highly complex Word documents, tables, lists, or legal briefs with a mere double-click or drag-and drop.

Rather than spreading myself too thin, I limit this review to `Pages', leaving commentary on `Numbers' to spreadsheet buffs ... `Numbers' capabilities, in the past, were no match for the depth of MS-Excel.  If  `Numbers`  performs as well as  `Pages'  in this  iWork  overhaul, then the product will be the best eighty bucks gift for your Mac.  `Keynote', an image-with-outline presenter's tool, probably will prove at least the equal of MS-PowerPoint considering the Mac's flair for spectacular graphics.

`Pages' well may be the impressive turnaround software that elevates the Mac from multimedia center toy to serious professional business status.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.

The best you'll get away with is repurchasing Quicken every 3 years if you want to retain the online banking feature. I presently run the 2010 version which works well. I see no reason to upgrade and agree with some other reviewers that Quicken upgrades rarely improve anything or add useful features. However, I now get frequent reminders that if I don't upgrade by April I'll lose the online banking feature. That is blackmail! If I ever find a decent useful personal finance program that supports online banking, I'll switch in a second without looking back. Mint looks decent but it is now owned by Intuit and will soon become Quicken. I used Microsoft Money a long time ago and would still use it if it had not been discontinued.

It deserves only a 1-star rating, but I give it 2 stars because I've had a good experience with Quicken 2010 so far.

11/27/2013 update: I compromised my morals and upgraded to 2013 because nothing else looked very robust. Lowered to one star because the 2013 version is not any different than the 2010 version, yet I was forced to upgrade to retain online banking. Idiots. I'd really like to monitor anticipated income and expenses easily. I can probably do it with Quicken but it is soooo cumbersome and takes way too much time and thought to make it work. Microsoft Money did it well but that was many years ago. We've come a long ways backwards with Quicken. Quicken 2013 also doesn't like the Quicken Exchange Format that one of my banks uses so online banking is only partially successful.

2/8/2014 update: Yet another reason to hope that Quicken or someone else comes out with a better product. I anticipate a budget crunch in 2014 to pay for unforseen federal taxes so I started a budget under Planning. They've removed a feature that previously existed! I'd like to specify the starting month for my budget but I'm limited to complete Jan-Dec years. I don't consider defining a date range for a budget to be an advanced feature. Another thing I'd like to be able to do is enter paychecks in as bi-weekly, not monthly. That is not possible with Quicken 2013 Home and Business.

Intuit is slowly dumbing down Quicken to the point were anyone can use it at a very basic level at the cost of leaving experienced users in the dustbin. The problem with doing that is once people own it and try to use it for the purpose it was designed for, they become experienced users and start looking around for something better.

[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]

For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You ""have"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.

* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.

* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a ""reminder"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.

*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.

[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.

[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message ""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment."" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the ""Ignore"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.

[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for ""how many times"" from ""unlimited"" to ""1."" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.

[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.

[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.

[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]

[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.

[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.

[Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.

[Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.

[Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's ""one-step update"" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?"" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'

[Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.

OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says ""cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled."" Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.

Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has ""imploded"" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.

I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been ""used"" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.

Oh, and down in my tab titled ""Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due"" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are ""enter"" ""edit"" or ""skip"" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter ""skip."" Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.

I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's ""sunset policy."" Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man"" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!

[UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.

Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:

* Export the data from Quicken using the ""all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.

* When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the ""Import account info only"" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the ""original transfer balance in"" for one account.

After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.

Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.

The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first 'initializing' download for each account, no problems.

I haven't started using the 'setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.

It's pretty easy to install, and personally, on my own computer, I haven't really had a bad experience with Norton products on my own machine, which I try to keep updated with the necessary viral updates, upgrades and patches.

But, I've also seen Norton at work on other computers I've encountered. A relative of mine contacted me one day to tell me their computer wasn't working as it was supposed to, and asked me to take a look at it, which I did. The computer had one of the worst infections I've ever seen. It had over 100 viruses and malware weighing down the operating system. Completely mind boggling.

The thing was, this relative had recently upgraded their Norton Internet Security by buying a two year license for their machine, so it should have been fine.  To be honest, the relative isn't computer savvy, but even if they had downloaded a file, by mistake to their machine which ended up giving them a virus, there should have been some pop up or warning to alert them that the file they were downloading had a virus in it. The program is supposed to do that much. Instead, Norton was hijacked by the viruses. It kept me from executing and using the free, third party packages I needed to remove the viruses off the machine. It would alert each virus removal tool as a ""virus"" then quickly delete it.

It literally took one day of my life to get the computer working again normally, and nearly four days (over a two week time span) to get the machine clean. This took multiple scans. Luckily, I did not need to do a clean restore.

Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word ""camel"" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permit Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...), copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

My crew and I primarily operate MacBooks so our options for software are limited.  With the opportunity to try out Corel Graphic Suite X7 I handed the trials over to our artist/token PC user since X7 operates on Windows only and, so far, we've been impressed with his work while he's been intrigued over the ease of use and complete control over what he does.

The first thing we noticed is that the software doesn't require much in terms of system requirements so our friend with a relatively older PC was able install and utilize it with no issues.  It ran smoothly and was amplified by the fact that it's user-interface is very intuitive (has features where an artist would want them to be rather than require a treasure hunt to find) and user-friendly.  This saves a lot of time on production since no one likes to navigate through endless menus to find one simple feature.

After a week of playing around with the features our artists sent in his first samples and the results are nice.  Granted we're doing this for a youtube page and website, which the software seems grossly overqualified for, but it allowed our guy to crank out images and samples like none other and we're very impressed with the output.

However, one of the issues we ran into were that not all of us can read Corel images without sufficient patches, which weren't a problem but goes to show that one must be ready for PC-Mac interfacing if you're running any kind of business/project with a diverse collection of computers.

All in all, I can't say if X7 is better than Adobe or Photoshop, which are used by most professionals I know in the industry, but we're happy with it on our lower end of the spectrum as we inch our way upward.

This is the 15th consecutive year I've used TurboTax for our state and federal returns. Over that time, Intuit has offered some better (and weaker) versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.

If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped tame, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Tax time before TurboTax used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy).

I agree that this is expensive, but as an individual and not a business/professional, I know that this product was not meant for me.  This is Office Professional - it has a LOT of features.  It is not designed for users who are mainly going to only use Word and Excel.  That is what some of the other versions are for.

The biggest addition is the ability to link and share information via the web.  You can link docs, notes, spreadsheets, share presentations via the web.  Lots of capabilities to share and collaborate.

I love using OneNote.  I use it for a lot of things and I think it is possibly the most underutilized program in the suite.  People may think it is for taking notes in class.  I'm not a student - it can be really helpful for organizing lots of different types of information.  Now I can share my notebooks via the web, a feature that CAN be really helpful for students and non-students alike.

A couple of features I like is the people pane on Outlook integrated with the Outlook Social Connector.  This allows me to link my contacts to social networks (facebook, LinkedIn) and display information from the social network on the people pane.  So, when I open an email from someone who has a fb profile, I can see all their posted items, previous emails, facebook statuses.

The effects for photos and video are what you would use to just add a little something - you can add sparkle effects to part of a movie or tint it like aged film, or put a filter on a photo to make it look different.

The instructions that come with this software are about the process of making good movies and pics, as well as how to use software.  You can come in with no knowledge and get good simple instructions.

The software is also built around the basic home uses of sharing video and pics,  it even has a share online button in the video editor to upload to YouTube.  Planning for social media is important, because sometimes software will want to save in formats that are harder to share.  This software is fast and simple for your basic home uses,

The best person for this is someone who is already taking and sharing pics and videos, and just wants a quick way to boost how you can prep those files.  If you've used an Instagram filter to finalize a pic before you share it, or wanted to add some transition effects in a movie to give it a little more polish but do not want to spend a long time reaching perfection and nailing down details, then this software would be a good fit for you. In this case, the price difference for the Family version (this one) and the ""Professional"" version is very small.  So, look at the chart of features on Roxio's webpage to consider getting the pro version.  The most useful feature it adds is automatic audio clean up tools in videos, but also it has extra special effects for movies and a different tool for photo editing with more features.",A small step up on all your multimedia editing,1420156800,,

It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:

I received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.

There were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.

I'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.

If you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that.

The software doesn't install on the computer.  With the cost of storage being so low these days, and with effective compression algorithims for audio (.mp3) and video (.mpg) that reduce file size, there's no reason to create a software product that runs from optical disc alone.  Even on a fast PC I built (AMD Phenom II 1100T 3.3 mhz hexacore processor with 8gb DDR3-1600 RAM, running Windows 7), the product takes a long time to switch between features, either because of the inherent slowness of optical disc access times or because you have to swap discs out to use different features.

While this may not be technically correct, MapPoint appears from a user standpoint to be an enhanced version of Microsoft's  Streets and Trips.  Both can be used for plotting trips, and with a GPS adapter, turn your laptop into a full blown GPS. Using a computer to plan trips has a lot of advantages over a standalone GPS.  You can plan your trips and side trips on a large screen, easily save and edit them, and look up possible destinations on the internet at the same time.  The bad news is you need your laptop in the car when you do go on a trip and that takes up a lot of room compared to the standalone GPS. One nice feature is that routes created in MapPoint can be downloaded to some standalone GPS unit (mainly Garmin, check the MapPoint website at Microsoft.com).
MapPoint adds features that I feel will mainly be used for business. It has the ability send maps and data to Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).  It can also pull data from Office applications and SQL databases and use that data to create maps. Developers can program their apps to use MapPoint to generate maps that are incorporated into their software or websites.

I had no idea that there was an app that would connect my iPhone directly with my computer (it isn't using Bluetooth, so I assume it is using my wifi network), but it was suggested during the installation process. Genius! I was able to start my dictation training immediately, using my iPhone as the microphone, which comes so naturally!  The package includes a perfectly usable USB headset with boom microphone. With either, I quickly achieved near perfect dictation.

As I have learned over the past year using Siri, the hardest part of learning to do true text dictation, is true text dictation - period - You must think about every punctuation mark you use - comma - and remember to speak it aloud in your sentence - period. I'm told by experienced Dragon users (a colleague of mine has numerous scholarly articles and chapters to his name, as well as a second professional degree; he gives much of the credit to night shifts, and Dragon) that the pacing and punctuation begin to come naturally, especially as you watch your errors on screen.

In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.

Nancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...

This is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (""fictional"" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little ""toned down"" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).

Like the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.

While the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.

The cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her ""theory"" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).

Like the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.

The game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall ""castle"" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically ""royal"", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.

While the previous game is a close runner-up, ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"" and ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"".

This was my first experience with such software. This review was written using Dragon. My experience is limited to a few hours with this software.

Installing Dragon was simply a matter of placing the CD in the drive and following standard installation protocol. The package included a CD with the software, a quick start guide and a microphone headset. It loaded successfully on the first try and so far has shown no tendency to nag for registration or other issues. It does ask for permission to scan documents allegedly to improve performance of the software. I don't believe these are scanned for content but rather for language structure and complexity in order to improve the algorithms. These requests are generally non-intrusive.

My installation was on a Dell workstation laptop using a high-end Intel core I7 processor, with 16 GB of memory. After installation was complete it asked me to read a sample text in order to tune the recognition algorithm. It periodically offers to scan documents and emails for unique words which you may select and then speak to improve the recognition algorithm thereafter. After completing the initial configuration I opened the brief interactive tutorial. It gave examples of typical commands but seemed rather sparse. I would have much preferred a more extensive and guided introductory tutorial.

After the tutorial, I opened a Word document and experimented by cruising the commands as described in the learning center (a task bar which appears on the right hand side of the screen). It quickly became obvious that pace-of-speech was important in eliciting the desired response. You must use a clear and controlled voice. My normal speech pattern (fast and little mumbly) resulted in a high frequency of errors early on. I suspect this may improve as the software learns my quirks of speech.

The learning center is context sensitive to the active application. Navigation, editing and controlling commands are very specific in format and must be followed precisely. Experimenting with the Dragon commands available for each application will seems to be a fine way to learn your way around Dragon. The learning curve seems quite rapid.

The speed of response when dictating is impressive although the software will occasionally lag behind the speaker. Best results are obtained by continuing to speak and trusting the software, as the speech will drop into a queue and appear a few seconds later. It does require some practice to learn to dictate properly.

Last year, I was unemployed and the IRS offers so called free filing through various companies if your income is below a certain limit so I tried the free version TurboTax offered through the IRS.  When I told them I had a HSA, suddenly I was no longer able to file taxes through TurboTax even though I met the income limit.  A HSA is nothing complex, it's a savings account for healthcare expenses, but suddenly I no longer qualified for free filing. Instead, they tried to upsell me to an expensive version.  This seems like a scam.

This year, I elected to review this retail version of Turbotax and the question of whether or not I had a HSA was not mentioned at all.  Fine, maybe laws changed because of the ACA and HSA's no longer matter.  TurboTax wanted to charge an extra $39 to file taxes for my state which I declined.

For no particular reason, I decided to look through a tax booklet (not included with TurboTax) and it seems I was supposed to include a Form 8889 with my taxes to show if I had deposited or withdrawn money from my HSA.  Because of this I believe TurboTax filed my taxes incorrectly, and I will need to go through the hassle of making corrections to my return.

Looking at the back of the TurboTax box, there are four (!) different versions to buy but there is nothing saying which version you should use if you have a HSA. So being unable to find the correct version of Turbotax to fit your needs may cause your taxes to be filed incorrectly.  This product claims to be able to file a 1040A which I normally use, but the truth is, it's only good for a 1040EZ and anyone should be able to file a 1040EZ on their own.

This is the 14th year I've used TurboTax for our state and federal returns, and this version is as good as any Intuit has offered (some years have offered better user experiences that others).

Of the many changes that personal computing and online services have brought to our household, one of the things I appreciate most is the taming of the onerous chore of tax preparation into something much simpler. Tax time before TurboTax used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations and HOPING I had all the correct forms. TurboTax has turned three days of extended misery into a couple hours of compressed misery...but misery that is free of anxiety over math error and interpreting IRS instructions.  Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Happily, those days are far in the past.

This version allows you to prepare up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and updating (since January) has been were painless on a Windows 7 machine. Because I had data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and it smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year. It also easily handled two major changes in our filing situation.

With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Sweet. Error checking was painless, and --72 hours before the deadline-- efiling the payments due were also problem-free. Note that federal filing is free, but state efiling cost $19.95.

Importing W-2 and some investment data is a breeze, although several mutual fund entries had to be made manually. I found that switching between the interview and forms was less than optimum this year: the forms menu was touchy and hard to navigate accurately, and annoyingly, was not complete.

One huge oversight is that form 1040-V, which anyone who owes tax needs (although you can technically file without it), is apparently missing in action. It did not print with my return, and when I went to forms it is not even in the list, making a trip to the IRS web site necessary to manually find, print, and fill out the form. Strangely, the corresponding form for my state taxes did print with my return and was accurate. TurboTax also had an issue with my state taxes when it wouldn't accept an entry I made (correctly) from a 1099-R. It insisted a certain number (a state tax ID number) had to be seven digits long, yet the number (which the payer, Fidelity Investments, confirmed) was nine digits long on the 1099-R. TurboTax would not allow me to overwrite the field, and I had to write a cover letter to file along with my state taxes (which necessitated paper filing). The program also lacks a decent search function. I had a complex issue involving a payment taken as stock which I had to research completely on my own (the J. K. Lasser book is still a great tool to have on hand). I also find that for both the 2006 and 2007 tax years TurboTax is inflexible about keeping your files in anything but PDF format, which I consider to be a major inconvenience.

I'm unaware of the history/reason my software, which was released just a few months ago, is already replaced -- too many errors? recall? Not sure.

Anyway ... this is a decent piece of software, not great. I agree with a lot of the complaints on the Amazon reviews - no product support, virus protection lacks (lots of false positives), and reports are not terribly useful. There are also some problems registering the product - they *really* want you to buy a new box every time, for every computer, which always causes problems.

My big problem with Kaspersky is a hint of greed behind the product line -- anybody who puts excessive protections on their software, at the expense of consumer convenience, has profit (not functionality or customer satisfaction) as their #1 goal. This hunch is reinforced by their lack of support - after you buy it, they seem not to care if it works for you.

But my BIGGEST problem with this, is that anti-virus protection should be free. If Kaspersky really believes in investing energy into this product, they should make it free to consumers and charge for upgrades/advances applications (such as network and business accounts). The fact is, this is already the business model for the top rated antivirus softwares.

So here's my recommendation: Get a free antivirus. The best one right now, according to reviews of the experts, is Avast. I've never had problems with Avast (except that it wants to update too often, but it only takes a few seconds). I used to run AVG, and loved it, but the new version is too clunky, lots of crashes.

*Everybody* should be running a hosts file, which Kaspersky completely ignores. The best currently is ""hostsman"" (and yes, it's free too).

And for firewall, the most recent IT studies say that the Windows XP or Vista firewall works as well as any other. It's free, and chances are you already have it. If you're running Me, 2000, or earlier, try ZoneEdit (also free).

If you're running Vista, you may want to try some of their built-in safeguards. I tried Vista for a while, and went back to XP (too clunky). But if you're on Vista, it's got some pretty decent safeguards already, and may not work well with 3rd party software.

My bottom line is, the computer is a tool which I want to *work* when I turn it on, not spend time or energy cleaning up viruses or other crap, and I should have to spend a fortune protecting it.

I have used PSP 7 for many years while and really like it. Working with graphics is a small part of my regular work. Thanks to a good pal, I found out about PSP while it was shareware and kept up with version upgrades for a while. They were also relatively very inexpensive. Corel bought out JASC and I suppose they have improved the line, but is it a good value? I wonder. A side by side comparison looks to me like it has not changed that much over the years. The current version is very good, but I don't think it is really full-featured without having a pressure-sensitive pad system, which is easier to use than a mouse for this product. It also has some high-end system requirements, so be sure you have a PC (IBM or Apple) that meets or exceeds them.

This latest iteration offers a pure 64-bit version.  The features of the 64-bit version are generally the same as those of the 32-bit version.  However, it makes much more effective use of extended memory.  I ran this on a machine with an Intel Ivy Bridge i7 processor and 16 gb of DDR3-1866 memory, and it runs like butter even on the largest RAW image files.

In all, this is powerful photo editing software at a reasonable price.  As with any powerful software, there is a learning curve.  But there are aftermarket books that will help you with that if you're interested.

This game was released in 2005, and in honor of her 75th anniversary, this game was released. Its title comes from the first Nancy Drew book ever published, and the story itself is a mix of the first four Nancy Drew books ever published (""The Secret of the Old Clock"", ""The Hidden Staircase"", ""The Bungalow Mystery"", and ""The Mystery at Lilac Inn""). To add to the feeling of authenticity, ""Secret of the Old Clock"" takes place in 1930, the year that the book was published.

In this game, a young woman named Emily Crandall has asked Nancy to drive out to her Lilac Inn to meet her, saying she'd like her to do her a favor. This takes Nancy by surprise, as she doesn't really know Emily aside from their mutual friend Helen Corning. However, thoughtful as she is, Nancy accepts.

When Nancy drives out to the Inn, she meets Emily's guardian Jane Willoughby, who is legally responsible for Emily now that Gloria Crandall (her mother) has passed away (her father died in battle years ago). Jane tells Nancy that Emily has been acting strangely, but Nancy dismisses this, thinking that she's probably full of grief and stress after losing her mom and trying to run the inn on her own.

Nancy goes upstairs to meet with Emily in her room. Emily tells Nancy that she'd like her to lock her mother's jewelry up in a safe, to keep it safe from all of the ""weird things"" that have been happening around the Inn lately. Nancy's curiosity gets going about these ""weird things"", but she has little time to ask before the stove in the kitchen ignites!

Nancy, Emily, and Jane all run out to escape the fire. The fire department arrives in time to save the Lilac Inn, but not in time to save the stove. With the stove gone, the Lilac Inn will no longer be able to serve its famous pies, meaning it could have to shut down for good. Not only that, but the priceless jewelry was stolen in the midst of it all!

All of the financial trouble that was happening in the 30's (the game takes place right before the Great Depression) and lack of a stove makes Emily blurt out that she wishes Josiah Crowley - a rich old man who'd recently passed away - had left her money in his will like he said he would. When Nancy asks about this, she learns that Mr. Crowley had promised he'd leave various people who he cared about money when he died, but when his will was found, they were left nothing and all of his belongings went to an ESP expert named Richard Tompham.

Just what happened to the jewelry? Why did the stove ignite? Is the will that was found the true will of Josiah Crowley? If so, why would a sweet old man like him break his promises? Nancy's now determined to find out the truth by solving her first case...

The storyline is pretty strong, and actually flowed very impressively, which I imagine would be hard to do when combining *four* stories into one. The mystery does eventually branch off into two or three different cases in and of itself, but it's actually all weaved together rather nicely by the end. The ending was very good, and I really can't complain about how things turned out at all.

I rather liked being able to explore and sneak around the Lilac Inn, as well as a few other places, like Josiah Crowley's old house (now inhabited by Topham) and the town's bank. This is also the first game to use the driving feature, which gives the player the ability to ""drive"" around Titusville (the name of the city the game's taking place in) by controlling the car from an areal view with their mouse. I had mixed feelings about the driving feature, as it does get hard to control and it's possible to lose the game if a flat tire isn't properly taken care of.  Still, it was also a cute little feature that was fun to include in a game. I do miss seeing everything from Nancy's perspective, though...

The puzzles were fun, and I liked the majority of them, but some of them were pretty hard to get through and felt like they rewarded little. The golfing challenge in particular was extremely hard to get through, and I'd say I spent at least a good half hour trying to win that section of the game alone. The sewing challenge was also pretty hard the first time around, but I felt it was easier once I got the hang of it.

Since the game does take place in 1930, there are lots of modern luxuries that were in previous games that did not appear in this game. For example, Nancy doesn't have a cell phone, and has to drive back to the Lilac Inn to use the coin phone on the porch whenever she wants to make a call. The phone friends in this game were nice, and this is the first (and so far, only) game in which Nancy has the ability to call her dad for hints and insight into the case. I really liked having Carson Drew in the game, and I'm hoping he makes his second appearance soon.

Speaking of the coin phone - that's another new feature employed in this game. This is the first game to employ the use of money, and Nancy must pay to get various tasks done (i.e. paying for more gas, buying things for other people, etc.). It's possible to run low on money, but Nancy can also drive around town delivering telegrams in exchange for some money. Delivering telegrams can get tedious at times, but the small conversations that are always sparked between Nancy and the person she's delivering the telegram to always brought about some comedic relief. Some of them were actually pretty funny.

The characters were well-integrated, and all seemed to have good reason to be the culprit. I wasn't sure who necessarily would be the culprit at the end, but there was enough to make me suspect everybody at times (even Emily). The culprit choice was actually rather surprising, and employed a move that'd never been used before when explaining the culprit's motive. While some may have their doubts about this, I felt it was rather nicely written into the story and made the game even more unique.

The suspects in this game include Emily Crandall, a 17-year-old orphaned girl who seems to have been losing her marbles ever since her mother died and feels like she's incapable of running Lilac Inn. Jane Willoughby was Gloria Crandall's best friend from years ago, and is currently acting as Emily's guardian until she turns 18; she's trying to convince Emily to sell the Inn thinking that she should take advantage of her youth while she still has it. Jim Archer is Emily's banker who seems to be a little evasive about the situations going on at the Lilac Inn, and also thinks Emily should sell the Inn before the bills start getting too high. Richard Topham is Josiah Crowley's former ESP trainer who's residing in Josiah's old house, who's inherited all of Crowley's belongings and views the Crandalls and Mr. Archer as selfish people who only loved Josiah because he had a lot of money.

""Secret of the Old Clock"" has a rather nice selection of music. None of it was my own personal cup of tea, because I prefer scarier music. The game does feature some nice 30's music, though. All of it complimented the game itself, and I think that the soundtrack really couldn't get much better than it already is.

Is ""Secret of the Old Clock"" as strong of a game as most of the classic 13 Nancy Drew games? No. I do miss seeing everything from Nancy's perspective, and some of the puzzles and challenges were very hard and frustrating. However, is it a bad game? Most definitely not! The story is wonderful, and I really liked the cast. It still features more first person exploration than a lot of the more recent games do, and it still holds the feel-good ""classic Nancy Drew game"" feeling that the first 13 games had. While this wouldn't be my top recommendation for a Nancy Drew game, it'd definitely still be high up in my gaming recommendations, and should be played by anybody who wants to play all of the ""good"" Nancy Drew games or those who want to take a blast into the past and catch a cunning criminal by finding out the secret surrounding the old clock. :) 4 stars for this gem of a game!",Travel Through Time to Solve a Case Surrounding It!,1310601600,2,

So, you have a laptop computer and you need a GPS for your car. Hey! For way less than $100 I can get this piece of software and get going somewhere. I'll have all sorts of travel info and map guidance and it'll be great.  Not so fast Sparky....

First you need a peppy laptop. Otherwise you'll be waiting a long time as it grinds out your information. That's your laptop, you say. Good, so let's go. This program installs and updates just fine. Now take the laptop down to your car. Got an empty seat, cool, we're going it alone. OK you won't really want to ask you passenger to have a laptop on their lap all trip long, right? Next we install the GPS unit and remember to use the enclosed extender. You may, most likely will, need a longer cable so the sensor can rest on the top of the dashboard. Next you program your destination and the GPS acquires satellites and off you go. In a word, clunky. It works but having a laptop on the seat next to you is at the very least DISTRACTING. If you're planning an RV trip and have a full time navigator with you. They can man the computer and help with guidance. Cool, this is for you. For the rest of us a dash mounted GPS is soooo much better.

The product works but I can't recommend it. It's fine for fun mapping, but as an actual vehicle GPS it fails. It's too dangerous to use. Imagine your laptop flying around in your car in the event of an accident. Not good.",This really tells you why you need a real GPS,1265846400,2,

As a result, many people have chosen to pick brand names over service. While I have at one point used brands like McAfee and Norton for protecting my computer from any viruses or spam. I did because it worked well back than. But now and then, it doesn't actually work as strongly as it has claimed to have worked, and that has left more of vulnerability than met the eye. That hasn't changed, and with Norton Security Deluxe, it has had the same flaws where it doesn't work strongly, and takes too much room on my computer hard drive to where it doesn't run as smoothly as my computer once did. As a result, I removed the program, and switched back to Bitdefender which worked more flawlessly on my computer, and didn't clutter it with any faults. Overall, if you really have the office space on your computer, than you'll really want to get more of a brand name like Norton.

In retrospect, I should have bought that one but Norton can be confusing to buy. I should knock off a star for that confusion, but over all, I can recommend this software. As it is, I've rated it four stars because really, the Premium is the one I should have bought for a few bucks more. If you cover your phones and your tablets, you'll need 10 device capacity, no doubt about it.

I also should knock a star off for installation: I broke a regular rule of mine--de-install before installing new, but I followed the on-screen directions and it didn't say to do that. However, as I was upgrading from the 2015 and a different version (I had premium before, see how confused I got?) I should have de-installed. To upgrade from 2015 to 2016 SAME product (ie deluxe to deluxe or premium to premium) you don't need to de-install. It's hard to remember what you did previously and the words ""deluxe"" and ""premium"" are easy to confuse.

So I had to chat with the tech support when my install ground to a halt. I couldn't proceed. Something seemed wrong--and it was. The chat person (possibly out of Palo Alto) was absolutely marvelous. We stepped through the re-installation after de-install by having her do remote-PC and at several points, watching the chat for when you have to re-enter your password (encrypted) because the tech can't do that, nor should they. It did take the 45 minutes she told me it would, and afterwards, my install was perfect--because it was handled by Norton. I give five stars to the tech support chat and no stars to the installation protocol, which should have checked for previous versions and suggested de-installation.

I did feel kind of stupid, but then last week, I did a flawless hardware malfunction diagnosis and repair on my same laptop so I guess ""D'oh!"" and ""Woo-hoo!"" canceled each other out.

Bottom line: Unless you have to save that six bucks, buy the Premium. You will be happier. Check previous versions of anti-virus. If it isn't the same product, de-install the old product before installing this one. I actually believe that would apply to competing software as well.","5 devices is skimpy, buy the Premium version",1465603200,6,

I finally got fed up with this version after having issues with their support to be able to reload the software again on a computer that I updated software on.  For some reason, the update caused an issue and I had to remove the software.  When I went to load it back on, I was told I had already used my three installs.

That is somewhat strange since there are very few reasons to use Entourage other than to use it as an Exchange client.

The Exchange compatibility has become important because most corporations use Exchange email. Moreover, most smartphones, including the iPhone, allows Exchange compatibility in which a user can synchronize contacts, calendar, and email with Exchange email accounts at no extra charge (Exchange email account is required). This allows seamless synchronization between an Exchange client (Outlook in Windows and Entourage in Mac) and smartphones such as the iPhone. For example, a user who updates a contact, calendar, or email in Entourage will also notice the same changes in the corresponding iPhone and vice versa. Unfortunately, the Entourage that comes with this package lacks this very feature because it doesn't support Exchange email.

The good news is that Snow Leopard (next Mac OS due in September of 2009) has a native Exchange email support built in. So you will no longer need Entourage to use Exchange email and its synchronization capabilities.

The Mac Office 2008 supports all Office 2007 formats (.docx, pptx etc). It does NOT support VB scripts. So any Macros using VB will not run on the Mac Office 2008.

There is a definite lagtime when using the Office 2007 format on Mac Office 2008. My guess is that it takes a lot of CPU processing to convert the Office 2007 format to the Mac Office 2008 format. Office 2007, which I also own and run on Vista (using Bootcamp), is far more responsive and is more user friendly. The Mac Office 2008 appears to be a stripped down version of Office 2007. You will be able to use, however, almost all the features normally associated with MS Office on the Mac Office 2008.

As of this writing, the Mac Office 2008 does NOT support Windows Live. But there are plans by Microsoft to enable Mac Office to use Office Live in the future.

First of all it is a separate program, it is NOT integrated with PaintShop Pro.  FaceFilter is also the ""standard"" version not the ""pro"" version and thus you'll be frustrated and wanting the more expensive pro version.  The standard version lacks a *lot* of the overall features and basically is *only* for tweaking faces (and they should be more or less straight on angles) and is limited to 1920x1920 resolution (pro version can handle up to 6000x6000 pixel images).

PaintShop Pro X7 itself is a very well designed and capable photo editing program.  The only serious flaw I don't like is that often when I switch from ""manage"" to ""Adjust"" to ""Edit"" modes I end up losing my edits because it has switched me back to the original photo rather than the one I was editing in another mode!

Like a lot of people, it was very frustrating at first to know how to do anything until I discovered this was just a shell built over Windows 7.  In fact, you can escape the top layer shell with a single click.  What I really like most is the Netflix App (the trendy name now).  So easy to watch multi-chapter movies now.

Boot up is astonishingly fast - less than 15 seconds with an old Intel 80 GB SSD from a full power off state with a low cost HP desktop computer with an AMD processor.  I've never witnessed anything like this speed previously, probably three times faster than Windows 7.  I have multiple other computers in my house, but the one I have dedicated to my HDTV was well worth upgrading to Windows 8.  I am not in a rush to upgrade the others yet, especially since I know it is still Windows 7 under the outer shell.  But am I glad I upgraded the computer that is my connection to my television and the internet.  I only paid $15 directly to Microsoft for the upgrade.  But I got too cautious and didn't buy any more upgrades because I didn't like it at first.

It takes a week or so to get the hang of these boxes across your screen.  I wish they allowed the old familiar icons instead of the boxes.  Now it is just boxes and text inside - not very appealing.  Seems retro to the 1980s, not a leap forward.  But it still works.  You have to do a Google search to learn how to do anything even basic.  This is a start over as far as the outer shell is concerned.  But you can easily drop down below the outer shell and you are right back to the Windows 7 look and feel.  Well, the Control Panel is really different.  I don't much like the new way either, but it is still there more or less.  I think they are copying the Apple Tablet style where there are zillions of individuals creating Apps and charging money.  I am not one to pay for the apps.  So far I can find all the things I want for free.

Other than the fast boot speed and the all the boxes on your monitor, it is still pretty much like Windows 7 underneath.  One minor annoyance.  You have to pay $10 to get the Windows Media Player that was free in Windows 7.  You can't play a DVD without it.  Well, you can - just not so easy.  You'll end up buying like did, but you won't like paying for it.  It is like Outlook used to come with Microsoft Office.  Then they split it off and charged the same price for Outlook as the entire Microsoft Office package cost.  Essentially they doubled the price if you really wanted Outlook.  Gripes me.  Divide products and double the price to get the same thing.  Thankfully I kept all my old Microsoft Office 2007 products with Outlook included.  I'll never upgrade.

I would often let the answering machine take the call and then I would return it once I was able to bring up the customers history including emails. Now it is all integrated into QuickBooks; smart move Intuit.

Of course they are in to it to make money. (No pun intended) so payroll now includes paying only 1 employee instead of 3 like it used to. It is now $2 per employee, per month for each additional employee. However that is a lot cheaper than a payroll service.

For those who are angry at Intuit for the challenges of setting up the installation, all I can say is what else is there? Hey I get frustrated like the next guy but I have been using Intuit products since their inception. (I am an old late 80s DOS guy to start) They have always been way ahead of the curve in making easy to use intuitive products; hence the name Intuit. I was frustrated with Qbooks 2013 in the colors they chose to display. It was hard on the eyes, next to 2010, but then they corrected that pretty much with an update.

I love QuickBooks. I have been running my company with 2010 QB Pro and there isn't anything I don't love about it. I could get critical and say when I am sending a customer an email it locks me out of being able to go anywhere else other than that window. That is one of the advantages of 2014 thanks to its greatly enhanced email functions.

QB 2014 also sports a calendar with reminders. I often use my tasks option in Outlook for running my business. So doing this in QuickBooks will seem like second nature to me.

QuickBooks in years past kept me so organized that when I got into a dispute with a business associate over some numbers he was blown away at how easily I could provide reports that substantiated everything I was saying. Consequently I got paid for what we agreed I would be paid for.

One important tip is that if you are running more than one business you may want to keep your old version as well. Be sure and back up your company files before loading a new version. When loading any new version of QuickBooks it asks you if you would like to keep the old version, or overwrite it. I keep the old version AND I choose not to have my company file updated to the new version. That way I can keep two versions of QuickBooks open at the same time. It is tedious to have to close one company, and open another every time a customer has a question. So by having two versions running concurrently, you can click on either tab and have instant access. You also can have one version running on one machine, and another version running on another if you have more than one person in the office, and each one assigned to a different company.

Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The ""ghost train"" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.

The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.

There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the ""make your own sandwich"" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.

Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it.

My desktop is hard wired to the network. I brought it out of the sleep mode only to find that wonderful yellow exclamation point on my hard wired connection. Of course, I knew immediately that it was the Kaspersky NDIS 6 filter, which I immediately disabled, and that ended the dropout problems on both computers. I have been installing this program on many of my new builds, and now I have to go back and correct this problem on all of them, because Kaspersky can't seem to find a fix to either of the above problems, and I do not know what exactly it is that this filter does. Because of their poor customer service, and their total lack of interest, I do not recommend this program to any user running both Windows 8 or 7. Kaspersky, you have lost a long term customer. I have switched to Vipre Internet Security 2014, totally because of your lack of interest, poor support and no fixes for long term problems.

This is a copy of my answer to their last email to me.

It really does not matter to me now if you fix the WIFI dropout problem
with your NDIS 6 Filter, and having to hit ALT +N to activate the Pure
software, and because of your lack of interest in repairing these issues, I
have uninstalled the software and switched to VIPRE. So as far as I am
concerned, you can close the ticket, and you have lost a customer for
good. You know, these issues have gone on for months with no
resolution, and I build 20 to 25 extreme machines per month. Since you
obviously have no interest in repairing you software, I will make sure
this issue gets around the industry.

I have authored DVDs with other software programs, created titles, added subtitle tracks to movies, combined sources from multiple input media. I have tried Roxio Creator 10, Windows Movie Maker and a range of freeware applications. My objective in this case was to capture, contrast and compare a specific group of scenes from three versions of the same film and burn the files to  DVD with menuing and commentary. I tried to duplicate the same procedures in each of the software packages, starting with WMM and concluding with ULead.  My impressions were ULead was not any more difficult to comprehend than the others but it did offer more flexibility and enhanced features that resulted in what I consider to be a superior end product. I cannot discount that `practice' with the other packages may have rendered this software more intuitive however, I found the GUI as easy, or easier to understand and follow than WMM or Roxio, and I elected to use video editing in lieu of the wizard feature.

While I only gave it a cursory overview, I happen to be a stickler in some areas like documentation so the inclusion of what I consider to be a thorough user manual - albeit in miniscule type size- rather than requiring the user to log on to a website and download huge PDF files is a big plus in my opinion.  On the other side of the ledger however, I could not register the product as I received a pop-up error message informing me I had attempted to register a `legacy version' that is no longer supported.

I did have some installation issues, not with the process itself but rather with outcomes. Installation procedure automatically hijacks default status for copying/playing DVDs, all image display, and contributes to performance degradation by installing at least three start-up applications InterVideoDVD (and this is WinDVD8 while 9 is the current standard), CorelPhotoshop monitor and calls Quicktime, if it is already on your hard drive. It is not an uncommon practice among software creators, what is uncommon here is I do not recall seeing an option during the install to maintain my current default programs. This application seems precariously close to bloatware in my view. I have 4GB of memory, or 3Gb or relevant memory with Vista but when this application is open I cannot run any other  background activities that require higher resource allocation like Outlook. One major sidenote, any program that starts off with the advisory you may want to double cache size is by definition a resource hog. While the system requirements indicate this software will work in a 512mb environment, I think anything under 1Gb is just asking for frustration.",making Moviemagic,1218758400,2,
8350,3,False,"11 25, 2013",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B00EZQYC8G,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},Raul G.,"I recently switched from Norton 360 Multi-Device to Norton Internet Security and have been using the 2014 version for about one month. Coming from a more robust version of Norton's anti-virus software to this version has proved an easy transition though not one without hiccups.

--------------------
INSTALLATION:

I received the physical disk format, however, after installing the disk and starting the installation wizard the recommended method was internet download... go figure. So I went along with that route and very quickly >15min downloaded and proceeded installing my software. Strangely the first time I entered my authentication code Norton's site indicated that my code had been previously used. I tried the code again about 20 minutes later and it worked. I should mention that if you have any anti-virus software already installed you should go ahead and uninstall it anyway as Norton will prompt you to do so.

Note that you will be prompted to create an account Norton/Symantec during installation.

--------------------
USE:

The Internet Security user interface (UI) is very familiar to me. It is basically populated with some easy to identify tiles: 'Secure' (color coded to indicate threats on your machine; green = good; 'Scan Now' which brings up a sub-menu for all types of system security scans; 'Live Update' for downloading the latest security definitions and patches; 'Advanced' for configuration. The tiles also display pertinent information including CPU usage (monitoring for spikes which are an indicator of a potential rogue application) and even when the latest definitions were downloaded and installed. The UI is good, easy to navigate, and unobtrusive.

I have this software installed on 3 machines - my primary desktop that has a SSD, 4-disc RAID storage array, and a networked NAS; along with two laptops all running Windows 7. I've found that Norton has done a great job on each system. Scan times vary, however, on my 300Gb SSD a full scan takes approximately 40-minutes for reference.

As I was already and have continuously used anti-virus software I didn't find any surprises on my systems after running my initial post-installation scans.

--------------------
USAGE NOTES:

It's perhaps just my impression but it seems that software companies tend to treat their customers a bit poorly on licensing. Norton is no exception. This software is licensed to you, you don't ""own"" it rather than lease a window of operation. That's fine and something that we've all sort of become accustomed to, however, the major problem is that this software will stop operating completely once it's 365 day operating license (the day you activate the key) is up. Prior to 2010 (as far as I can remember) Norton software would at least keep functioning outside of the subscription period though obviously not getting new updates and definitions.

The bottom line, and this is true for a lot of software and particularly anti-virus software is that you're going to have a costly bill due every year whether from Norton, Trend Micro, McAfee or whatever security company. You can mitigate this somewhat by buying last years anti-virus product. As long as the activation code hasn't been used you should be good to go. Remember that your license period doesn't start on the calendar year but only after the key is activated.

--------------------
ISSUES:

I don't usually install a lot of extensions in my browser but for some reason went ahead with Norton's Internet Security extension. This was a mistake! I'm a Chrome user and noticed that my browser immediately become slower, and prone to frequent crashes that killed every open tab. I had nothing but issues with the browser extension so I do not recommend using it, especially if you're a Chrome user!

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

Norton delivers another solid release of their seminal anti-virus software. Performance is good, obtrusiveness is kept at a relative minimum. Be wary of renewing online through Norton as you'll always pay top-dollar. Recommended with caveats.",Norton Delivers Solid Software,1385337600,19,

We had just moved long distance and left all our old TVs behind since the moving company refused to move them. The new TVs we purchased in 2011 (Vizio) had apps on them. What that means is on the TV there is a menu to select that allows you to use an Amazon or YouTube or Netflix and other apps to access online content on your TV. What this CYBERLINK product does is that same thing but as an external device.

However, we can take our laptop, move it near the TV, attach a $20 HDMI cable to link the two, play the content on the website (i.e. NetFlix, Amazon instant streaming movie rental, YouTube, etc.) and it plays on the TV.

A good thing about this is you can link to a mobile smart phone or an iPad or tablet and show your photos (or do any of the internet media playing). That is cool but it's something our family never wants or needs to do.

Because we have app enabled TVs this was an overkill, unnecessary product for us. People with older TVs which do not have apps may like this. However they could do much of the same thing with an HDMI cable and a laptop.

I would say I am a beginner/intermediate CAD user, so the first thing I look for is software that's easy to use and fairly intuitive.

It is compatible with DWG files as well.  From a beginner's view, I liked how it didn't seem as clunky as AutoCAD.  Although advanced users might want more options, I appreciated a program that had all of the basic design options and tools that I needed without forcing me to learn a bunch of new stuff. This is the main reason I still do graphical design with Paint Shop Pro over Photoshop. I did several basic models and worked on some imports and noticed little feature difference between CorelCAD and AutoCAD (for my purposes anyway).

I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new or improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server. When coupled with Offline Files & Folders (a features that the non-Home editions of Windows offers since XP), you can easily take your server data with you, even when you're in a disconnected state. Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY (including XP Mode)
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program. You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want. For truly stubborn XP programs, the Professional edition offers XP Mode -- a fully licensed, virtualized copy of Windows XP. Note that your hardware must support virtualization for this to work.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. While not appropriate for corporate use, this is great for the home.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Upgrading advice:  I went through the upgrade process twice.  Here's what I learned to do before and after the upgrade:  1)  Remove Adobe Reader and reinstall the latest version (9.2 as I write this) after the upgrade.  Older versions of Reader won't render correctly in Windows 7 and an IE8 browsing session.  2) Remove your antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spyware programs, and reinstall them after the upgrade using the latest versions available.  3)  Remove any virtualization programs (like VMWare Workstation) and reinstall following the upgrade.  4)  After the upgrade, look for the latest video driver from the video card maker, not by your computer hardware vendor (in my case, it was getting a new driver from Nvidia rather than from Dell).

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk?  You can, but here's how.  Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install.  During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet.  Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7.  Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7.  After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows.  I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully.  Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route.  Final note:  This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer.  If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version.  As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing.""  :-)

And finally, my few quibbles with Windows 7:  My Dell XPS M1530 has always had sporadic issues resuming from a sleep or hibernate state under Vista.  That still is the case, even with Windows 7.  I'm not convinced, though, that the underlying problem is an operating system issue as much as a hardware/BIOS problem, so I can't knock Windows 7 for this problem.  Not all my laptops have had similar power-on problems, even under Vista, so my advice to you is to NOT expect Windows 7 to solve any power-on problems from a sleep or hibernate state if you've currently got those problems with your laptop.

Lastly, if you like to periodically examine the Reliability Monitor in Vista, it's not as nice in Windows 7 -- there is no precise data value assigned to your machine's ever-changing reliability metric.  And it's impossible to find in the Control Panel (but it's easy to do a Start Search on).  The graph is still there, though, and it's updated hourly instead of daily.  For most people, I'm guessing this is a complete non-issue.

In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.",Windows 7 is Vista done right,1256169600,43,
10950,4,False,"05 23, 2016",A25QJBK33C4O0R,B0114ZV22E,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},terpfan1980,"I'd probably like it more if they (Microsoft and their developers) made it easier to install the 64-bit version of the software.  Truth be told, it isn't that difficult to do, but some novice users would potentially miss making the choice at all just because it is so darned easy to breeze past it.  Choose custom install and proceed carefully and you'll be fine.

I'm not here to hate on this product, though I've hated on earlier versions in the series -- specifically because Microsoft changed their activation process and have now basically tied all installs to named users, named registered users, named registered users with e-mail addresses provided back to Microsoft to complete the activation process.  That all works fine for one user at a time, but if you made the mistake of buying this product and assuming you could easily install it in a corporate environment for any old user in the place, without having to have it activated on a 1:1 basis, then *beep* *buzzzzzz* *zap* you lose.  If that isn't an issue for you -- and for any single user it shouldn't be a problem -- then this product is fine, assuming you get past the hurdles of whatever has been changed from the version you used to use to the newest version of the product.

If you were previously using Office 2013 (the most immediate predecessor to this), then you probably will find it isn't much difference.  If you were using Office 2010 or older, then you are in for a change.  It isn't insurmountable, but is a bit of a culture shock.

Personally, for home use, I have done the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Office-365-Home-1-Year-5-PC-or-5-Mac-Download/dp/B00B1TEIRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Office 365 Home 1 Year | 5 PC or 5 Mac Download</a>&nbsp;for my household.  The price for that is fairly cheap when you consider it is installed on multiple PCs, for multiple members of my household.  The per user/per PC price is cheap, even with having to buy a new subscription each year.  As an alternative, this product (the one you are reading the review of here) is licensed permanently -- as long as you keep using it on a single PC -- and doesn't need to be renewed each year.  If you've only got a single PC to deal with, it isn't a bad deal, though you can certainly expect that Microsoft will wind up putting out a new version of office approximately once every 3 years.  If you want the newest features then you'd be rebuying the complete package in the future.

The apps in Office 2016 work fine, though as usual with all things Microsoft, you'll find you get plenty of patches, updates, and critical security fixes for Office along the way.  The apps may improve with the patches that are released, but for the most part the underlying software works fairly well.

4 stars from this reviewer.  Always room for improvement along the way, but decent software for what it is intended to be used for.",I'd probably like this a bit more if they made it easier to choose 64-bit install,1463961600,,

In particular, EXCEL is far inferior as Microsoft eliminated any support for macros or Visual Basic in the Mac version.  For a home user with simple needs this is not a serious drawback.  For anyone who exchanges files in a business environment forget about this product.  It is not fully compatible and crashes often.  It will drive you crazy and let you down when you are in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.

WORD also crashes a lot and causes the loss of your work.  A message will come up saying ""WORD has to close unexpectedly,"" and that's it.  All your work is gone.  Back in 1980 we accepted this from computers and saved our work religiously.  This is 2009 and this kind of incompetence is unacceptable.

It is nothing short of dishonesty to claim that Office for the Mac provides the same functionality as Office for the PC.  The latter is light-years ahead in terms of sophistication and stability. Don't believe any salesman who claims the two versions are equivalent.  The Mac version is primitive by comparison.

1) It reduces the amount of memory needed for the OS by about 7 GB. Thus, I have an additional 7-8 GB on my hard drive that I can use for pictures and music. This is important for me since I have thousands of photos from my trips, and while I back them up I also like to keep them on my actual hard drive so I can browse through them quickly. This is important too if you're like me and are still using and older laptop with less than 100GB of memory total.

2) Stacks and expose are a lot more useful and easier to use. You can use expose by holding the mouse on any application in the dock. Stacks allows you to go through multiple folders through the stacks window, not just opening the first folder you click. I hadn't used these features much in Leopard, but probably will now in Snow Leopard.

3) QuickTime X is a major upgrade from the free version of QuickTime installed in Leopard. The new version gives you a pretty decent editing capability for film and audio clips. This came at a perfect time for me as I have some movies from a recent trip but did not yet have a good editing program. Now I do.

4) Faster and smoother. I noticed the OS took faster to load up and applications are much faster. I no longer have to wait 5 minutes for Microsoft Word to open. For details on Snow Leopard's performance, check out some of the other reviews.

Overall, Snow Leopard isn't going to revolutionize your computer, but will make it faster, cleaner, and give you more memory - not bad for $30.","Frees up more memory, runs faster",1252022400,2,

Didn't happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I've tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there (fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out) thinking they've got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply don't exist.

IMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files!

I honestly think they don't want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you don't need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason.

iPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it doesn't. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together (I guess there is a little family resemblance there). The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you're probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually (next 2-3 years) as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you could say iPhoto is ahead of its time.

Garage Band works like it should, but there aren't any improvements that make it worth upgrading. The much flaunted lessons must be bought and downloaded, they don't come with the software. It is useful certainly, but I just don't see anything that makes me believe upgrading is worth it.

Frankly, this is just another ho-hum release. You don't need to upgrade unless you just have to have GPS photo tracking or face recognition software. If you were hoping (like me) that iMovie would be more robust, think again. It would have been very easy for Apple to include two versions of iMovie: advanced and basic. Basic would be the default setting and advanced would include the features lost from the 06 version. It could be turned on or off for the best of both worlds. Instead I have iMovie HD installed on top of iLife 09. Waste of hard drive space.

iLife 09 doesn't offer any compelling reason to update if you have iLife 08. There aren't any improvement that are not relatively minor or obscure (face recognition for example). And there is one MASSIVE disadvatage, at least for those who prefer iMovie 06: installing iMovie 09 will cause iMovie 06 to become inoperable! You have no choice in the matter, and no prompt lets you know that you are losing iMovie HD by installing iLife 09. It just happens.

Why Apple doesn't allow the user to control how many or few features are available is beyond me. I'm not saying everyone should want all the features from iMovie 06, but for those of us that do, why not make them available?

It's convenient.  When we have the file ready to send, regardless of what time it is at the destination end, we can send it.  No more trying to juggle time zones so that we can do a file transfer, no worries about files being diverted or inadvertently accessed by unauthorized computers either.  We send it, and the information on retrieval can be given to the recipient via telephone, fax, email or even text messages.  They retrieve it at a convenient time, and everyone is happy.

It's reliable.  We've not had a single file become corrupted or lost.  With 100% accuracy, we feel secure in the knowledge that the file will arrive intact, giving us peace of mind.

Granted, it's not cheap.  But we haven't found a cheap solution to the large file transfer yet that is nearly this accurate or easy.  Often in the past we would spend hours attempting to successfully transmit a file, only to have it fatally error at the end, resulting in lost effort, time and productivity, and causing the entire process to repeat itself.

Ive used the free version before, which is nice (and the price can't be beat), and now I've got the the paid suite, which offers a competitive set of tools that provide pretty much everything you need.

There were a couple of issues during install however: first, it took quite a while to show as activated, which was really odd behavior.  Then it offered an upgrade to version 9.0, but failed to mention anywhere that it's a FREE upgrade. Free is great of course, not knowing it's free almost made me decline to upgrade.  Finally, it installed a Firefox plugin that I didn't want, and did so without asking.  And it was broken to boot.

Once I got the install issues ironed out though, things improved.  Scans are quick and low on resources, though if you want them run in the middle of the night, it does not default to a setting that wakes your computer up - you must set that in preferences.  I have yet to be infected with anything (that I know of), so that's always a plus.

One irritating issue though is that it will occasionally give me a popup indicating a tracking cookie, but no option to delete it in place, only to go to the file.  In a case like Firefox, that keeps cookies in a database format, that just doesn't help.  If I could set it up to delete specific files when it finds them, that would be great - instead I either have to hit the ignore button every time I start a web browser (that damn persistent atdmt.txt), or add it to an exceptions list - neither suits me, I want it deleted.  Not a deal breaker I suppose though.

In addition to anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-rootkit, AVG IS includes an email scanner, firewall, and anti-spam detection, as well as identity protection.  The email stuff is pretty useless to me, as I don't use a local mail client, but in testing it worked fine.  The firewall is quite good though, and pops up with notifications when it automatically writes a rule, or with a query about allowing a connection. I like software that occasionally lets me know it's working properly.  Which is something I can't say about the identity protection feature, so I'll just leave that out of the review - supposedly it ""compliments signature-based protection of AVG by monitoring how programs behave on your computer,"" but who knows?

Overall, a pretty good product.  At $50 for 2 years, it's a relative bargain, too.  Unless you look at Vipre, for which you can get a family license - but that doesn't include a firewall.

Now you either download with a code provided by Amazon, or you buy the PC card, which come with a card that has the code you use to download from Microsoft.

Microsoft by default installs the 32-bit version of Office.  This is because the 32-bit version place nicer with both versions, while the 62-bit version has some issues doesnt play as nice with other.  So you have to install the 32-bit option first then install the 64-bit version if that is what you want.

You work with extremely large data sets.
You work with extremely large pictures, videos, or animations in PowerPoint.
You work with extremely large Word documents.
Youre working with files over 2GB in Project.
You want to keep the 64-bit version of Office that you're already using.
Youre developing in-house Office solutions.
Your organization requires Hardware Data Execution Prevention (DEP) be enforced for Office applications.

And these suggestions are made because Microsoft warns that the 64-bit version:
Solutions using ActiveX controls library, ComCtl controls won't work. There are many ways for developers to work around this, and provide you with a 64-bit solution.
32-bit third-party ActiveX controls and add-ins won't work. The vendor would need to create 64-bit versions of these controls.
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that contain Declare statements won't work in the 64-bit version of Office without being updated.
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that contain Declare statements won't work in the 64-bit version of Office without being updated.

Fuchs,"I started with Trend Micro when it was still the horribly named PC-cillin and have upgraded it three times (note that I paid for the product the first two times and the last two times received comped review copies).  In between times two and three, my employer required me to install Norton on my computer in order to interface it with the company dial in.  While the Norton was slightly faster than both my version of Trend Micro that came before it and the one that came after, Norton was never as good in my opinion.  Trend Micro found more viruses and spyware and had an easier user interface.  It's one problem was that it was always very slow.

I am happy to report that this version seems to do just as good a job identifying viruses and spyware as previous versions of Trend Micro, but it loads and runs much more quickly.  I also like the feature that Trend has added to the last few versions of this software which is to identify on web search result pages whether or not the sites that come up are safe -- the software shows safe search results in green, questionable sites with a question mark, and unsafe sites with a red ""X"".  We have an older version of Trend Micro at work that doesn't have this feature, so I feel much safer surfing the net at home.

Since this is an upgrade for me rather than a completely new installation, I can't speak to how easy it is to install and configure these days.  It was a little bit hard to configure the software back when I first got the program some six years ago, but once I got it up and running the way I wanted, I've never had to do much of anything to change it and I suspect they've improved the initial set-up as so many other things in the program have improved over the years.

Other people can probably give you a more geek-specific review, but in the six years in which I've been running Trend Micro on my computers in one version or another, I've never had a virus that made it onto my system or that Trend Micro has missed and any other scan has caught (and I periodically run a scan with other software just to be safe).  When I replaced Norton with my third version of Trend Micro, it caught some nasty spyware that Norton had missed.  I will happily exchange a few seconds of connection time for good security and I'm not even sure I'm losing much time anymore.  I am a very satisfied Trend Micro customer.",My fourth version of Trend anti-virus software is the best yet,1257379200,,

Realistically though, the tax laws (in the case of the income tax processing software) change yearly and most lawyers would also advise that the laws surrounding and involving wills, estates, and trusts, also change on a regular basis.  In the end, spending the small amount of money that this useful software costs is a wise investment each year, or every other year if you really want to stretch out the use period for this software.

Besides needing to keep up with changing laws, there's also the idea that spending some time planning out your estate on a more regular basis would be highly advisable.  Ignoring this process could mean you put together a set of instructions that don't get updated and wind up leaving behind an even bigger mess than if you hadn't even bothered to put together a will.  (Do you really want to forget to go back and change your directions if you originally left all of your assets to a wife who long ago divorced you?  Or to kids that haven't called you in years?)

Once installed, the software is easy enough to use.  Installation should be a breeze, though it doesn't always proceed as easily as that.  Just be patient, read the screens carefully, and follow the instructions or use the tips and instructions found online to complete the process.

So when Apple offered to let me play with a review copy of Office for Mac I thought it would be fun to see how it compares to Office on Windows.

The Mac version provides good compatibility and pretty much the same functionality as the Windows version, and manages to do it in a Mac-style that won't have you always feeling like you're running a Windows app.

As a few seconds reading these reviews will tell you, Microsoft was unable to provide Visual Basic for Applications support in this version, so if you're on an older version and have dependencies on this then you probably don't want to upgrade, but for the rest of us who don't write applications  in Office, it's probably not an issue.

So what really is there to say about Office for the Mac?

Well, it's Office. For the Mac.

For a lot of people this probably tells you all you need to know if you're moving over to the Mac for the first time or working in an environment where Office is the de-facto standard for document interchange. If you're used to office on Windows, this will give you the closest experience in terms of functionality you're familiar with, and it does it in a very ""Mac"" way.

If you know you need it, or you know you hate it (or both) then you're probably not reading this review. For everyone else, Office for Mac is a complete office application suite that works well in the Mac environment. Chances are it will offer 10x the features that you'll ever use, just like its Windows counterpart.

I have had several computers and am now using a Dell Dimension 8300 3 GHz , INTEL CPU with 2.5GB memory with XP Pro AND a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop 1.8 GHz with 1 GB memory and AMD64 CPU with XP Home.  I used McAfee starting in 1991 when it free from a bulletin board and then when it was bundled for a fee, then started using Norton Systemworks 2000 - 2005 (which all included anti-virus), Norton Professional anti-virus, Windows Live One Care, Norton Anti-Virus 3 user 2007 , 2008 and recently 2009 when I couldn't use the PC Tools Internet Security program.

I decided to try to install PC Tools Internet Security on my laptop because I keep it pretty clean, transferring files to my desktop computer.  The install disk took a very short time to install - that was nice. BUT...and this is a pretty big ""but"" for me...No matter what I did, my WLAN card was of no use -- Windows kept closing it because there ""was a problem.""  I couldn't register the program because I had no Internet -- because my wireless was not usable.  Because I could not activate the program, I could not use it for updates yet.  I could not access the Internet to find out what the problem so I could not activate the program.  A catch-22 situation.  No Internet meant no program.

I went through all of the settings and told the program to give full access to my WLAN card but it never worked.  No matter what I did I could never get to the Internet.  Made me mad.

A little aside -- when you are asked to activate the program you type in your name, your email address and the multi-alpha numeric product key.  When you click on activate, you are met with -- sorry but there is no Internet and it keeps your email address but you must re-enter your name and product key over and over as you try to register your product.

I never recognized most of the items the lists of choices showed so had no idea if I should allow or block them.  Even with the Zone Alarm Firewall I used to use I knew what most programs were for.  The software didn't seem to block my Explorer browser but did block items like Linksys EasyLink Advisor.  And I guess the program also blocked my WLAN wireless card.

As soon as I uninstalled the program -- which took two tries and two reboots, my wireless access magically came back along with the Internet.  What a relief!  But now I had no Anti-Virus protection.

The software seemed promising -- I thought there was a nice thick manual inside the box -- apparently the manufacturer thought that the heft of the box might lead buyers to think there was something in the box besides a disk.  I couldn't believe it -- a 4 1/4"" X 5 1/2"" X 1/2"" thick notepad with a link to ""special offers for retail customers.""  There was a small flyer with instructions on how to install the program and a few other instructions as well but the manual was on the disc.

Since my Norton Anti-Virus had expired (I will never again wait until my current anti-virus program expires to install a new Anti-Virus program so I can use the old one until I get another new program) I ended up downloading the free version of AVG and going to Costco to buy Norton Anti-Virus/3-user software so I wouldn't be without protection on my two computers.  No waiting until low sale prices with rebates or anything a/c I was desperate.

I see by the other reviews that most were able to use the program after any difficulties.  Maybe they are all IT's or MIT graduates.  Programs shouldn't be this difficult.  I thought the program should be more intuitive and not block everything on your computer so you can't even use it.  People complain about Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus but I like all of the programs I have used except their Internet Security from 2004 -- it just slowed down my computer as well as others in my family including one who had a BS degree in Computer Science and a LOT of work experience with computers.","Only for the VERY informed computer user - not me, I guess",1239408000,,

What I found instead was a  great program for editing and proofreading all kinds of documents, and a bit of software that can convert scanned files or files already on your computer; including photos, documents and others, into files you can easily edit.

Positives or at least not negatives for me...
This software includes a Cloud Connector.  Integrated with Evernote and Dropbox, it also works with other 'clouds' in a drag n' drop way. You can upgrade the service as well for automatic back-up of your files. I thought the addition of the Cloud Connector was a nice touch, but didn't like that you had to upgrade for true integration and service.

When you scan an image and such as a paper with binder holes in it, there's a way to remove those images, which I thought was pretty nice. Scanner enhancement tools make all the scanned images ultimately look great, whether they are text or images.

One feature some may find useful is the automatic language detection.  I didn't like that Russian and Greek were not supported though, as it only allows for Latin-based languages, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.  Seems like they could've figured out how to add the others!

Converting a 460 document to PDF took about 3 minutes, which I thought was pretty fast. The document looked like the original and the proofreader quickly checked it and asked me to change items or ignore.  I liked that I could easily edit the document once converted.

NOTE RE: Kindle integration...
I then tried to send it to my Kindle, which failed and locked up the program on my Windows 7 machine three times.  I never did get the document sent to the Kindle, but will keep trying.

I do like that when I have received email attachments in various forms I can then save the file in any format I choose by converting them with Omnipage 18.  Images from Ipad, IPhone and digital cameras are also easily converted to a readable format for ebook readers.  Something I've yet to try, but hope will work with my Kindle eventually.

Negatives for me...
My computer exceeds the minimum system requirements for this product and yet the performance of it has been choppy - 'not responding' errors throughout my usage of the product.

I have also encountered in the 'Help', 'Getting Started' guide, things that I thought I had as part of this software are actually only offered on the 'Pro' version which costs 4x's as much!  Why list it at all in the 'Help' unless they want you to buy more and upgrade?  I didn't like it as I wasted time reading it only to find I didn't have ""Form Data Extraction"", ""Job Life Cycles"", ""Email Integration"" and ""Barcode Processing"", among others, only to be disappointed I didn't have them.

Omnipage 18 does support a wide range of formats including WordPerfect, MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML and PDF, which is great.  It integrates with your scanner to save files and convert them quickly into easy to manipulate documents. It is a good product when it's not acting fussy, and has promise, but so far it's just 'OK' for this user.

My previous French language experience came from two years of high school classes about sixteen years ago.  I've had a few other language classes since then, establishing me if not as a thorough polyglot at least as a someone well versed in language training from a variety of different teaching styles, approaches, and contexts.

I've tried to keep up with a number of these languages I've studied, with various success, and with various software help. Mostly the inexpensive kind.  I've picked up the Instant Immersion disks (a great, inexpensive, entirely un-thorough approach), the Learn to Speak series (about the same, though with a lot more content).

Recently, to learn German for my studies I looked at more thorough programs and two stood out.  The Rosetta Stone series and the Tell Me More.  I noticed Tell Me More was getting great reviews and was less than half the price.  Being a little financially strapped I skipped the trend and bought Tell Me More. And I'm very glad I did. It's an effective program that has pushed me quite along in learning the language.

Still, there was a tickle in my brain.  Is Rosetta Stone really better?  So, when it came time for me to start with French, also for my studies, I decided to make a contrast.

And yes, Rosetta Stone is the better program.

In some ways.

Really, I'd have to say these are quite different programs, rather than one being substantially better.

Tell Me More is a like a class in a box.  There is a mix of exercises that help to build vocabulary, sentence structure, writing, pronunciation, and other aspects.  Each section has a large mix of short lessons that reinforce the learning without becoming dull or tedious.  Save yourself taking language classes by using Tell Me More.

Rosetta Stone is a lot less like taking a class.  It's more like finding yourself on an island with a group of people who all only speak another shared language.  And if you want to learn how to thrive on this island, then you follow their patient, but focused, teaching.

This approach sticks, and it is effective.

My only quibble is I'm not sure it's quite worth the amount of money they are asking.  Indeed, if money isn't an issue then by all means go with Rosetta Stone.  There are qualities that do set it apart, and it helps a person feel much more involved in the language and less like taking a class.

But, if money is an issue Tell Me More is comparable in quality, without being nearly as expensive.

That's not a slam against the product quality of Rosetta Stone at all. It really is an extraordinary software, and revolutionizes language learning.",Quite amazing,1219881600,321,

Gone are most of the self-aggrandizing promotions and registration issues of recent years; in the place of all the self-promotion, I found the 2005 package to be extremely stable, useful, and generally quite logical.

Installing the program was uneventful and straightforward, as was downloading the state product (in my case Minnesota.) Updating the program was likewise a non-issue. I found the interview this year to be more logical and user-friendly than in years past. I have a fairly intricate return, and I had very few issues navigating the interview. The one place that I did have some confusion (cleared up by ""Your Income Tax 2006"" by J.K. Lasser) was in entering qualified tuition expenses, as the program gives you two separate possibilities to enter them. That is a fairly trivial issue and affects few people, but does point out that there is still room for improvement in the program (especially in the ""help"" features.) I also have a perpetual question (that is really insignificant, but makes me wonder ""What were they thinking?""): why does TurboTax make you enter your phone number, but fails to print it in the correct space on your 1040 (making you print it by hand), yet on the state return it does print it out? These are obviously very minor observations, and in no way detract from my recommendation.

I have tried TaxCut in years past (though I did not do a direct comparison with TaxCut for the 2005 tax year), and while it is cheaper, I still believe that TurboTax is the better value. It is complete (especially the Premier program), fairly intuitive, and produces accurate returns as well as very useful worksheets for your records. TurboTax is fairly expensive, but I believe it's worth it.

TurboTax for the 2005 tax year is a marked improvement over years past, and I recommend it for preparation of all but the most mind-bogglingly complex returns. For those, I recommend a CPA.",A Good Choice For Most Tax Situations,1141948800,4,

Installation was easy, although the first thing KIS 2011 did was check for a more recent version of itself, which I downloaded before I installed anything.  Nice to be up to date.  Upon completing installation, I manually updated the virus definitions.  I'm sure the program would have done it automatically given time, but I wanted to update them right away, so I did it manually.

The program has a very clean and organized interface.  Finding what you need is fast and easy.  A big green button lets you know you are safe and protected.  Alternatively, if something is amiss this button will be yellow or red so you can easily tell the state of your protection.

I was also impressed with how configurable KIS 2011 is.  If you like to tweak settings, then you'll love it.  That being said, it also runs extremely competently ""out of the box"" with everything left at ""default.""  It does not seem to slow my computer at all, which is a huge plus.

Parental controls are extensive and easy to use, and include monitoring of time, blocking webpages and keywords, and allowing internet usage.  Accounts can be password protected, so your kids can't change the settings!  Extra features of KIS 2011 include a virtual keyboard (keyloggers can't detect this type of input) which installs into your browser, and is activated on demand by a tiny icon in the browser's existing toolbar.  I thought this was a nice way to implement this feature; no annoying extra toolbars cramping your browser window!

This version has a license for three computers, but be aware that you have to install and activate all three licenses within 30 days of the first one, otherwise the remaining/unactivated ones will be invalid.

In conclusion: I have tried two other 2011 ""Internet Security"" suites, and uninstalled both.  KIS 2011 is my choice for this year.  I'm very happy with it.","Highly configurable, fast, user friendly",1297728000,,

But the last time I looked those programs were more than 4 times as expensive and targeted to an entirely different audience. For what it is and what it costs, Bento is pretty (expletive deleted) good. It's easy to use, easy to learn and well integrated with Address Book and iCal. With that integration it can quickly be massaged into a capable project management database. For those missing the database in Appleworks it is a definite upgrade.

I wanted a bird watching database that would include photos, recordings of songs, places, sighting dates, descriptions, related species and miscellaneous notes. I'm collecting information, not doing calculations this is a nice fit.

Within 45 minutes of installing the program I had my forms ready and was entering data. Being a designer, I went back and prettied up my forms a bit but that wasn't necessary. I went back and looked at the tutorials later and they seem pretty good.  My first inclination was to build the db in MySQL and put a web front end to it but that would be a lot of work. Bento was just what the doctor ordered. Bento is a little funky in the way it does joins but is a kind of relational database. But then I didn't want to mess with SQL anyway.

I would like to see some Applescript capabilities and a bit more flexibility in printing reports. I haven't tried to integrate Bento with Automator. With no Applescript dictionary, I'm not hopeful. But scripting a database is not something I would expect the target market for this app to even think of, or if they did, they would run screaming in terror.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,2,

CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **
It seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered

Method A (simplest)
If you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install, without entering the product key. After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows. Enter your product key and it should activate. This has worked for me twice.

Method B (hardest)
If Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.
1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the ""Search programs and files"" box.
2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/. In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall. Double-click on it and change the value from ""1"" to ""0"" and click OK.
3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select ""Run as administrator."" You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.
4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter. Reboot.
5. Now try to activate. If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install. If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.

Method C (most time consuming)
Perform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.
** END UPDATE **

I had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date. The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7. This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.

64-BIT
I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.

DESKTOP
At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have ""pinned"" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.

LIBRARIES
Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.

NETWORKING
Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.

SECURITY
Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like Norton's.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.

POWER MANAGEMENT
Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.

WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER
I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.

WINDOWS XP MODE
For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.

RECOMMENDATION
If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.

SUMMARY
Windows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.

What I mean by this is that things Vegas handles with ease PowerDirector cannot handle.  For instance, I pulled in a clip of uncut mp4 that was about 1GB in size, and PowerDirector sputtered and spit like I handed it a 160GB of raw HD footage.  Then when I tried to trim it by dragging an edge PowerDirector crashed and burned.

This is what I do on a regular basis with Vegas and is basically my workflow.  Also there doesn't seem to be an equivalent of a ""Trimmer"" in PowerDirector as far as I can tell.  Granted I'm still trying it out so I may stumble on it.  I like the Trimmer because I can cut large videos into pieces and add them into the timeline piecemeal.  With PowerDirector it seems I need to pull the video onto the timeline then cut.

My impression thus far is that this is a good program for taking short clips off of your phone or digital camera and composing a short piece but for larger projects, you'll need something more solid.

MS Windows 8 and 8.1 tries to be two things in one package, an operating system for both desktop computers and tablet computers. There is a bit of a learning curve for finding all of the functions of the computer. This version also requires that you log in with Microsoft Account. It is used for saving all of your settings and passwords as well as buy and downloading Apps in the Windows Store. Other than having a quicker boot up time and having the Start Screen, MS Windows 8.1 seems to be a lot like MS Windows 7.

As a Mac user and a long time MS Windows user, I still have to look for things when I want to change a setting or something. There seem to be settings in the Control Panel for the Desktop mode and most of classic windows settings. There is also another pane of the Start Screen for settings that have to deal with the Tiles and the Start Screen. It seemed kind of odd, that I had to go into the desktop mode to set up my printer and that there is only current apps that then could access the printer in the Tile mode. Also I think what is odd, is that Internet Explorer in the Tile mode does not carry over all the settings that I have set for Internet Explorer in the desktop mode. I think this is kind of crazy. This is just one of the may interesting aspects of the new version of MS Windows.
MS Windows 8.1 is a vision of having one inter face for both traditional computers as well as new touch computing devices. I would only recommend this for people who are true MS Windows fan boys or someone who thinks they will really like the new Start Screen interface. Otherwise I think it might be kind of confusing for some people. I would say that it was a good try on Microsofts part but it seems a little too awkward unless its being used on a touchscreen.

If things were more organized and easier to find, I could give this a higher rating than three stars. MS Windows 7 seem to make was a good operating system and seemed to be more organized. I would say that this is better than MS Windows Vista. I think this is a good upgrade of you want the new Start Screen interface other wise you are not missing much with MS Windows 7.

As for the Premier program itself, it actually runs fairly smoothly this year with relatively few glitches. It did make an error involving excess employer contributions in an HSA that was extremely complicated to fix, but other than that it was hassle free.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

I've used every version of DOS and windows since 3.1, and I knew that XP was getting old, so I was excited to install Vista. It was the worst mistake I made since instaling Me 7 years ago. It took so long to install that I was able to watch a full length movie. Afterwards it was so slow that it made my brand new computer feel like my my Celeron 550 Mhz computer from 7 years ago. I turned off ""Aero"" because I thought it was just a resource hog. Then I got rid of the gadgets, User Account Control, and other annoying ""features"". Then I figured defragging my hard drive would help. In XP it takes maybe 5 mins on a bad day, but it took 3 hours in Vista. Vista takes forever to boot, and even though Dell gave me a drivers upgrade DVD for Vista one of my components wasn't compatable. So afer a day I decided I wanted to go back to XP. Dell gave me a backup partition, and it should have only taken 6 mins it said. But Vista deletes programs without telling you and certainly without your permission. So I had to reinstall everything by hand. That took days and many calls to Dell. So I guess the ""WOW"" experience for me is: a trashed hard drive, slower performance, and an expensive paperweight for days.",Worst Windows since Me,1175817600,11,

It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.

The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

The software is much clearer to use and the prompts are very helpful. I was upset that Intuit decided to exclude schedules C and D this year and so had purchased H&R Block's software. H&R Block had more difficulty with my minister's housing allowance so I relented and purchased Turbo Tax 2014. It handled my housing allowance just fine as it has all the past years I've used it. I don't use schedules C or D so that feature removal didn't impact me. I definitely prefer and recommend Turbo Tax over H&R Block. I haven't used Taxcut so I can't speak to it.

An Addendum: I've been a minister for some 30 years and have always done my taxes and have never been audited, knock on wood. Because of this I have tried to stay on top of tax filing requirements for ministers. As any minister knows filing taxes as a minister is pretty complex and requires a multitude of forms and actions that many ministers cannot follow, that a non-minister cannot understand, and that many tax professionals have difficulty with, if one is to satisfy IRS requirements which is a moving target. I offered a synopsis of my experience with H&R Block's software versus Turbo Tax. I did not list every detail for brevity and because I'm not going to put all ""my business on the street"".

1) I only efile when I'm getting money back which I will this year. I efile to get money back quickly. If I have to pay the government I would paper file and the extra cost, with the included ""free"" efile, would be a waste of money for me. I would rather have the choice to spend the [...] for efile or not; not have it bundled in the price.
2) I'm curious about the positive comments made by the beta testers.
3) It will save me a little time entering last year's data.

However I haven't been thrilled with TurboTax even though I've used it for several years. It works but Intuit keeps changing the interface each year which drives me nuts. Its the same problem with Quicken, changing the user interface and often making it worse. The 2007 version of TurboTax seemed to be one of the harder versions to use in my opinion. Usually I want to make a quick pass through my taxes to see roughly where I stand. The 2007 version made this quick pass very difficult because it was insistent on making me enter data when I just wanted to skip screens. I'd have to go back about 4 or 5 years to find a version that I thought was best. It will be interesting if the beta testers are right and they improve it this year.

TurboTax is supposed to be able to import data from Quicken. I gave up using that feature several years ago because the linkage between the two programs was a royal pain. If I did the import on one computer then tried to finish my return on a second computer it wouldn't work at all. I was forced to continue using the first computer. Further TurboTax was fussy about how I entered my data in Quicken and to get it right I had to keep going back to Quicken to make changes and reimport. This was way more work than simply entering the data by hand.

Now with the price going up for no benefit to me I will give it one more year. If things don't improve I'll look elsewhere.

I wondered myself back when this game first came out, as almost every game before this one had been a delight. When I finally played the game, it never failed to amaze me.

Nancy's going to Arizona with Bess and George, to visit her friends' Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed at their new ranch in Phoenix. Nancy arrives before Bess and George (whose flights are consistently delayed), only to find that strange things have been happening at Shadow Ranch lately. According to legend, the horse of an outlaw named Dirk Valentine haunts the ranch, cursing those who see it with bad luck. After it appeared the night before Nancy's arrival, a rattlesnake was found in Ed and Bet's room and bit Ed! When it looks like these attacks seem to be choreographed, Nancy starts seeking the truth behind this phantom horse, its history, and the truth about what happened to a legendary treasure that Dirk left for his love who lived on Shadow Ranch years ago...

The story became very gripping, and just who the culprit was going to be at the end was truly a mystery (pun slightly intended). There were quite a number of twists and turns that I never saw coming, but all were very tastefully handled. Overall, I'd say this game has one of the best stories (and I'd hope so - it *is* based on the bestselling Nancy Drew book of all time).

The graphics were definitely the best upon the release of this game, and still continue to rival several of the more recently-released games. The characters are all wonderfully animated, and their gestures and body language is very realistic. The scenery was very detailed, and everything appeared almost as if it would if it were encountered in real life. I also liked how the phantom horse was animated whenever it appeared.

All of the characters were rather likable, in the cases of both the phone friends and the suspects. Eventually, all of the suspects grew on me, to the point that I'd be disappointed no matter who the culprit was. They were so lovable, and remain one of the best casts to appear in a Nancy Drew game yet.

The suspects include Dave Gregory, the foreman of the ranch who seems very shy whenever he's around Nancy. Shorty Thurmond is the cook, who's as opposite to Dave as night is from day with his consistently running mouth and love of gossip. Tex Britten is the head wrangler, and has a very creepy aura and personality about him. Mary Yazzi is the first Native American character to appear in a Nancy Drew game, and she runs her own store on land adjacent to Shadow Ranch. They all fit together nicely, and the amount of interaction they have with Nancy is not only exceptional, but also the interaction they have with each other. Nearly all of them have something to say about each other, and we get to really understand how they get along with each other as well as with Nancy. This was such an awesome idea, as it makes the case much more believable and the characters all the more real and able to be related to.

The puzzles and challenges were pretty enjoyable. Several were challenging, but not impossible. My favorites were the mini games in Mary's shop and in Dry Creek (a ghost town that appears later on) and the cake baking challenge. I didn't really care for maze and flowers puzzles because they were exceptionally difficult, but two out of several isn't all that bad.

I don't typically care for country music, so the soundtrack didn't stand out quite as much to me. However, this is just a personal taste, not a set-in-stone rule. Besides, the game *does* take place on a ranch. The soundtrack for this game should sound Western, right? So, regardless of the fact that I don't typically care for country, I have to say that the soundtrack is still as fitting and awesome as ever.

While ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"" does have a few setbacks, it's a very strong Nancy Drew game. I'd say it still holds up as one of the best, especially in terms of characterization and plot development. It earned its spot in the top 3 games packaged in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites package, alongside ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" and ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"". Even though it's not a top five game for me, it's definitely a top ten that's well worth hopping onto and riding to the player's content.",An Epic Ride into the Shadows...,1309219200,2,

It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software.

While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this or Deluxe. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns.

I've had it for months now because they claim that over time, Dragon will learn your profile and perform better. The real problem is I find the experience working with Dragon to be frustrating. I've tried to dictate stories in Word 2010, write e-mails, reply on message boards, respond on instant messengers and eve toyed around with navigating in Windows. Of those attempts, using Word has been the most successful but still not a great experience. It could be because the bulk of my writing is of the creative kind. I did use a gaming headset that's pretty good and noise reduction.

There are a lot of good points though. For one, I can have the TV going, voice chat on my notebook and still be able to use Dragon with my desktop headset with almost no problems because of the excessive noise. That's pretty cool actually. Dragon did pretty well with some unusual character names in some of my stories, and seemed to learn the other names after several frustrating attempts. Working in Word, there were a lot of better options for corrections, undoing lines and punctuation.

The not so good, I couldn't get Dragon to easily utilize smart quotes. I looked online, and it looks like there are a few creative ways around this problem, but really if my Word doc is set-up to use smart quotes, I just don't understand why it's such a struggle for Dragon to use them. They even updated Dragon with 11.5 that allows you to ""quote"" that, which a really, really nice feature for quoting and dealing with conversations.

Working on a message board wasn't as fun. Dragon seemed to have some trouble with undo, delete and other corrections in comparison to how well those features worked in Word. It was nice on one hand because basic message boards don't really offer an undo, for example, so the fact you can do an undo can be seen as a boon. The problem is, it doesn't seem start and end in appropriate segments like word did. Starting a new paragraph, deleting, doing another sentence and then another and saying undo seemed to wipe out everything.

Really Dragon is a fascinating tool. I know a version of it is going to be used in clinical areas where I work, but I personally found the experience more frustrating than anything else. On the other hand, I am a pretty quick typist, so it wasn't really for speed reasons I would want to use this so much as an easier way to get my thoughts down.

1451,4,False,"07 14, 2007",A26PAN8REXYBYH,B000HCZ9AW,,Brian M. Ranzoni,"I usually assemble my own PCs, but this spring, I decided to gamble on a factory machine. Being a gamer and an artist, I wanted a good performance rig festooned with removable storage ports and cable jacks. So I picked up an HP Media Center and discovered Windows Vista.

Vista Home Premium is to Windows XP as XP was to the Windows 9x series. In other words, I think it's a leap: one of Microsoft's most radical changes in interface, capability, and security that I've experienced. And I've laid my hands on almost every Windows OS since 1992.

Enough so that I find Vista to be superfluous despite its changes. XP users in particular need not apply (an upgrade that is, yuck yuck!).  But for anybody who's looking to finally replace that trusty old copy of 98 Second Edition, or who wants to jump on the multiprocessor, dual video card, high-def graphic experience, then this is the system for you. Just beware--here there be bugs and compatibility issues.

->DOWN TO DETAILS<-

Despite all my talk about big leaps, there is nothing that Vista does that XP users can't do without. Home Premium bundles a number of apps `n' applets that XP must apply separately, but nevertheless is able to apply. Otherwise, the remaining differences are pretty looking, but pretty useless.

>Aeroplane and Horsepower

Such as a new ""glass"" interface called Aero. Everything about it, including the cute sidebar, the marble Start button, and fancy-pants window switching, windows thumbnail, and windows sizing effects--looks better than the ""Fisher Price"" XP. Or any previous version of Windows, for that matter. Vista runs simple effects, such as color-coding file names to indicate a compressed file. And more complex effects: hover the mouse pointer over a program in the taskbar, and a cute little thumbnail screenshot pops up; while hitting the ""switch window"" button in the quick launch box will stack full size pics of your open programs to sort through.

This interface is one of the shallow leaps from XP. It doesn't have much utility but it sure looks like it needs hardware to run. Except Aero ran just fine on my low-range, low powered graphics card installed by the factory: an NVIDIA OEM 7500 LE. And I have confirmed that it will run, if a bit sluggishly, on a single gig of RAM with a modest dual-core processor. Vista also comes preloaded with Direct X 10, which itself is supposed to be a revolution in graphics processing. Since I have no DX10 programs other than Vista, I can't tell you whether this matters or not.

>Stability

What might matter to the performance minded user: stability. I've only used Vista for a couple of months, but I have suffered no OS crashes or freezes. Unlike XP which, while the most stable Windows of its time, still bugged out on me at least once a month. Individual programs still crash or fail to respond--notably AOL and Word 2007. Also, closing a program sometimes triggers a ""Stopped Working"" error message, but I detect no actual harm and I can load such a program right back up. So far Vista has taken every peripheral, drive, and PC card I've thrown at it. On a down note, VHP is so big that a Norton virus scan or disk defrag takes roughly twice as long as it did in XP.

Update 15 AUG 2007: After installing my PSU and graphic card, I noticed system hangs at startup. These seem to be resolved after a recent update. Also, the aforementioned app crashes have been resolved by updates.

Now, in performance, I include the improved power options. Three pre-set states exist: from high-performance/low-savings, to a balanced system, to energy efficiency but low performance. Additionally, the low-power states of previous Windows have been combined in a newish ""Sleep"" mode. According to my documentation, putting the computer into Sleep mode is actually preferable to shutting down the system every night, presumably because Vista runs a number of maintenance programs when I am not looking. These power settings integrate with my monitor's own energy program, incidentally.

>Security

Speaking of management, Vista includes User Account Controls, which basically asks your permission every...single...time...you attempt to install a program, uninstall a program, or run any sort of program which significantly affects the performance of Windows. As an XP veteran myself, I just turn this annoying feature off, since there is currently no scalability to this control (that is, I can't order it what to watch and what to ignore). Vista also has a detailed file sharing security system, to the extent that even an Administrator account can be denied permission to move that Metallica MP3 from your Download folder to your KigAzz Musik folder. No, really, it is that buggy and intrusive.

>Bells n Whistles

Vista also comes preloaded with its own firewall, calendars, news tickers, and system monitors that XP users can separately plug in. Annoyingly, Vista itself has no CPU temperature widget--I have to go into my BIOS for that.

What I think is more useful are all the inherent, if generic, multimedia applications. Vista Home Premium supports HD DVD and HDTV. And users can access their media, including music and video files as well as television, through a Windows Media Center interface. VHP includes generic video capture capability, generic movie editing, generic DVD home movie burning, generic picture gallery, and of course, those old stalwarts, Paint and Sound Recorder (Note that the capabilities of Sound Recorder have been greatly reduced, to the point that in premium it can only record in .wma format and with no onboard editing or sound effect capability). The interface itself is reorganized to include more recognition for gamers. All of your games can be found in a dedicated tab within the Start menu.

Speaking of gamers, Vista is supposed to support games in other ways as well. There's the new Games for Windows protocol, which I really don't know much about, in addition to the graphics support. DX10, incidentally, includes a number of back-compatible Direct3D APIs to support XP-era programs. Games like *Oblivion* run like a dream, while the infamous audio stutter bug of *Half-Life 2* is actually worse than on my XP rig.

Keep in mind also that many new hardware devices still support XP. My new NIVIDA 8600 GTS, for example, includes DX9.0c and supports such systems, even though it is a DX10 card.

->SEND OUT THE BUGS<-

Unfortunately, none of this seems to be enough for *Max Payne* and *Max Payne 2*, which I have been unable to get going on VHP. And that leads me to the compatibility issues. The Windows Upgrade Advisor utility isn't entirely accurate about what software will run well in Vista. I had to replace all of my Norton Software, and I was disgusted to discover that the 2007 edition of SystemWorks still wasn't Vista compatible! And yet, my ancient copy of Adobe Photoshop LE 5.0 functions well enough. My old Canon Zoombrowser has some graphic issues with the buttons, but the pictures themselves appear just fine.

Not so fine are some media limitations. Home Premium includes Windows Media Player 11. This program will write album tags to newly ripped .WAV files. However, old .WAV files cannot be tagged, and will be permanently lumped together under the ""Unknown Album"" section. Because officially, WMP 11 does not support metadata for WAV, just .wma and MP3. Even though it can write in .WAV format. That's just stupid.

Plus, I hate the fact that burning a CD in WMP continues to automatically insert a pause between tracks. Apparently, Bill Gates has never heard a music album that segues, such as almost everything ever published by Frank Zappa and Trent Reznor.

VHP also has some bug issues. As confirmed on the Microsoft support site, wakening the computer from a low-power state causes digital audio drivers to malfunction. In my case, it fills my speakers with static. Three Windows Updates, including the newest one posted on 10 July 2007, have not solved this problem. I found two solutions on my own:

*I can reboot, which is annoying whenever I need to get back on the computer after an absence, such as sleeping, eating, and otherwise living my life.

*Or I can stop using digital audio altogether. Specifically by running analog cables from the speaker outputs of my computer to the multichannel inputs of my receiver, and then telling my computer's sound manager to run speaker audio as the default device. Since *Half-Life 2* only supports analog surround sound anyways, this is no real loss. Except I think it is stupid that a game will happily use stereo cables to support my 5.1 setup, but refuses to use my digital cable for anything except stereo!

->THE BOTTOM LINE<-

Vista is ideal for some and excessive for others.

XP with SP2 is still a current and capable OS, with a third service pack on the way. Microsoft will continue mainstream support until about 2009. So after spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on XP compatible software, you might as well get your money's worth and keep using it. Especially since Vista's successor is already in the works, XP users can safely wait a couple more years.

This is true even for security-minded users. The new account restrictions are appropriate for an actual network that can be accessed by multiple people. You will still need a third party anti-virus and spyware program. For everybody else, XP with Service Pack 2 and regular updates will protect your Jenna Jameson pics and household budgets just fine.

Likewise, those who are serious about media will not need Vista's limited programs. You `ll be looking for more capable products from third party vendors, such as Nero, Paint Shop Pro, or Final Cut. Bleeding-edge gamers and graphic artists will likely appreciate the increased graphics capability, especially since a handful of DX10 games are due this fall, but like physics cards, I wouldn't consider this a must-have tech until 2008.

However, those who are buying their first computer, or who need to replace a much older OS, will benefit from the change in just about every respect: from stability to out-of-the-box capability. You will lose support for some old programs, especially those written before 2002, but those probably need to be replaced anyways. Vista also requires considerably more memory and hard drive space, so those running an older OS are probably in a position to require a hardware upgrade as well.

Finally, Vista Home Premium is ideal for those who want to get their 21st Century Geek on, especially when coupled with a multimedia, high-framerate, high-def death rig. Rrrr! I'm a truck! (Sorry, I just had to throw in a Wildman Fisher reference).

I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites. I am comfortable giving AVG IS a 5/5 stars rating - it isn't absolutely perfect, but what is there is excellent.",Solid Product,1259798400,7,

Fortunately I had backed up the Intuit QuickBooks data files when the PC first started having issues, unfortunately we had long since misplaced the old install disc and codes, so was happy when the Vine Program offered this version. Here are my observations from an upgrade perspective:

Pros -
+ Powerful; the program does provide all of the accounting, payroll, budgeting, and, most importantly for us, invoicing tools we need
+ Easy Upgrade; program walked through the upgrade process as part of the install, came up with all of our recovered data, customer info, and old invoices intact

Misc -
* Interface; the new interface is fairly easy to navigate and is more or less logically laid-out, but really different from the older versions and is not possible to change

Cons -
- Installation; took almost two hours to fully install and register the program
- Color Scheme; was wondering why there were so many complaints from other reviewers, but they really are quite hard to use on my wife's laptop

As noted above, this package will do everything needed from an accounting perspective that we could ask for but it is taking some time to get used to the new look and feel.

I am always impressed with Apple and when I heard that they had cisco vpn built in along with Microsoft exchange support it was a no brainer for me. I am a Systems Admin and lug my windows laptop to and from work daily because I needed the ability to vpn into the office to support servers after hours. With Snow leopards built in support I can now leave the windows beast at work and use my mac while at home. I did find out that Remote Desktop really isn't supported in the non server level Snow Leopard, at least not that I could find and to get the Mac version would cost a lot. Microsoft however does have a free download for Mac called Remote Desktop for Mac version 2.1 and it works beautifully with the Cisco VPN and Exchange to really bring my ability to provide support to where I always wanted it to be on my mac!

Like I said I don't get full access to all the bells and whistles, but for the reasons I mentioned above it was an easy choice to upgrade. Plus the savings in disk space, speed to start up and shut down and all the other visual enhancements really makes this a winner.

If anyone is aware of an Apple version of RDP that is FREE let me know, I hate to use Microsoft products on my mac but for now that was the only free solution I could find without running a VM and I wasn't about to fork out the big bucks for the Apple version that includes that.

Way to go apple, another solid product and another terrific enhancement. It's nice to see a computer company put out software to make their older hardware run FASTER and not put something out like microsoft does where you need to upgrade to make it work. Redmond better get with it, and the price for Snow Leopard is so affordable.

I will say I did purchase my copy through the Apple store directly and had it shipped to my house on the day it was released. I was sad to see that Amazon was going to take a few days to get it to me but I understand that essentially it was Apple that caused that delay.

As such, I have been a fan of Streets and Trips since the 2002 version. Unfortunately, Streets and Trips is merely a slight improvement over its predecessor, Streets and Trips 2006, and still has most of the key problems.

There is no question there are several benefits to Streets and Trips over online ""free"" applications with their invasive advertising, sluggishness and reliance on an Internet connection. Resident map data addresses all of these annoyances and gives the user more control. Putting that particular debate aside, Streets and Trips 2007 does suffer from a lack of connectivity in its inability to update core grid data and point-of-interest data over the Internet.

As I mentioned in my review of S&T 2006, Google Earth is setting the stage in the consumer map world. While Satellite photos do little for trip planning, Google does a nice job of locally caching large amounts of data from a remote server. The Streets and Trips development team must do the inverse of this. Most of the data should be resident on the local computer with dynamic integration from a variety of remote sources.

Dynamic updates can serve many purposes. The most straightforward is correcting inaccurate road information and updating core data as new roads are constructed. Secondly, there is a great deal of POI (point of interest) data that could be updated continuously. Lastly, if Microsoft promoted a comprehensive ecosystem, various government and private entities could provide plug-ins for Streets and Trips. At the current time, this ecosystem does not exist.

The lack of real-time connectivity leads to other shortcomings. In essence, Streets and Trips creates static maps. This precludes the implementation of real-time traffic or weather. Sadly, Microsoft has lost out on so many other value-added features that are provided by Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and the Weather Channel online.

Oddly, key problems in its management of basic street data persist. For example, it can't properly interpret hyphenated street addresses in the boroughs of New York. Of course, it is impossible for a single user to error check the entire database, so I am curious what other errors exist.

Like most map programs, Streets and Trips is automobile-centric. This means that it interprets one-way streets literally. While great for drivers, it doesn't help for walking. Moreover, there is no interpretation of public transit systems where users would walk to a subway or train stop, board, and walk to a destination.

Shortcomings aside, Streets and Trips 2007 is still a very useful consumer mapping tool. After you become accustom to the application, you will find yourself using it for the most mundane trips. It is very fast and easy to use - perfect last-minute errand planning. In the larger context, however, Microsoft does need to update its Streets and Trips business model to provide users with the same features they have grown accustom to with web-based applications. Only then with Microsoft have a killer app.

I decided to order this product to see how it compares. I find it to have a lot of features that many people will probably not need, to be simple to use, and to be valuable for those who want a bit more compression capabilities. For normal users I don't think it adds a lot of needed functionality.

The program installs  in either 32 or 64 bit versions (I tested the 64-bit version). Installation was no problem. The programs uses a ""ribbon"" style interface, like the newer Microsoft Office products; I found it to be very intuitive. It also integrates directly with the Windows Explorer (the file window used in Win 7 and 8), so that one can right click and access options for compressing/decompressing files. The program works by simple drag and drop to add files. Clicking on a zip file brings up the main program. I found the interface and program functionality to be fine.

For an additional 9.95 (each), one can add zip capabilities to SharePoint, Outlook, and Photos. I didn't try those features.

The only real problem I had is that I would have liked to use a command-line interface for backing up files. The program is advertised as having this; according to the documentation, the capability is available as an add-on, but there is no such add-on listed at the web page.

Summary: If you want to create smaller backups, encrypted or self-extracting zip files, or have a need to regularly zip files for professional use, this is a great choice. Highly recommended.

Here are the program features that are NOT built in to Windows:

+ Capability of making self-extracting zip files. This means the person receiving the file can simply click on it to have it unzip itself. I think this is somewhat limited in utility, because most people receiving the file will be able to unzip it anyway via Windows.

+ Advanced levels of encryption. When turned on, the zip file will be protected by AES level encryption. Provided you use a strong password, it is much more secure.

+ Multiple capabilties of zip compression, varying from fast to maximum.

+ Simple integration with cloud drives. You can save directly to those drives and open from them.

+ Direct integration with social media, which allows one to upload directly - although most social media doesn't really use zipped files.

+ Integrated email capabilities (though most folks will use whatever email client they normally use).

+ Capability of resizing photos as they are zipped. This might be nice for those who are uploading to social media or other situations when a specific resize is needed.

+ Capability to convert all files to PDF as they are added to the zip archive. This is useful for professionals who always want to protect their distributed files from being (easily) modified.

+ Capability of adding a watermark to files as they are zipped. This would be very useful for professionals who are sharing samples of their work.

+ Capability of using the program to perform backups. There is a backup menu devoted to this function. This is useful for those with smaller external backup disks. Along these lines, the program allows for a ""split"" archive, and includes settings for the maximum DVD size - useful for making backups to DVD.

Use your imagination to figure out what I was really saying during that dictation!

The first thing I thought was important to note in this review was that there are a couple full Asia's comments that were used in the advertising for this product on Amazon.com.  First, the advertisement states that, ""no script reading required to get started"", and ""require no training,"" which are both statements that are utterly untrue.  As soon as installation is completed, you are asked to begin training for the new user -- just as in previous versions. I'm as shocked as such blatantly false statements could be made in the product's manufacturer or not get in trouble for making them.  When you began in and immediately insisted she go to the standard training, in fact I think it's the same training required in Virgin eight with the same selections.  In fact, I tried starting dictation without doing any training, and I was informed that the user files were not ready to allow this user to begin dictation yet; instead, I was required to get into the same training as was required in Virgin eight before I could do any dictation.  Thus, the reason for my giving this product such a low rating out of the box is because of the false advertising, backspace; if it gets better I mean in my original rating to reflect improvements in the product if they happen during further use in training.  ""Mean in my"" in that last sentence was actually ""I may emend"" (had to type those three words by hand).

As to whether this program's (that word originally came out as ""Koran's""!) dictation is 99% correct as adverse ties in the description, you can be the judge from this dictation's accuracy or inaccuracy.

Oh yes, I also had the same problem of us have had with insistence of either register and reregister and reregister the product.

It is very possible, and that it will improve with use.  However, I'm very frustrated that I opted to delete my previous user files from Virgin eight because I was told by the advertisement of a product that there was no dictation necessary which suggested that I did not need mild user files.  The word ""mild"" in the previous sentence actually was ""my old.""  So much for 99% accuracy.  So far, I can't really tell any difference in original accuracy over Virgin eight, other than the fact that the Dragon bar is graphics look a little different.  The tutorials are the saying with the exception of a small addition of conveying its(that was Advanced) tutorials covering a small amount of information.  The training looks the same date, the N. accuracy at star looks about the same, as Virgin eight.  I hope this will improve with training, but I have to say that I'm definitely not throw for false advertising regarding a lack of training needed to begin using this product.

Other than the addition of an extra installation disk or a DVD, I'm really beginning to wonder if there is any difference for improvement with Virgin nine over Virgin eight, other than the fact that I just blew another [...], after the rebate a having gotten yet, to ""upgrade.""  And, by the way, I truly do not speak ungrammatical he, which I'm guessing is the impression you getting from the gobbledygook you reading here.  Point being, what comes out of my mouth does not as necessarily equal what comes out on the page.  Again judge for yourself the insistence that there is no training needed you can start right away and then it is 99% accurate.  That is In Oh TE what I just said, and so much for the autopunctuation functions accuracy.  Good grief!  Even one I try to correct a nonsensical vacation, what comes out of my correction is anime remotely what appears on the screen to be oh so incredibly accurate Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9.  Oh yes brother, that's got to be in 99th percentile for sure exhalation mark.

Addendum (this is typed, not dictated) --
Another reviewer here, Chris B, is also absolutely right about the ""uninvited guest"" InstallShield Update Manager that surreptitiously gets installed with DNS9 Preferred. I didn't see it until after posting my initial review. This ""Service"" even becomes a permanent fixture in your CONTROL PANEL, and it apparently now ""manages"" my updates for Jasc and Corel products on my computer in addition to DNS9 Preferred. After finding that it does not work to fix the update error problem (see below), I've simply firewall-blocked its recurrent attempts to access the Internet for unknown/undisclosed reasons. Really annoying, and Chris B is also correct in that I also can not find ANYTHING about this unannounced, background add-on program in the Nuance DNS9 documentation.

Interestingly, in their ""knowledge base,"" there is the following disclaimer:  ""The InstallShield Update Manager is not included with any ScanSoft product, but is downloaded from the InstallShield website. To un-install the Update Manager utility, download the remover from Installshield's website.""  In other words, it doesn't come on the discs, but during installation, they download a third party's program off of the Internet and install it on your computer without your knowledge or permission.  Sound comforting?

Additionally, my installation of DNS9 can't recognize the fact that the program has been registered (successfully according to the online web page, but unsuccessfully according to the DNS9 on my computer!) THREE times now, so it refuses to check for updates, giving me the ""Error 13003: Version Not Registered with the Update Service"" message that another reviewer here has also posted about. So, the program won't check for updates. How can I fix that?

The grandiosely named ""InstallShield Update Manager"" does not function to fix this problem (even when I allow my firewall to let it connect to the Internet), so I dunno, but I can get one ""free"" help call with Nuance, but any further ones cost $19.99 per ""incident.""  Even worse, to email for support, you have to complete a ""Problem Report Form,"" which costs $9.95 per ""incident."" I've rarely seen a company charge for email tech support. So, to get this program installed properly, I'm supposed to pay THEM to help me debug THEIR product? Really revolting. Again, to borrow from Chris B's review, he's absolutely right about the lack of ""good ol' customer service with this mob.""

The dictation quality is improving slowly, though it's still nowhere near 99% accurate as advertised, and these other headaches, backdoor sneakery, and the CS money racket just to get the product functional make me want to deduct a star from my original review.  I won't do that, though, in hopes that this revision isn't ""inadvertently withheld in processing"" for a week by this site's management as the first version of my review for this product was.

You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder. I used to prefer Google Desktop search on PCs to Finder, but this upgrade has swayed me to prefer Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!",A bargain for the price and an OS for the future,1251417600,253,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UZLAFQPSL._SY88.jpg']

Also, I have a PhD in Mgmt Science and Information Systems and was a long-time Quicken user, so I'm not exactly stupid, I don't think, when it comes to personal finance software. Here are just a few of the problems I'm seeing:

Default settings, almost without exception, are the worst possible settings.

Advanced budget reports don't work at all. Actual amounts for transfers out appear as positive, but budgeted amounts appear as negative numbers, so the difference is huge precisely when you're saving a lot of money. In some other cases, the budgeted amount in a report has no relationship to what was entered, and there's no visible way to correct it.

Cash flow charts assume all monthly budgeted amounts are subtracted on the first of the month. That makes projected balances very pessimistic - nearly useless.

After downloading transactions online, the program does a lousy job of matching payee names with previous transactions. It's bad enough to make ANY reliance on automated balancing impossible.

If you have a 2002 or earlier copy of Quicken, you may as well keep using it, even though online banking no longer works.

My favorite part of this game is it's ending. It's hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen.

I installed it on computers with both Microsoft XP and Vista Home Premium operating systems.  I previously had Norton Internet Security installed on both, so I thought it was just an upgrade.  For this reason I gave the program 4 stars.  Now I'm not sure.

After two months the XP operating system ran without any problems either on Visa or XP.  But then the new computer running on Vista crashed.  I lost all my files and had to access the recovery portion of the hard drive to get the computer to boot.  Then I had to download all the security downloads.  I have only dial-up so this has taken many hours.  And I have to reinstall all the programs I use - and delete the junk programs that came with the HP computer.  What a mess, and what a lot of work. Even the backup disk, created with Norton 360 didn't work as I hoped.  I do have all the files on the disk, but they did not all reload after I fixed the crash.

Update 3/1/09:  Maybe the problem was with the operating system, Vista Home Premium; or maybe it was Norton 360.  And maybe the glitch was repaired with a later update I download.  Anyway, the problem hasn't manifested itself since I reinstalled everything. Furthermore, I must admit, the problem never did occur with the WinXP operating system.  Also, it should be noted that the program I'm using has been updated with a new version.

Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.

Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.

The process of learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.

My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Mexico. P-)",Better than Spanish 101,1218672000,26,

The most important stuff that Norton 360 does is rarely noticeable. Every once in awhile, while surfing, I will get a heads up about a website known for malicious activity or told that a file I tried to download is corrupt. N360 runs regular scans to check for viruses and infections or to let me know when it is time to take some additional action to tune up for performance. My favorite and most used feature is the Identity Safe, which does exactly what Norton says: ""remembers, secures, and automatically enters your usernames and passwords for you, so they can't be lost or stolen.""

One trick that I learned (that at least one other person here has shared) is do not set up your account to automatically renew.

I will be testing and reviewing this on an Intel Core i7-4770, 16GB ram in Windows 10 64bit.  Additional hardware to note is gpu of Nvidia gtx970 and a 4k lcd monitor.  Files to be tested will be 4k and 1080p.

I normally install most of my programs to D, not the typical C, so here's hoping there won't be any issues with that.  Required space for service pack is 460Mb.  And there is a problem, the updates you can choose a path to download, but the main program just decides it wants C.  Main program is 7.30Gb.  Installation was wonky in a sense for me.  The update seems to download first, then you wait a while while you think it installs (to C:) then after everything is done, you are given the option to pick where you want to install it and it installs again?  In the end, the main program installed itself to C, gave me an install choice in which I chose D but it installed Pinnacle MyDVD there...so who knows what it needs to install.  After installation, you'll be greeted with a registration page upon startup of the program.  After startup, make sure to set your preferences.

I imported a very wind shaken video clip and wanted to see how easily or how well Pinnacle could smooth it out.  I couldn't figure out how to add my own track and opted to use one included in the program.  I decided to export a 2560x1440 video to 4k to see how it goes.  I was using a stabilizer filter or effect, not sure what it's called.  But the filter displays as ""NewBlue Stabilizer: Analysis required"", we'll see if it goes away after rendering/exporting.  Well, the stamping remained and there was no audio (I forgot to unmute the soundtrack track).  I don't know.  Then the effects tab went away after I restarted Pinnacle, hoping that would clear things up.  Maybe the effects were located in some directory I changed.  I don't know.  Anyway, I tried again to see.  Second time worked with the audio track and no stamped filter thing, because I couldn't use it.  Surprisingly the 4k file is smaller than the original and still seems to retain the quality.

Features I'll hopefully test out will be the live screen capture and later the stop motion animation.  Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate also features 360 video editing, something I want but not sure if I can make use of given what I have.

Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.

Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.

Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time.

You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.

If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos.

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.

The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.

Over the years the Internet has evolved and technology has changed, but I've stuck with a simple text editor for most of my needs.  I tried Microsoft Frontpage back in the day, but felt it was just so bloated and inefficient that it wasn't worth it.  It was with hesitation and a lot of reservations that I finally decided to give Microsoft Expression Web a shot -- and wow, Microsoft has come a long, long way.

First thing about Expression Web is that it's so flexible depending on your skillset.  Are you still working with Frontpage extensions?  No problem!  Are you moving up to using stylesheets?  It will guide you and help you along!  Maybe you run your own site with custom coding -- Expression understands PHP, Javscript and ASP without a problem!  It will even do syntax checking as you write the code.

Even if you are a web guru Expression Web can help you out.  With extensive support for XML, CSS and data sources you will find everything you need to keep your site chugging.

Gone is the inefficient, slow and incompatible features of Frontpage and in is the support for WWW, XML and CSS standards.  You'll love how it can help you not only keep your site compliant with the latest standards, but also how it helps with promoting your site from ""dev"" to ""prod"" with just a few clicks.

I tried Dreamweaver in the past, and found it not only too complicated, but way too expensive.  Expression Web is really going to give Dreamweaver a run for their money -- and their user base.

That said, unless you're doing something that absolutely requires MS Office support, it's hardly worth it (except *maybe* for the fonts, and those only if you know how to dig them out of the .app bundles). At least OOXML is a more-or-less open file format, so importing and exporting is easy, and at least you can still buy a non-subscription version of Office.

For the rare occasion I need office programs, I use a mix of iWork and LibreOffice, both of which are no-charge. To switch to MS Office, there'd have to be a very compelling reason to do so, and I just don't see it. The ribbon *might* be a better approach to the toolbar hell of LibreOffice, but I still don't really like it on the desktop (it works fine on the iOS version of Word though). And I really, really don't like that it expects me to use my Microsoft account to use it; it's nice to have cloud access and such there, but seriously, if I want to work offline, there's no reason that should be a problem. And, like I said, the fonts that it comes with are generally pretty nice (Franklin Gothic, for example, or the ClearType series), but if you don't know the internal structure of an .app bundle, you'll never find them or be able to use them outside Office.

Basically, it's really hard to recommend going out and buying this when the alternatives cost you nothing but download time and everything reads and writes Office file formats anyway.

I'm a recent Mac convert and was devastated if not completely amazed that no company has really created a blow your socks off financial suite for the OS.

Nothing, and I mean nothing connected to my banks (which have direct download) as smooth as the Quicken for Windows did.  The last straw was one of the programs actually reported your available balance on a credit card in it's summary as your balance owing.  The solution was to make a manual entry initially to ""force"" it to report correctly.  Not gonna happen.

So, out of sheer desperation and being willing to toss away $19 on this download I went for it.  I have to say, what is wrong with you people?

This worked FLAWLESSLY the first time for me.  Every bank was found and every account was downloaded perfectly that I wanted it to.  As a matter of fact, it also grabbed one of my banks that has a loan and it grabbed my insurance bill!  Even the Windows version wouldn't do that.  But as I type this in, I'm staring at my updated and downloaded loan balance.  FANTASTIC!

The product overall is good and reasonably priced. Just remember to never renew this (or any other security software) from the company that makes it. Always go to amazon.

Why no disk? They give several reasons that include saving the environment but the best reason is that if they need to upgrade the software you will automatically get the most up-to-date version when you download.

Installation: If they aren't going to give a disk then they should make it easier to get the right software. But you go to a website and then it's click here and then pick an OS and then pick a software and then choose the download manager and the whole thing was confusing. I can guarantee that my wife would not have been able to figure out what links to click on. When it finally downloaded everything the download manager ended up behind the web browser page so I didn't realize that it was completed. Once the installation started it did remove the old security software very easily with no more intervention than telling the old software that it was OK when prompted. When it restarted the PC the installation software started right up again without any prompting from me.  There was a long pause between the completion of the installation and the activation screen so that left me wondering if it was done or not.

Quick Scan: The Quick Scan took about 15 minutes to run. It is easy to trigger as there is a big button labeled quick scan right in the middle of the console and you can set it to automatically shut down when the scan is complete.

WinDVD is probably the most useful of the quartet, offering basic DVD playback with some more advanced features for custom playback. The photo and video programs (PaintShop and VideoStudio) are Express versions, in other words, very basic stripped down versions. They do only a handful of basic things each, and because of that, they are relatively simple to use. VideoStudio offers basic adjustments (white balance, brightness, noise, shake), and you can trim or split the video, rotate the video, or take a screenshot. Snapshots go to the bottom of the page. DVD Factory is more featured like WinDVD, however, it has some flaws. For example, if you are making a disc with mp3s (Audio File), you can't just drop a folder/directory into it, you have to add the mp3 files on their own. A workaround is to create a Backup Disc instead of an Audio Disc, and then you can add folders.

This program follows the media library philosophy. Every file you want to work on or put on disc, you have to import into the program, using the Import function at the top of the window. Whether this is good or not, it depends on how you prefer to use it, how many files you have, and how you like to work. It can be useful if you are setting up a computer for someone who is not very computer-savvy.

Overall, the program has performance issues. On a dual-core Vista computer it is rather painful, but on a basic quad-core Windows 7 computer it does better. The issues appear to be with the folder navigation and menus, I haven't had a crash during actual operations (eg burning a disc). But when you are wandering around in the menus or browsing folders, it's not unusual to get Windows 7 errors. Not cool in 2011, especially since this is intended to be beginner's software.

The programs start in full screen mode, which can be irritating if you are a multi-tasker.

Installation
============
The installation was smooth on both Vista and Windows 7 but it takes a few minutes before it finishes. During the installation it has a handy slide-show that introduces various program features. The earlier Vista install grabbed the image file extensions, but the Windows 7 install did not.

After the initial installation from the disc, it searches for updates online (in the background) and brings up a message asking you if you want to continue. The update installation takes a few minutes as well. No reboot! The Extras on the installation disc are just iTunes, Quicktime, and Flash which you probably have already on your computer and your computer probably has newer versions. There is very little to none flexibility in setup and configuration of the program.

When launched for the first time, the program looks at predetermined places on your computer for videos, audio and images to import - without asking you first, and without offering a clean way to stop it. You can always kill the process with the Windows Task Manager (kill it once, it restarts, then kill it again). If you happen to have lots of stuff in the folders it is looking, or you are in middle of doing something else, you don't want this to hog your computer importing files. Then again, this is intended for beginners, so I guess it's a ""feature"".

Along with the four programs, there is a Windows gadget for quick launch of the four programs. This can be useful if you plan to use these often.",Basic multimedia software suite (mixed bag),1307232000,,

We know on the PC's it's a must if you are on the internet. On a mac it is still debatable and on the smart phone it depends on the OS you run and what you do. The safe practice is to make sure you have some protection just in case. Consider McAfee LiveSafe 2015 your seatbelt. You get it not because you think you are going to get a virus but because you don't know and want to be safe in case something does happen.

What you get when you buy the LiveSafe 2015 package at least in my case is a 5.5"" x 8.5"" cardboard envelope, inside is a product key that you use when you go to McAfees website. This allows you to download the software and install it directly. I think this is a brilliant idea. First it reduces the cost of manufacturing and ultimately in theory should reduce the cost of the product, but it also allows you to install the software on a system that does not have a cd-drive. In addition to installing on a windows or MAC PC, this can be installed on an Android smartphone as well.

You are getting a suite of tools, first off virus and malware protection along with phising/spam blocks. You get access to McAfee SafeKey which remembers your passwords. If you use LastPass this is not needed, but it is nice they throw this in as an extra. You get 1gb of cloud storage that uses voice and face authentication. And you get free technical support for the life of the product.

The virus protection itself performs very good, it doesn't seem to slow down my PC much at all, and in the android world it works as you would expect. It really is good insurance, the virus protection part.

I will say that the two extras they include I'm not that thrilled about. Password and document management is nice, but like I said I use LastPass and already have the functionality for $12 a year for password management that works across all my devices. But then I also have a google account, and if you are using this on android you do too. With Google you get Drive which allows you to have a lot more than 1 gb of storage for free. The benefit of McAfee is it does do voice and face authentication, but personally I use two factor authentication through google so I feel safe.

Don't buy this for the password management and document storage, buy it for the anti-virus protection. It's nice that this allows you to install it on all of your devices, you are not limited to one or two. In fact it doesn't say what the limit it, just ""subject to limitation on reasonable use and purpose of the product."" whatever that means.

This is a fully functional Office package that rivals and in some cases surpasses MS Office. Each of the programs load more quickly then it's MS Office counterparts do on the same PC.  It installs in less time then MS Office and you are asked less questions during the install.

It can open almost any file including PDF's but with the documents originally created in MS Office it makes slight format changes and in some cases changes the font style.

When I tell it to SCAN, it asks me to setup the backup program.  Which leads me to another complaint...

Norton 360 includes TONS of ""features,"" and you don't get any option to choose what is installed.  You MUST install EVERYTHING, even though a lot of them are just low-quality versions of things you can get for free otherwise without being locked into a proprietary subscription.

Many of the ""features"" of Norton 360 are just reminders to use some of Windows included abilities.  Delete temporary files?  Defrag hard drive?  Thanks, I'd rather have bought the cheaper version.

I installed it, and Norton gleefully displays a green check to indicate that I am ""protected"" against viruses, even though it had not yet run an update.  WINDOWS had to tell me that my virus program did not have a recent update, and I had to manually tell Norton to update.  Apparently Norton thinks ""protected"" means that your virus program will be working TOMORROW, even though TODAY my virus database is over a year old.

COOKIES are listed as ""unrepairable virus"" in the scan results. Can we say ""overkill?""

The backup utility cannot be disabled.  You can try, but it won't stop.  And it only includes 2 GB of backup space!  You have to ""buy"" more backup space, and 2GB is not enough for anyone's stuff.  For giggles, I checked the price of buying more storage from Norton.  It is literally 10 TIMES the cost of buying a hard drive.

Even more:
Norton pops up a little window telling me I have a ""threat"" which is being ""processed"", and yet it won't tell me what kind of ""threat"" it is.  Apparently it could be anything from a tracking cookie to a virus/worm.  It doesn't show up in any of the history or logs.

Right now all of our household computers are hooked into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-Home-Server-OEM/dp/B000VWW8QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows Home Server OEM</a>&nbsp;so our anti-virus and backups are centrally managed.  However, when he leaves for college that won't be an option for him.  I wanted something that was easy to use and didn't bog his laptop down.  Unfortunately, although OneCare is a good product, it just didn't fit the bill.

First off, let me say the product has a lot of nice features -- including automated backups, firewall, anti-virus and more rolled into one thing.  However, as I've learned in the past, sometimes rolling too many features into a product can give you a less than stellar offering.  It's hard to be the ""best"" in every category -- and I think this is where OneCare suffers.

I found the Firewall to be terribly annoying.  I prefer to leave software-based firewalls turned OFF because hardware-based firewalls are much more reliable.  When I did this I got not one, but two red icons in my task area on Windows XP that would not go away.  Unlike the built-in firewall with Windows XP/Vista, turning OneCare's firewall off does not give you the option to ignore the condition and remove the red icons.  In this way I felt the program was way too demanding to be wanting to do everything when all I wanted was a subset of its features.

Next, I noticed that the backup feature of OneCare and the backup feature of Windows Home Server was not integrating correctly.  The product states that it ""recognizes"" the backup feature of WHS, but I found out that two backups were trying to occur every night.  I searched around some and couldn't find any real documentation or options for fixing the problem.

The anti-virus feature worked well, and in fact seemed to run just a bit faster than my current anti-virus program, Avast.  Updates happened automatically and it was pretty much non-intrusive.  No complaints there.

There were other features that would be handy for novice users, such as cleaning up the temporary files that Windows and IE seem to leave around as well as a feature to scan your system for missed updates, etc.  Again, these are features a novice user might enjoy so they don't have to manage their computer as much.

However, my overall impression was that OneCare is ""good"" but just doesn't make it into the ""great"" category.  I'd say if you have one or two PC's without a home network then this program will work for you just fine.  If you are a more tech-savy computer user then you'll probably find yourself fighting the program more than getting a lot of value out of it.","Good, but not great...",1214870400,,

When Adobe switched to the ""Creative Cloud"" online subscription system (where users have to pay monthly or yearly for a subscription to use Photoshop and Lightroom) I joined many consumers in switching to other applications rather than migrating to Photoshop CC. My concerns were justified when Adobe's Creative Cloud system was hacked within the first 12 months and all the credit card numbers for all subscribers were compromised. That security breach alone guarantees that I will NEVER subscribe to Creative Cloud by providing my credit card information to Adobe.

That being said, Creative Cloud does offer several unique features you won't find in the boxed version of Photoshop CS6 or competitive products. When I saw that Adobe was offering 12-month prepaid memberships to Creative Cloud (so you don't have to provide your credit card information to Adobe) I decided I'd give Creative Cloud a try.

The latest incarnations of Photoshop CC and Lightroom are the most versatile versions of these programs to date and they work together very nicely. I know many photographers who do all there editing in Lightroom and never even use Photoshop anymore, but I'm old school and prefer working in Photoshop and almost never use Lightroom.

I won't go through the 100s of features in these applications (there are many sites and videos online if you're curious about how to use these programs) but I will say this is the best way to use Creative Cloud with the least risk to your personal credit information.

I'm still not happy that Adobe has switched to the subscription method instead of just letting people buy the software once and be done, but if you need to use Photoshop and Lightroom then a prepaid 12-month subscription card is the way to go.","I hate that Creative Cloud is a subscription, but this is the best way to handle it.",1418169600,,

It is, of course, difficult to tell how well any security program is working without intentionally visiting infected sites, which I'm not about to do.  So I'm operating on the assumption that Norton is detecting viruses and spyware as well as Trend, though I have no way of being sure.

My problem with Norton is that it makes everything else run very slowly.  Outlook, in particular, takes forever to open and programs frequently hang.  I have an older PC desktop running Windows 7, but it handles most software without noticeable delay -- or at least, it used to.

Norton also lets a surprising number of pop-ups get through, which Trend never did.  I never realized how many of these Trend actually caught, until it was gone.

I haven't tried voice recognition software in a long time, mainly because it used to take a lot of ""training"" (reading hour-long passages of text while the software learns my speech patterns) to get it to an acceptable level of accuracy.  A lot has changed in the last several years: improvements in voice recognition algorithms, and more powerful home computers have led to software that is impressively accurate right out of the box.  In under five minutes of reading to my computer, I found that the software was giving me near-perfect accuracy.  As a test, I read Walt Whitman's poem, ""When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer"".  I read at a very natural pace (perhaps even a bit rushed), including punctuation, and the software scored 100% for accuracy.

Besides its accuracy, Dragon NaturallySpeaking impressed me with its fairly intuitive set of commands, both for editing documents and for ""getting around"" in Windows and on the web.  Though references are provided to let you know the commands that are available, I found it pretty easy to guess correctly at the commands I needed.  For example, I said, ""search the web for computer science"".  A browser window quickly opened, and took me to the Bing search page to show me the results for ""computer science"".  Preferring Google results, I decided to try ""Search Google for computer science"".  Sure enough, it worked to (as did searching Yahoo).  Then I tried ""search computer for jpegs"" and immediately was presented with a list of jpeg files on my computer.  When I'm not sure what to say, I just need to say ""What can I say"", and Dragon NaturallySpeaking will give me a list of commands.  (And, apparently, I can teach it new commands, but I haven't tried that yet.)  All in all, I found that I could guess the right commands about 75% of the time.

A NOTE ABOUT MULTIPLE USERS: I found it interesting that the software recognized my own voice almost perfectly, but when I handed the microphone over to my 11-year-old son, the accuracy dropped to about zero percent.  Apparently, those five minutes I spent reading must have helped it ""lock in"" to my voice and speech patterns.  I wondered if it would be possible to set up a separate profile for my son.  As far as I can tell, however, the license for this software is bound to ""an individual"".  You, the user, can use the software (even on multiple machines, though not simultaneously).  However, multiple people cannot use the software on one machine unless each gets a license.  Please note that this is my understanding of the license agreement.  Don't trust my interpretation.  If you intend to allow multiple people to use the software, you may want to investigate the exact terms of the license.

Other reviewers say the major difference between all previous versions and X6 is X6 has been recoded for 64 bit. I'm running the 32-bit version. As I wrote in my review of X5 Ultimate, there is little difference between X4 and X5, so they can pretty much be considered the same for contrasts in this review. As usual with PSP, you can run more than one version, even simultaneously. You can also install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions on the same machine.

(Note: running the 64-bit version of PSP doesn't just require a 64-bit compatible CPU, you have to also be running a 64-bit version of Windows. Microsoft doesn't provide a way to ""upgrade"" an existing 32-bit Windows to 64-bit, you have to do a new install.)

As I noted in a previous PSP review, starting with X4 a change was made to the Pspimage format, so if you save in Pspimage format from X4-X6 and try to open the file with X3 or earlier, you will get a ""not a valid Pspimage file"" error. To avoid this you can Save As, select Type: Pspimage and then click Options below the Help button.

I almost exclusively do touchups of scanned books, repair of VERY old photos, and cleanup of photographs of old documents, such as removing ink bleed-through on old court documents from Ancestry.com. X6 Ultimate includes Athentech's Perfectly Clear.  Athentech sells it as a Photoshop plug-in for $199. After the plugin is installed it is accessed by Effects>Plugins>Athentech Imaging>Perfectly Clear

Face Filter Studio 3.0 from Reallusion is also included. Reallusion's website has a detailed description of the program's features, and it is not limited to mainly faces.  This is a standalone program and a major upgrade to version 2. Anyone who does a lot of portrait work might find Portrait Professional more useful, which is specifically for faces.

The video tutorials are a MASSIVE improvement! Help>Video Tutorials. ALL THE VIDEOS CAN ALSO BE SEEN ON A BROWSER at learn.corel.com.  So if you don't need the ""Ultimate"" bundled software and you already have X4 or X5 and don't need the extra speed from the 64-bit version, you won't be getting anything extra from going to X6. Along the same lines, a user named LeviFiction has over 65 X4/X5 tutorials on YouTube.

X6 still does not have photostitch capability (what Photoshop Elements calls Photomerge Panorama), which is not the same as PSP's Photo Blend function. Sourceforge.net has a free photostitch program called Hugin. If you just do photo touchups, etc., then you probably won't care about photostitch. But yearbooks routinely have individual ledger-size photos (17""w by 11""h) that the average home scanner can't handle in a single scan.

Something annoying that goes back several generations is that Image Information for a PNG file automatically displays in metric units and that can't be changed.

X4 originally came with only one workspace color scheme, similar to Photoshop Elements--medium gray on black, basically illegible.  Corel quickly did an update that increased it to four schemes, which it kept in X5. X6 has gone to just dark gray (like Elements) and light gray.  The main menu bar has the Elements color scheme for both options.  I find the menu text a bit small to read comfortably (24"" monitor at arm's length).  In X4/X5, although the type size was the same, with the Light Gray workspace scheme the menu was black text on a medium gray background, which stands out a lot better.  Perhaps with an update they'll add back the other two color schemes and change the main menu bar in the Light Gray workspace. When cursoring over a Main Menu option it does change to black text on gray and the various drop-down menus are black on gray.

One thing I do like about the new Light Gray workspace is that prior to X6, ALL the color schemes had the basic work area just slightly lighter than solid black. Photographed documents (e.g., old U.S. Census pages) often have a white document and solid black background. It could be pretty much impossible to distinguish black in the image edges from the workspace. The new Light Gray option has a light gray work area.

EVERY TIME you click on Help>User Guide (PDF) it downloads the 8Mb guide (224 pages) to C:\users\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp\ -- even if you already have the PDF open. The address where the PDF is located is not stored in the Windows Registry or in an ini or xml file. Several times I opened X6, clicked on User Guide, then closed the Guide and X6, then reopened X6. I wound up with FIVE copies of the PDF in that temp folder. The installation doesn't install the User Guide and create a start menu link to it. So if you want to store a copy on your computer you'll have to hunt it down from the above path and copy it and add your own link.

Corel's website has local help available as a download for X6 so you can access Help when not on-line: From the home page > Support > Patches & Updates > PaintShop Pro X6 > X6 Help files

ORGANIZER: I only started using Organizer recently, to keep track of a bunch of genealogy documents. In Organizer's Navigation panel, data about images in Computer is *not* stored in the Organizer datatbase, it is read from the specified folders. Data about items in Collections *is* stored in the database. If you don't realize this, it can give the impression you suddenly lost DOZENS of tags.

I have X6 running under Win 7 Home Premium and X5 under Win 8.1 Pro with Media Center. The organizer *Collections* database is fully transferable. You can Export the database from one version and Import it to the other to keep them in sync. You have to run Import/Export *within* PSP. However, when you run it it tells you PSP has to be closed. It will then close PSP, import/export, then automatically restart PSP. The export (backup) is stored in a ZIP file. There is no option to automatically  add a date, etc., so it always offers to export under the same filename.

This and a whole lot more is available online utilizing the built in resources family tree taps into.

The really interesting thing is that since it is so widespread that others even distant relatives who have participated and did the leg work to build the tree can be imported into your own tree. The Platinum version includes a six month membership into Ancestry.com which is no small feat because that is about ninety dollars worth of membership. This deluxe version provides 3 months. Even if you bought family tree maker and used it for 6 months you could find just about all of the information that you would need. With the Platinum version the fact that another disc with the platinum version is included in the box to give to someone else, enables you to partake on the journey with another family member, although a second membership into Ancestry is not included.

In using it I found that just like any other application there is a slight learning curve. They included a thick book with it so this is not something you just sit down and become an expert at in an afternoon. That is a good thing because the deeper you want to get into it, the more complex the program becomes.

I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.

The technique is certainly interesting. They do a good job of showing you pictures many times and making you pronounce the word. This package comes with a mic and headphone, although I only used the mic. But when you speak back, the software tells you how well you pronounced the word. That's pretty neat. But occasionally it can get annoying if you think you've pronounced the word correctly and it still says you haven't! For each word they also have a training session so that you can practice just the pronunciation of that word.

There's much to like in this program; however, I've installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: ""it's probably due to spyware"".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!
So, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, you'll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.  It's a real pain!!!
To summarize, there's not enough in this upgrade to justify putting up with these problems (or features, in Microsoft parlance), and I wouldn't have upgraded had I known what I was in for.","A mixed bag...nice features, but seems to bug laden",1067904000,34,

It also makes for a great secondary Windows 7 laptop for trips to my Aunt Wilda and Uncle Eay's house. When we are there it sits in their living room with an external Microsoft mouse and it is perfect for that too.

You see, I insist on optimum software for my computers, so that they can do everything I need. Windows Vista Home Premium on that laptop just was not providing it. It wasn't as terrible as some people say it is, because I spent more money for better hardware. But there were times when I wanted to take it back-and one time I almost did. They didn't accept it though, and that was most fortunate as it turned out.

And yes, I found out that Windows Vista Home Premium couldn't be upgraded in place to Windows 7 Professional. But unlike some people, I had seen that, for me at least, Windows 7 was worth the hassle, and sure enough it has been.

I use Office 2007 on the Professional laptop as well as the Ultimate MacBook Pro, and it has pleased me to all get out. I however don't have any more resources for legal Office 2007, so the iMac will get 2010 Professional through that student offer once I get enough money. Windows 7 and Office 2007, especially on the Professional laptop, seems to be plenty sufficient though-Daddy is the resident March Madness Bracketologist at his workplace and Windows 7 Professional amd Office 2007 Professional's cooperation has really benefited him in that.

I love being able to Remote Desktop the Windows 7 laptop from the iMac or MacBook Pro, although I might have to try Windows Live Mesh from Windows Live Essentials to see if it can remote desktop in Aero like on the commercials.

I like Windows 7 Professional on the former Windows 7 laptop just as much as I do Windows 7 Ultimate on the Intel Macs, considering their respective purposes. Their roles are different, but each fulfills it's role perfectly, and Windows 7 Professional facilitates that in a way Windows 7 Home Premium just wouldn't.

Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:

I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.

I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.

I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.

Update 2-3-2014:

Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.

Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.

For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.

Update 2-21-2014:

The laptop I feared was dead just needed someone to show it was still important and cared for. Once done, it's now back working and let me tell you, I don't care that the laptop I'm currently running this copy of Windows 7 Professional on is 32-bit only and is a Pentium Dual-Core version of a Core Duo with 2GB of memory. I will take it and leave Windows 8 regular edition craptops for those who feel like playing with their digital lives.

Me? I want something that no matter how old, was highly regarded upon release, and not a zoo's worth of headaches from the underpinnings to the bifurcated UI and everything in the middle.

Windows 7 Professional may not have all the features it did when I initially penned this review, but the inexcusable waste of Windows 7 profits to release the Vista 2.0 that is 8 saddens me. It's not quality. And when the interior of the OS is rotten, there's only so much painting the outside edifice of the OS can do.

As a Windows 7 user in the post-Sinofsky era, I can attest to getting the supposedly Windows 8 exclusive of .NET Framework 4.5 in 4.5 SP1 implementation on Windows 7, thus showing that while Windows 8 may have more powerful hardware, you know the fusion of mobile and desktop means more apps running simultaneously and that means systems that had plenty of RAM for a compelling desktop experience in Windows 7 (witness this laptop) suddenly are getting out of memory errors with Windows 8-it's like trying to install Vista Home Basic (not Home Premium, because Home Premium has Aero which Windows 8 of any edition lacks because Microsoft felt it was ""obsolete"" when in reality I still measure a Windows XP or later computer's worth by ""Is it able to display Aero and do so with full 7 drivers?""

This laptop I am posting today's update on may not be much, but I wouldn't take the most popular HP laptop with 8 on Amazon for it, no matter how positive the reviews may be.

End Update 2-21-2014.

Update 2-27-2014:

I configured a spare 1TB hard drive in a $400 Gateway PC that had received a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium from the Family Pack to be a remote network backup destination for my Windows 7 PCs (since the Time Capsule was designed primarily for Macs, which it's cross-platform support is not really there, at least as of the revision that was most compatible with my main Mac, even though it's 2008 vintage) and Windows 7 Professional is busy backing up along with Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade and full install on the other two main PCs, and I am surprised at how easy it was.

A similar update will be posted under Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade.

End Update 2-27-2014

Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):

Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:

I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!

I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?

I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!

I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.

I upgraded to Windows 10, so I don't know if some of the issues I encountered were due to the upgrade, but the box states that Windows 10 is a compatible platform. One disclosure is that I have no GoPro or action camera footage that I was working on. I converted my old home videos to digital MP4 format and this was my primary source material. Many of the video tapes were half full while others had blue screen blanks that I wanted to delete.

First, I could not use the disk that I ordered. My laptop has a disk drive and successfully reads Kaspersky Internet Security disks, movies on disk, and other software I have ordered on disk. Ive never had an issue until this software, so I was forced to download it.

Once downloaded, I could not register the software, so I could not use it. I received a cryptic message (error -24 serial number is used by another email). Users need to email customer service first and wait to receive a trouble ticket before they can call. Once I received an emailed trouble ticket, I tried for more than a week to call a customer service number that I looked up on the Internet but there was never an answer. Finally, I discoveredd a number among the package literature and reached a live person. This person told me to uninstall & reinstall the software. The problem was that during the registration process where I am led along from screen to screen, I had used one email address for verifying registration and used a different one for product emails. This is a no-no, but I could not have known this in advance. So I uninstalled the software & downloaded it again.

Once it was registered properly, I watched the tutorials. I confess I did not wade through user blog forums. I had difficulties because in the tutorial, the sample screen and pointers to items were different than my own product screen. I could not find options that were shown on the tutorial. It was exasperating. Finally, I asked my brother to help me since he is the family movie maker and uses numerous, popular video/film software. He could not figure out what to do to work on a MP4 video during his visit and spent an hour or two fooling with the software features to no avail.

This software has an extremely steep learning curve and is unlike most of other popular film editing software.  I have been at this since May on and off.

Most of my ""serious"" shots are of birds and nature, but I also take urban shots and people.  I'm not interested in special effects as much as I am in correcting small issues that I failed to see when taking the photos.  While this software is designed for professional photographers who take hundreds, even thousands, of photographs in a day, it works well for those of us who want to touch up a single shot or to process hundreds of photographs after a trip.

I have a Mac, and the program has so far worked flawlessly with the OS.  I've used Adobe Elements, and this Corel AfterShot Pro 3 is more powerful and faster than the version of Elements I used.  Although much about the software is intuitive, especially if you've used other photo editing software, you really need to download and read the Adobe manual to get the most out of it.  The manual is a behemoth at 220 pages, so I'm not about to print it; instead, I print out the specific pages that I'll know I'll need to refer to often and merely access the others on my computer.

I love that it never alters the original and instead saves edits in a file with an .xmp extension that keeps the processed photo entirely within the program until I'm ready to export it.  (According to the documentation, the xmp file cannot be opened by any other program to keep it safe within the Corel.) And I love that I can add plug-ins, both free and not, to enhance the editing experience.  The key to using AfterPro 3 is the use of catalogs/folders to organize photos into work groups.  Once you open up a folder, you'll get thumbnails running along the side of your screen so that you can quickly access the ones that you want.  In addition to the standard adjustments you'll find in most budget software packages, AfterShot Pro 3 allows to adjust RAW noise, apply lens correction according to the make and model, access and add metadata, apply watermarks and copyright notices, apply presets such a bluer skies and portrait, and a host of other tools.

The program does a lot more than I need; however, it will allow me to grow with it. I recommend that anyone, especially professionals, considering the purchase of AfterShot Pro to download the Adobe manual from the website to ensure that this will do what you want.

I first encountered this while looking for good software for my coworkers to use to edit short web videos.  These are people, myself included, with regular office jobs who just need the ability to edit video one or two times a year and we keep one computer with graphics software for those occasional times when someone needs it.  We already has access to Adobe Primere, but it is far too busy an interface for someone who does not have a big amount of time to invest at the very beginning in learning how to use it,  In contrast, the Pinnacle Studio line of software has a good balance of having the tools to allow me to do lots of projects while still keeping the interface clean so that it is intuitive and easy to figure out how to do something.  If you want to do serious editing but haven't done much editing before, then this is a good product to get.  Most of the time when I know in my head what I want to do, it is easy to figure out how to do it or to search online and find instructions on how to do it,

Pinnacle makes three editing programs: Studio (in the 60 dollar range), Plus (in the 100 dollar range), and Ultimate (in the 130 dollar range).  The biggest difference is that Plus and Ultimate let you do screen capture as well as editing.  That's a nice feature.  Good basic scree casting software is a must for me.  Another difference that matters is that Ultimate has added features to clean up audio quality.  Other differences don't matter to me as a casual user.  For example, Plain old Studio not Ultimate not Plus only lets you work with 6 tracks at once, while Plus is 24 tracks and Ultimate is unlimited.  That limit doesn't bother me because I'm just doing short web videos and usually just deleting bloopers or doing a little audio clean up.  Pinnacle has a chart on their website comparing the software features.  The most compelling reason to get Ultimate is that that way if you google for instructions on how to do something in Pinnacle Studio, then those will definitely apply to something your product will do.

Overall this is a really great piece of software if you want to do some serious video editing but that is not your full time job.

Since the 2003 and 2004 version of this software program I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer, hanging up of my computer when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I took this bloated software off my computer.

I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.

The problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause.  At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.

He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning.  My uncle called me yesterday.  He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton.  He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing.

So I held my nose and bought this year's version (nice to get the Prime discount from Amazon).  It installed fine, although it seemed to take a long time in the middle while creating the qw.exe file.  Conversions of the old files (I have several, some quite huge) were free of error and trouble, and I was able to delight in the new software that was just like the old.  Note:  I chose to keep my old vault password, rather than doing their cloud thing.  Also, I didn't like the mobile software when I tried it some months ago, so avoided that completely this time.  Probably helped me avoid some problems that others have reported.

The Morningstar X-Ray feature?  Not nearly as complete as the feature you get from M* Premium, but that costs a lot more than Quicken does, so one really can't complain -- it's a pretty nice feature you get for ""free"".  I wish that there were better integration with M*, so Premium members could upload from Quicken and then go to the M* website to do the more detailed analysis & reporting.

The credit score feature?  This seems to be the year's new gimmick.  I get the FICO score from one of my credit cards (free), and the TransUnion score (also free) from another one.  Quicken gives you the Equifax score.  (Someone is offering the Experian score, but I can't remember who that is.)  I decided I didn't trust Intuit enough to share my credit history with them, so I passed.  It's not going to improve my life to know what Equifax says.

Other improvements?  Reporting's the same -- terrible.  Investment transaction handling? Still pretty basic.  You get the picture.  Same old, same old.

============
Update:  Oct 31, 2014

The ""Portfolio X-Ray"" feature appears to be unreliable ...

Today I decided to take another look at what the XRay report was telling me, figuring it would be easier/faster than putting all the data into my Morningstar Premium portfolio manager.  At first I was a little puzzled because the report just seemed to be reporting incorrect information.  So I made sure I selected the right accounts and securities, and refreshed the report.  (It takes a while, sometimes just hangs.)  Still incorrect.  And not minor differences: the bond holding percentage was incorrect, as was the average mutual fund expense ratio.  After some further investigation, I figured out that Quicken isn't correctly submitting the full list of holdings, it's apparently leaving some out -- I noticed that some closed-end funds are missing, for instance.  I can't tell what else is missing, since there isn't a detailed securities list. (Now don't tell me  CEFs are unsupported, they're not that exotic.)

* If you really need windows and don't really need the Mac OS: Then I would stick with a PC.  Only because the Mac has taken a number of shortcuts with their keyboard that will drive you crazy.  Fusion is helpful, but it doesn't replace these shortcomings of a Mac.

* If your primary OS is PC, but you like to use the Mac sometimes.  Then Fusion may be the answer for you.  In general, I would still say you'll be happier with a PC because of the above reasons.

* If your primary OS is a Mac, but you occasionally have to make use of the PC OS.  Then Fusion is definately the answer for you.  Our company supports Microsoft CRM, so our users have to use the PC OS, Internet Explorer 7+ and usually Outlook.  So they can't use just the Mac OS.  But many of our clients use the Mac OS in their environment.  Fusion has given them a great solution for using the Mac OS for most of their work, while providing them with a seamless way to also use Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

The biggest downside: You need to not only purchase Fusion, but you also have to purchase Windows and other related software.

One other aside: One of my co-workers has noticed that the Laptop version of Microsoft CRM for Outlook crashes her Mac when it is running Vista.  Although I did not have this problem, we had to uninstall it for her.","Excellent if you're a ""Mac"" that occsionally has to be a ""PC""",1242864000,,

Some of my favorite quirks from Quicken 2006 & 2007 that I'm glad to see survived the upgrade to Quicken 2008:

Basic arithmetic errors: sometimes, if you edit transactions in the register, every subsequent transaction will get confused about the running total (e.g., change a $10 debit to a $20 debit, and instead of changing the running total by $10, watch in delight and amazement as the running total leaps by thousands, literally thousands, of dollars).

Basic reporting errors: go ahead and open the category list, and click the (very unintuitive) button to generate a report for the category _DivInc. If, like me, you have several years of investment transactions, you're sure to have dividend income, but Quicken will tell you ""no transactions for this category."" Funny, if you type _DivInc into the global search window, it will bring up all those transactions the report couldn't locate.

File corruption: sometimes, I like to imagine Quicken's routines as a bunch of angry little gnomes running around the traces of my processor and through the registers of my memory. This is because, every so often, the gnomes demand a sacrifice, and offer up burnt offerings of your data integrity to their terrible god of woe. I can't otherwise imagine how downloading QFX data from Hewitt Associates confused Quicken so - in the online center, it shows ""number of outstanding transactions: -65,536"" Yep, negative 2 to the 16th power of transactions outstanding.

Probably the worst part about Quicken, however, is trying to free your data. If you've got any kind of complicated financial picture (i.e, if you're over 25 years old), you won't be able to free yourself from Quicken's grasp, since the only way to get data out of the program is in QIF format, one measly account at a time. Funny, they don't support _importing_ QIFs, claiming, and I quote, ""QIF technology is over 10 years old and was designed for technical support purposes . . . QIF Data Import requires many steps to download, is a poor customer experience and can lead to duplicate transactions and errors."" That old technology is good enough for you should you dare to _export_ data from Quicken, however. They're going to make darn sure that you have a ""poor customer experience"" and suffer from ""duplicate transactions and errors"" if you try to take your data anywhere else.",If you're considering jumping into Quicken,1189728000,303,

PROS:
Plays Blu-ray Discs, 3D movies, and DVDs.
Plays other media from your computer.
Can display non-3D video and photos in 3D, though your mileage may vary.
Easy install.
Comes with a very nice pair of anaglyph 3D glasses.

CONS:
Bulky and bloated. Takes up a lot of space and loads slowly even on very fast PCs.
Retail version still has advertisement in the way of little pop-ups that ask you to upgrade.
Slow reaction when it comes to movie controls, sometimes.
Accessing additional controls (interlace, subtitles, color, etc.) is more complicated than other options.

THE DETAILS:
I use PowerDVD 12 for two things: When I want to watch a Blu-ray Disc on my computer, and when I want to watch a normal 2D movie or slideshow in 3D, using PowerDVD's pseudo-3D enhancement. The 3D enhancement really does work, though it is a bit inconsistent and you'll find some things in the background popping out, instead of things in the foreground. It's still a cool effect, and the glasses they include are rather nice for anaglyph 3D glasses; They're plastic, with real hinges on the temples, and of decent build quality.

But when it comes to video playback in 2D, unless it's a Blu-ray Disc, I still prefer to use VLC (VideoLAN) for my movie-watching needs. It's faster, easier to control, and doesn't pester me with pop-ups at startup asking me to look into other upgrades and features. VLC is also free, and gives fine control over the video color, quality, and features in the contextual menu-- Something PowerDVD 12 lacks. You can start the journey toward tweaking controls and appearance in PowerDVD 12's contextual menu, but that just takes you to a large pop-over menu that has limited features.

In short, PowerDVD 12 is made for people who just want to pop in a disc and have it play automatically without any tweaking or customizing. It's not made for people who like to customize their experience. That being said, it's still an excellent way to play Blu-ray Discs on your PC, and the 3D feature is kind of cool for those of us who haven't invested in a 3D HDTV yet.

PowerDVD is well worth having around if you enjoy Blu-ray Discs. If you're looking for something to play video files, photo slideshows, music, and DVDs, though, I'd recommend either VLC or J. River Media Center 16. Both manage these other tasks faster and more efficiently than PowerDVD does, currently, and do it without the nags, retail links, and resource hogging found in PowerDVD 12.

The latest version of Norton Antivirus is simply the worst.  It requires activation, but that's the least of its sins.  Scanning is slow, and it misses lots of trojans and worms.  It also takes up a huge chunk of RAM, and occasionally can crash, esp. doing live update.  Speaking of which, the product installs lots of useless programs without your permission.  In short, Norton Antivirus is a big piece of spyware.

STAY AWAY, STAY AWAY!

And Symantec has the nerves to charge you lots of money for annual update subscriptions.  If you don't update, a reminder will pop up often to remind you not so gently.

Luckily, a free, full-featured alternative exists.  It's called AVG and available from a company called Grisoft (grisoft.com).

I have authored DVDs with other software programs, created titles, added subtitle tracks to movies, combined sources from multiple input media. I have tried Roxio Creator 10, Windows Movie Maker and a range of freeware applications. My objective in this case was to capture, contrast and compare a specific group of scenes from three versions of the same film and burn the files to  DVD with menuing and commentary. I tried to duplicate the same procedures in each of the software packages, starting with WMM and concluding with ULead.  My impressions were ULead was not any more difficult to comprehend than the others but it did offer more flexibility and enhanced features that resulted in what I consider to be a superior end product. I cannot discount that `practice' with the other packages may have rendered this software more intuitive however, I found the GUI as easy, or easier to understand and follow than WMM or Roxio, and I elected to use video editing in lieu of the wizard feature.

While I only gave it a cursory overview, I happen to be a stickler in some areas like documentation so the inclusion of what I consider to be a thorough user manual - albeit in miniscule type size- rather than requiring the user to log on to a website and download huge PDF files is a big plus in my opinion.  On the other side of the ledger however, I could not register the product as I received a pop-up error message informing me I had attempted to register a `legacy version' that is no longer supported.

I did have some installation issues, not with the process itself but rather with outcomes. Installation procedure automatically hijacks default status for copying/playing DVDs, all image display, and contributes to performance degradation by installing at least three start-up applications InterVideoDVD (and this is WinDVD8 while 9 is the current standard), CorelPhotoshop monitor and calls Quicktime, if it is already on your hard drive. It is not an uncommon practice among software creators, what is uncommon here is I do not recall seeing an option during the install to maintain my current default programs. This application seems precariously close to bloatware in my view. I have 4GB of memory, or 3Gb or relevant memory with Vista but when this application is open I cannot run any other  background activities that require higher resource allocation like Outlook.

In the overview, I make mention to useful references and its numerous improvements over the 2012 issue. This should enable small businesses to decide what their company needs.  One of the questions I wanted to know about the AutoCAD Revit LT was what exactly was included in the subscription, something that no one at Autodesk seemed to know.  One benefit, that I found by default was the outstanding access to technical assistance.  I went online, got myself into a queue and received a call within minutes.

Back to the subscription plan before I head off into specs and feature of Autodesk's AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 in comparison to the AutoCAD LT 2013.  There are three levels of support that Autodesk offers via subscription:  Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority.  The subscription included with the purchase of this particular version of AutoCAD Revit LT is the Basic.  If you wish to upgrade your level, you may do so by contacting Autodesk directly, purchase online, or through a local Autodesk reseller.  This was one seemingly simple question that took me several weeks to get answered.  As I mentioned before, the web and phone access to technical questions is prompt and excellent.

All software, regardless of subscription purchase or not, includes what is called Up-and-Ready.  It does include installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables.  You will also receive phone and online resource support.  I'll outline the benefits of Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority.  This will be a rather lengthy review and you can simply skip over the parts you are not interested in.  Just glancing at the benefits will definitely give you an idea as to the type of support and expertise you'll have at your fingertips with a subscription.

SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS:

Enterprise Priority:

*  You will have access to around the clock telephone support for severity 1 issues.

*  You will be assigned a support account manager who will personally support requests, work through escalations, and oversee your account needs.

*  Proactive support services are customized to meet the individual needs of clients, ""including operational assessments and project health checks.""

*  You'll be able to interact with some of Autodesk's senior leaders and get a chance to meet them at Autodesk University and other company sponsored events.

*  If you'd like you'll be able to participate in and offer your input into beta projects.

*  You'll have an Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) professional membership with which you can have access to ""developer support and training.""

*  You will be able to have an unlimited number of ""named callers"" who can contact Autodesk support.

*  You will able to reach back in time and obtain resolution of severity 1 problems in ""previous releases.""

Enterprise Priority & Advanced:

*  You have what Autodesk had dubbed ""Priority Response Targets.""  In other words, you're moved to the head of the line and get answers to your questions quicker.

*  Remote desktop assistance is available to help you troubleshoot and resolve problems that may arise.

*  Support for the application programming interface (API) is available.  You can contact ""Autoface Developer Support with technical issues related to application programming interfaces (API).  I found the ability to access this support is superb.

*  24 x 5 telephone support from Autodesk specialists (access depends on what time zone you are in).

*  You can ""escalate question"" on an online community support forum.  Immediate assistance is available.  It definitely is because I tried out this feature.  My question was not one that could be answered, but I was pointed in another direction with phone numbers.

*  You can access updated ""webcast training seminars,"" a must if you encounter problems.

Enterprise Priority, Advanced, and Basic:

*  Phone support from Autodesk during local business hours, once again dependent on your time zone.

*  If you try to access online community support and do not received a response within 24 hours, your request is escalated.

*  You have access to web support via community support forums and you can ""submit requests"" through the Subscription Center.

*  There is an online knowledge base ""containing a wealth of valuable information.""  For example, there are several online videos and tutorials.  Some are on the Autodesk site while others can be accessed through YouTube.

*  You have access to Up-and-Ready which includes installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables.

I did receive a Comparison Matrix, something that you probably won't receive when you order Autodesk AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 or AutoCAD LT 2013.  This comparison really gives one an idea between the capabilities each has to offer, information a small business needs to know prior to investing in one or the other.  AutoCAD LT 2013 has only four of the features, two in documentation and two in collaboration.  I've decided replicate the Comparison Matrix (Copyright Autodesk, 2012) below, making note of the features AutoCAD LT 2013 has in parenthesis.

Autodesk Revit LT 2012 and AutoCAT LT 2013

Comparison Matrix

DOCUMENTATION

There have been numerous improvements to AutoCAD 2013, some very subtle such as a minor font size increase to major ones such as the ""Annotation Monitor"" and the addition of Cloud.  Some of the improvements are simply blips, but I've outlined what I can see so the individual users can decide for themselves whether or not they want to purchase or upgrade

Hopefully, a simple overview of new/improved updates from AutoCAD LT 2012 and previous editions listed below will help make your purchasing decision.

WHAT'S NEW:

+  A new ""Welcome"" screen (once called the ""Exchange""). It is indeed welcoming and helps you quickly access your work.  There is also quick access to Facebook, Twitter,and AutoDesk360.

+  The ability to strike through text, leaders and dimensions (documentation), in addition to bold, italic, underscore, and overscore.

+  The command bar has been relocated to the bottom of the screen.  It is interactive only when you work.

+  A current history ""floats"" above the command bar (you can undo easily) showing what you have just done, including dimensions.  As you work it will gradually be removed.

+  You can draw and your line(s) will go behind the bar to the bottom of the page sans interruption.

+  ""Annotation Monitor"" was added.  This helps correct your drawing scale.  You can make notes, annotate, scale, you can associate dimensions, etc.

+  There are now options for the radius of a circle that can be accessed by typing C + enter.  You can specify the center point or radius and click your options (you no longer have to type them in).

+  The 3D modeling tools have been improved with greater detailing, including section views.

+  The history can be accessed by hitting F2.

+  DWG file format.

+  A preview is available before you execute your work.  For example, if you want to add color you can move your cursor over one and the result will be captured on the screen.

+  There is now the ability to layer and view your work with transparency (preview is available).

+  The font on the task bar is jumped up a notch.

+  You now have the ability to download ""Language Packs"" (English, Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Russian, Czech, Polish, Hungarian, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Vietnamese .)

+  A ""Computer Clouding"" system is available.  You can access your files anywhere as they can be saved via a free AutoDesk 360 account (sign up, access via Welcome page).  You can save all automatically by default or by individual choice.  You can sync your projects from home to work.  Rendering can be done here.

+  2D model documentation from your 3D AudoCad or Inventor models.

+  You can access online resources through the Autodesk Exchange Apps (many are free).",The AutoCAD revit is an excellent choice ...,1355011200,,

This might've been fine a few years ago. At this point, there are just too many services out there that'll happily give you 5+ GB of cloud storage to use as you please for free (including Amazon itself), and I've played with several of them to compare against this and they're also better.

Obviously this is more than 5 GB, but you can get good deals elsewhere on similar amounts (or more) with better interfaces and support.

There ARE significant benefits to this kind of thing over using an external hard drive. You should definitely have external hard drive backups, but also having one stored somewhere else entirely will save you if, for example, someone breaks into your home and steals your computer AND the backup drive.

This also sits in an awkward size range... a few GB is plenty generally for something like sharing files between your computers, sharing photos with family, and keeping basic backups of documents you want to access regularly. But you need a lot more than 25GB if you're going to back up an entire computer (complete with applications and your media files) typically. So 25 is sort of way too much for some purposes, and nowhere near enough for others.

I'm also sort of hesitant about how secure they really are. I don't see anything in the product description (and didn't notice on the program) about exactly what kind of encryption they're using... if any. I don't know if things are being encrypted before being transmitted or after arrival or not at all or what.

On the whole I just... this isn't a complete disaster, but I haven't been able to come up with a scenario where I would tell someone ""This is your best option.""

Edit: By February of 2014, I'm seeing Google throwing in 100GB of Google Drive space with Chromebooks and 50GB with a Moto X phone.

Second - milk your MS Money Plus for as long as you can - it's more rational than Quicken, has a simple straight-forward presentation, and is easier to navigate. It's also more utilitarian for multi-national investing.

That said, Quicken has lots of bells and whistles, the data transfer from Money is fast and accurate, (of course, there are occasional anomalies, but a LOT better than starting over from scratch!) and learning the new layouts is fairly easy. For global investments, it's weak - you can't automatically update prices on shares listed outside the USA, and exchange rate updates are so far a mystery. Matching downloaded transactions from banks to entries made manually or automatically (not waiting for the download) is problematic if they've been reconciled.

As a long-time user of TurboTax, I look forward to an easy transfer of data from Quicken in 2011 - using a .txf file to transfer data from Money was never satisfactory, especially for foreign accounts and rental properties. There's a tax planning tool, into which you can import Turbotax data from prior years, but it's not good for complicated tax situations.

Presentation of data is clean and relatively intuitive (sorry, couldn't resist!) and navigation is simple. Account abbreviations from Money don't work, but that's just a niggle.

Being thrown out by Microsoft is just another reason to hate them, as there is but one reasonable alternative so far - Quicken. You'll be able to cope, but keep your eye out for a better mousetrap.

**** have been lowered to ***  The program is more work to use than MS Money by streets. Definitely not a productivity-enhancer versus MS Money Plus.

Mice keep getting into this program - for no apparent reason, downloaded quotes do not correspond to the on-line quotes of the source, and the program is flummoxed by the switch in ticker symbols for US options. After making manual entries, the program intermitently overwrites the price quotes for no apparent reason.

Banking is a pain - if you manually enter your check transactions as you go, when the bank download is done you'll need to manually accept each entry - and if your bank puts ""Check No. 1145"" into the payee box, you'll have to accept the duplicate entry, re-edit to show the correct payee, delete your original manual entry, and clear the blue air around your PC.

Getting news and individual stock quote information is a convoluted process that will make you long for Money Plus. Foreign currency transactions are a painto enter and control, and exchange rates are automatically corrected - another manual transaction has to be entered to correct back to the exchange rate actually experienced.

Recommendation :  Hang on to your MSMoney program until your last reasonable moment - it will save a lot of aggravation. In the meantime, pray that someone comes up with a more effective tool and scares Intuit into fixing this monster. The premise of Quicken is good, and the basic operations are great, but it is stuck in second gear when it comes to handling investments, rentala properties and foreign transactions.",Fairly good alternative to MSMoney Plus,1270857600,3,

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,,

I've done Pimsleur in Spanish and Italian and a little bit of German, but this is the first time I've tried Rosetta Stone. It beats the Pimsleur aural method hands down. Pimsleur comes at you on a one-way street. They repeat phrases over and over again and you try to repeat them back. You can't even see the words you're trying to say. You just listen and repeat. If you don't have a fantastic ear for language, you're going to have no idea whether you're even coming close to repeating the original.

That being said, this is much more expensive than one Pimsleur set. If you can afford it, then go with Rosetta Stone; if not, then try the Pimsleur. In fact, before you buy Pimsleur, see if it's available in your local library. Take it out and try it before you plunk down the money for it. Personally, the visual cues, variable targets and pacing, and voice recognition for speech perfection in Rosetta Stone make it worth the extra money for me.

I took one semester of German in college, 34 years ago. That gave me a little familiarity with the language structure. That was then reinforced by 15 years of working for or being associated with German-owned companies, and the 30 or more trips to Germany I've made over the years. I picked up some of the language, but it was a pidgin version of German, interspersed with a lot of English words and helped a lot by the very courteous way in which my German colleagues helped me get a little closer to saying things the right way.

So I had some background. But when I sat down with the Rosetta Stone/German package, it was the first time I felt immersed in or surrounded by verbal cues, visual cues, and instantaneous translation. This really worked for me. I don't learn that well by just listening.

You get license to install on 5 computers in the same household for a price less than two individual copies of Snow Leopard.  And the OS itself is fantastic, below is my review of the OS itself:

I installed the family edition tonight on two laptops, a MacBook and MacBook Pro. It is immediately obvious the new Finder is worth the price of admission alone. Finder windows open and close quickly, there's no annoying pauses and hangs. File copies are dramatically faster; no more need for power users to use a third party tool or drop into Terminal to copy files quickly. Time Machine backups are indeed faster, my old applications still work fine. When I opened a PowerPC app that needed Rosetta, Snow Leopard went to the Internet to download Rosetta--no need to dig out a DVD.

My primary applications--Photoshop CS3, Dreamweaver CS3, OmniGraffle Pro, PowerPoint 2008, Word 2008, Flex Builder, Eclipse, FireFox, VMware Fusion--all seem to work just fine.

So I see no reason not to upgrade: The speed improvements, the painless installation, and most significantly, the much-improved Finder make this a bargain of an upgrade.

And that's ignoring all the cool technologies under the hood (discussed in other reviews) and the small details that have been added (signal strength icons of wireless networks in the AirPort menu, for example).",Family pack is a fantastic value,1251504000,7,

I'd seen really good reviews for this game, but I was still kind of apprehensive because it's such an old game, I thought the graphics would be really horrible. But I was surprised at what a quality game it is! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4.5/5: Nancy's ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle she's staying at. Apparently in the 1920's, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinette's castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so it's up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped. But overall, I was impressed!

CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The characters include the castle's caretaker, Dexter, who is very defensive and has a dark past, and Jacques, a famous French skier who was actually really fun to listen to. The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.

SETTING - 5/5: I loved the castle!! It was huge, I got lost plenty of times just trying to find my hotel room, haha. But there was tons to explore. Plus I was surprised how good the graphics were. I thought they might be kind of shabby because it's an older game, but I was way off. And the music was really nice, some of the best music I've heard in a Nancy Drew game.

PUZZLES - 3/5: I felt there was a serious lack of puzzles in this game. Maybe this came out before Her Interactive got the idea of putting in ""filler puzzles"" to make the games longer. It was kind of nice not having to do a puzzle every second, but I do want to have SOME puzzles. There were probably less than a handfull of puzzles in the whole game, wich must have been why it was so short.

IS IT CHALLENGING?: No. Like I said before theres only a few puzzles, and everything else is pretty easy. I'd give it a 2 for challenge.

ENDING - 5/5: The ending was good. It made perfect sense with the rest of the plot. The culprit isn't a surprise, but catching them was fun.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 4.5
Characters: 3.5
Setting: 5
Puzzles: 3
Challenge: 2
Ending: 5

Hill,"""Corel AfterShot Pro"" is a very powerful imaging program that is likely meant to compete with Adobe Lightroom, and it does so nicely in most regards. We are avid photographers and take hundreds of pictures every year, both for personal use and for professional product photography (which I also teach). While I do like Lightroom, it is fairly expensive and much more processor intensive than AfterShot.

AfterShot installed cleanly (upgraded the first time it ran) and runs very nicely on my aging desktop. The workflow is very intuitive and those familiar with Lightroom and other imaging software will have very little trouble navigating around this software.

The program recognized the RAW files from my Pentax dSLR but surprisingly it also recognized that several of my older pictures were taken with a FujiFilm camera and automatically populated the correct ""Lens Correction"" information, which was a nice time saving touch. The editing tools are fairly basic compared to dedicated image manipulation software like Photoshop and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-PaintShop-Pro-X4-Ultimate/dp/B005HTIWIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate</a>, but are perfect for the corrections needed in a photo management software. The ""Noise Ninja"" is one of the more powerful tools and it does a great great job cleaning up the photos. The program would benefit from more presets and hopefully Corel will address this in future updates.

This is a very viable choice for those wanting a powerful, yet affordable image management solution.
