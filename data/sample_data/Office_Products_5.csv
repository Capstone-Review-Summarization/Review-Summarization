- The texture keeps the printer from laying down ink 100%. Some paper will peek through in places.
- Any parts of the pre-cut paper, if it's not laying flat, has a chance of getting folded in the printer. I've had it happen to me.
- Avery provides an online web label creating program with lots of creative choices to make dynamic labels without having to use a fancy program of your own on your PC or tablet.
- Each sheet is 4 x 6 inches and holds 3 labels each.
- Labels end up getting printed off center. You may want to take the time and extra scrap paper to get the scale and position correct before printing on the tags.",Great labels for crafting with less than perfect alignment issues to deal with.,1443571200,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WLViJXTQL._SY88.jpg']

The scanner works better than I had hoped. It's fast and it simply works. We scan copies of contracts, mail, delivery receipts and virtually every piece of paper we handle. We file those documents according to job, client etc. Once filed, we have access to the documents over our network and via laptop & iPhone while in the field. No longer to we have to lug files of paper around to job sites. The only down side so far is that when we need a printed copy of a document we have scanned while out in the field, we are creating another piece of paper by printing it in the field and that often gets tossed after it serves it's purpose. Like I said, we gave up on becoming paperless a long time ago. The software makes the scanner all the more versatile.

The o-ring lock system allows you to make it as tight or loose as possible - I really like that.  the spacers and additional longer screws allow you to really tailor this to your specific needs and keys.

Well, since I was already at home, I figured i would go big anyways, and settled on the Brother Wireless Digital Color Laser Printer.  So far, I'm impressed with what I got.  The Brother Laser Printer prints out pages perfectly, and with speed that my inkjets never could muster.

In terms of size, this unit is definitely not a little desktop printer to share with your PC/Mac/Laptop/etc.  This unit can hold almost a full ream of paper in it, and it houses these huge ink cartridges totally unlike the little inkjet packs.  Prints come out very quickly in this unit, and all the prints are crisp and perfectly colored.  There are no visible streaking, horizontal printing line, or any imperfections that I can see on the prints.  This unit auto duplexes, so I don't have to baby sit it when printing items on both sides of a page, and this unit can scan/copy pages easily.  One thing I do miss on this unit that was available on the inkjet 3-in-1 is the auto feed for the scanner.  This isn't a huge issue for our household as we don't need to scan multiple page documents all too often, but keep this in mind if you do need to scan items frequently.  For those who need to utilize the fax functions, this printer also doesn't have that feature.  Again, we didn't need it in our household, so we didn't miss it.

Maintenance of this minimal - simply change out the cartridges when they run out, and maybe occasionally run the printer maintenance function.  If you don't print for some time, you don't have to worry about ink jet nozzles clogging up, and you don't have to worry about shutting off the printer because it goes into sleep mode perfectly.  This printer hooked up easily to the wireless and stays connected well, and I'm also able to print off my iPad and iPhones without issues - this is something I struggled with constantly with my older printer, and those functions alone make it totally worth the cost.  The printer works very quickly and quietly, and getting to work with the many computers (both PC and Mac) was seamless.  I can't say anything regarding the longevity of this printer as of yet, but I'm expecting that it lasts longer than 3 years simply because it seems to be very durable and well built.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the Brother Digital Color Printer.  It's fast, quiet, and the prints that come out of this unit are clean, bold, and bright.","Outstanding Prints, Auto Duplexing, but Scanner Doesn't Have Auto Feed - Still Love It Either Way",1503878400,20,

Obviously I checked the reviews first and they were all exemplary.  I bought this a few weeks back and I use it to hold documentation related to the latest project I am working on or my daily to-do list.

To be honest, I didn't even know that these things existed. What is especially great is that it is up and off of my desktop, at eye level, and doesn't add any more clutter to my desk.  If you need it to hold many pages, it will do that as well and the mounting took about a minute and it holds rock-solid!

I couldn't be happier with this Amazon purchase and may even buy one for the other side of my flat panel display.  One great feature is that it swivels in case you want to hide it behind the flat panel display but I can't see myself ever doing that.  Another benefit of the swivel is if the side of your flat panel monitor isn't at least 3/4"" thick, you can just attach it to the back of your monitor and just swivel it!  My flat panel display in my home office is only 1/2"" thick so I couldn't really attach it to the side of the monitor but could easily just attach it to the back and it would work just as well. That's why I am contemplating buying one for my home office as well.

Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.

The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the design

For the labels, there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.

Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.

Tagboard is a good idea. This tagboard comes in 20 sheets of four bright colors. Each sheet is a bit bigger than a standard piece of paper that you might use in your computer printer or for a typewriter if any of you still has one of those.

I tried several media on one of these pieces of tagboard and none of them showed bleed through. The media I tried are inks for stamping, colored pencils, regular Crayola crayons in construction paper, metallic, and standard format, Sharpies, gel pens, metallic markers, and cheap markers. All worked well without smearing.

Just use regular glue to attach a standard piece of paper to the tagboard and you have a simple frame created.

I love the room inside of it, but the hinges and arm are definitely iffy. As other reviewers have stated, there is some wobble when you lift the cover of this lap desk. I'm not so much concerned that the hinges will fall apart as I am about the arm that lifts the cover will eventually break. Because that arm is so thin and flimsy, I fear it will be sooner than later. Yes the cover will still lift without that arm, but the hardware used on the lap desk is very cheap. Everything else about it is perfect, it's lined with a nice green velvet with plenty of storage. I have approximately 25 pens and pencils stored on the left side along with large erasers and I'm able to fit my iPad, Apple keyboard, 8.5x11 notepad and rhyming dictionary in the other side with room to spare. It's just the arm and the looseness of the hinges that gets to me every time I lift the cover. For the price of this lap desk, then manufacturer definitely could've done better.

=== The Good Stuff ===

* The bright neon colors worked great in my shop. They stood out against the dull grey steel that makes up most of my cabinets, and the writing showed up crisp and bold (see below). The labels had a reasonable amount of adhesive on them, although I almost always laminate these sorts of labels with a good thick grade of clear tape to protect them.

* Of the two labels cartridges in the box, one worked fine in my labelwriter, the other was problematic.

=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===

* One of the label cartridges was a problem from the beginning. It just did not want to feed correctly, and my label text usually got garbled and mashed together. After about the 50% point, it started feeding just fine, but if I had paid for this cartridge, I would have been furious.

* Compared to the white labels, these are pretty expensive. Not sure that I have an application that really demands that level of cost for more visibility. You might.

* The 10' label length was a bit of a problem. That is not really all that much, especially when you waste half of it just trying to get the labels to feed.

=== Summary ===
If you really need fluorescent labels, these did work fine. The print quality was good, the adhesive worked fine, and they seemed like they would hold up, although I laminated mine as a precaution. For my use, the cost would be somewhat prohibitive. The improper feeding was a bit of a disappointment, and I assume Dymo will fix this going forward.","Work If You Need Flourescent Labels, But Some Bugs To Work Out",1437523200,,

I needed something  to organize essential items I need near me that were cluttering my space.  These little white plastic organizers did the trick and I am very happy with them.  The one in the living room holds my calendar, important correspondence I have to deal with, scotch tape, paper clips, lens cleaner and a small Boogie Board that has a magnetic back but since I did not have anything metallic near my chair I could not hang it.  This board is what I write on with its stylus to remind myself of important things I have to do or jot down telephone messages -- when I have taken care of whatever is on the board I push a button at the top and have a clean slate again.  It is great but no use having the board if I can't stand it up where I can see it and I keep it in front of my correspondence.  In the bedroom I have 3 small remotes for the TV -- one in each of the back three back areas.  I put my glasses and some tissues to see me through the night in the largest space and in the front I  place my little remote for the radio, my spray for my asthma, and more lens wipes.  Everything is neat in both places and just think how awful all that stuff would look on my tiny tables without this wonderful little organizer.  I searched for hours on Amazon until I found this and it was so perfect I purchased two and I am so glad I did.  The items were well packed and arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  The wells are not deep enough in this organizer to hold my big remotes for my cable TV and my Samsung TV in the living room but since I have three shorter TV remotes and one very tiny remote for the radio in the bedroom.  There is even room for my Kindle Voyage reader in the wide space where I put my glasses and some tissues in the bedroom -- ensuring that these two breakables will not get knocked off the table and land on my ceramic tile floor as I grope for a tissue in the middle of the night.  If you need a desk or table orgaizer, check out the mDesign Desk Organizers -- I chose the one with 7 compartments but there are others with different configurations that may be just what you are looking for.  I love the clean white plastic material, the openings at each end so you can easily carry the organizer, and the smart, modern look to the plastic that is very sturdy.",These little white plastic organizers did the trick and I am very happy with them,1455235200,,

It was fairly easy to set up on my wireless network at home. You can do everything directly from the printer, if you know what you're doing, and then just add the printer to your computer once it's hooked up to the network. If you need help you can download a software package from Brother's website (or from the included disc), that guides you through the process. I did find the process of registering it on Brother's website to be a bit frustrating. At first it didn't recognize the serial number -- I had typed the letters in the serial number in upper case like they are printed -- but then I tried typing them in lower case and it recognized it. Even though it did recognize it, the system still asked me what the product was and then after everything it gave me an error message saying that it couldn't register my printer at this time and that I should call customer service... at that point I gave up and maybe will try registering it later.

Otherwise it is a breeze to use. The menu is easy to follow and options are easy to adjust using buttons on the printer.

It comes with a standard yield toner cartridge built in. You just have to remove the protective seal and it's ready to go. It's really the efficiency of the cartridges that is the selling point for me on this. If you buy the Super High Yield Toner Cartridges, at their currently advertised price with an expected yield of 12,000 prints per cartridge, that comes to about a penny per print plus the cost of paper. That's a pretty astonishing rate. Given that this also will print double sided, and thus save paper, it's an extremely efficient printer.

It's really designed for an office that prints a lot of documents. In my house, though, we have three kids in high school and both parents are teachers. Believe me: we print a lot of documents and go through a lot of ink, and a lot of paper. We have a color ink jet printer, but keeping ink supplied in that can get very expensive. Since most of our documents can be black and white, this is a much better solution, and one that looks like it will last a very long time. We now just use the ink jet for when someone has to print something in color.

This comes with one paper tray that holds 250 sheets of paper as well as a second paper tray that is optional. We decided to install the second paper tray so that we could have two different sizes of paper available, but probably didn't really need that second tray since there's also a manual feed slot for when you want to print something on specific paper or on something that already has something printed on it. One frustrating feature is that when the second tray is out of paper, the system tells my computer that the printer is out of paper. So I get that warning every time I try to print something. It will still print, just from the other tray, but it still gives me the error message until I put paper in the second tray. I went online trying to see if there's a solution for this, but I haven't found one (other than to keep both trays full of paper, or, as I may end up doing: remove the second tray because for our use one tray that holds 250 sheets should really be sufficient).","Prints high quality double-sided or single-sided monochrome docs quickly, and is easy to set up on a wireless network",1458432000,6,
28589,5,True,"03 12, 2009",AGAHIHVVDJZQ6,B00006B7QO,,Ray,"From my experience, if you are using a Brother laser printer, you're better off using the OEM toner rather than third-party refill toner. I have tried third-party toner from three different sources for a DCP-1000 three-in-one (scan, copy, print) laser printer which is now about five years old. In two of the three cases, the toner did not work (faint printing). The one that did work is apparently no longer available, and the amazon price for the Brother toner is better anyway. Now, third-party toner for Brother products, especially the tn250, has dropped to very low levels. I would be very cautious about using non-Brother toner unless it had some kind of warranty. In one of the above cases where I did experiment with a third-party toner, not only did it not work with the Brother DR250 drum, but it also ruined the drum, making it unusable even with a genuine Brother toner cartridge. At the time, the drum was much pricier than it is now through amazon, so it was a costly lesson to learn. The reason I bought the Brother machine then was that it was more affordable for the quality and features it offered than a similar ""big-name"" machine. Nowadays most printer manufacturers offer a variety of machines at various price points with varying features. Brother's appeal is still the cost-effectiveness of its consumables, such as the tn250.",can't go wrong with OEM,1236816000,2,

HP ink cartridges are notoriously overpriced.  The photosmart plus a decent machine but drinks more ink than a drunken sailor drinks. The cost to keep replacing the ink makes this machine not worth it! The only way to stay out of the poor house with HP printers is to buy aftermarket ink to refill your cartridges. HP protects against this (because they dishonestly make their cartridges run down so fast) by not allowing the computer chip to be reset (can someone out there make a device to do this please). So, you can use aftermarket ink to fill your cartridge but you won't get a read-out on how much ink is left...this is really annoying.

Buy this if you want more desk space, if you want the monitor out of your way sometimes, or if you like your monitor very close to your face for close up work.  Why use a monitor arm for just one monitor? to double your space!!!  Check out picture 1 vs. picture 2.

I have a small 48 x 32 inch desk in my room so I can handle 3 AM phone calls without going to the office and schoolwork.  Desk space is a premium.  With a monitor stand I have a fixed configuration which means its a pain in my lower back to move anything or reach past the monitor.  With the ARM in place I can just push it out of the way without touching anything else.  It sounds small, but it is huge.

Now I can get up close for engineering drawings and push the monitor back for college multimedia presentations. I have space for a book, notepad, phone, or whatever I need to get the job done.  I would recommend this for any person with limited space.

The ARM is big and beefy.  I find that I have more adjustment than I need, but you have to position it correctly.  I tried the back of the desk first, but found the ARM (any ARM) will be a maximum of about 17 inches and a minimum of 12.  Placing it centered on the left side I can pull it 17 inches forward or push 17 inches back which is the full depth of my desk. Also, I can fold it out of the way flat along the left side.  In all cases it takes ZERO desk space.

You may need to tighten the bolts on ANY ARM you buy.  Moving parts move.  I have to remove a trim cap to tighten one bolt so keep the wrench that comes with the ARM.

For the price point, it's the best budget-friendly fountain pen on the market. I read many of the reviews and found most of the complaints are from people who've never use a fountain pen before and/or how easy it was to ruin the appearance of the pen. For $14, it's an impressive fountain pen when compare with OTHER FOUNTAIN PENS.

Pros:
The Japanese fine nib is comparable to us, westerners, extra-fine nib, or 0.5 mm mechanical pencil.
The nib does not run dry, unlike most Asian pens for a low price, and was ready to use without any adjustment out of the box.
Writing with the pen feels very smooth and does not skip.
The weigh of the pen is very light with most of its weigh being in the front and cap rather than in the barrel.
The design is minimalistic and perfect for daily use, such as school and work.

Cons:
Capping does throw the balance of the pen off by a bit. It's not an issue with me, but you should keep in mind if this kind of thing bothers you.
The converter is okay. It's great in term of quick refills, but it lacks accuracy and precision. I recommend getting a different converter, Pilot Con-40 or Con-50. Rumor has it the con-50 is magical and will make you look smart and sound prettier, also it's the community favorite between the two.
If you prefer the cartridge because you hate money or find your time to be too precious to waste, it's a little bit stiff to remove the cartridge. Some ink may splatter, if the cartridge is not fully empty.

Conclusion:
I highly recommend this pen to new fountain pen users, budget-tight spenders, or those who want a beater pen for daily uses. I am a first-time user of this pen and will be a lifetime user.",Cheap does not always mean bad,1515196800,,

The printer is a little noisy. It does a lot of resetting. It also will not work unless every cartridge has ink, which is ridiculous when only printing in black ink. So if I have plenty of black ink and am printing only in black ink but one of the color cartridges is out, the printer will not operate.

The major issue is the cost of the ink. The average price seems to be almost $50 for the 5-pack combo and $20 for a black cartridge. With tax, the cost to replace the print cartridges is over $70. That is unacceptable.

In these bad economic times, it is hard to justify this expense. I'm looking at other options. If I can get a good deal on another brand and the ink is cheaper, I may be much better off in the long run.",Cost of Ink Outrageous,1260144000,,

So right now I cannot print with Magenta at all and Yellow is inconsistent.

Besides the clogs it sometimes has problems with the paper feed. It spits out a blank page and tells me there is no paper. Sometimes it grabs two at once.

The cost for ink is outrageous as well. The printer seems cheap enough for a medium quality one but to buy just one more set of ink cartridges you will spend more than the cost of this printer. Also, if you run out of one color of ink you cannot print at all. So run out of yellow and you cannot even print out a black and white text document.

The reason I give this two stars instead of one is because for the few months it worked well.

I had already had an idea in my mind as to how I wanted to set up the room and tables, but receipt of these cards made the planning and executuon easy.
I was able to use this, the medium size, to provide large print instructions and hints for the game in play at a specific table. I loved not having a piece of paper cluttering up the gaming surface..the tent card was unobtrusive and sturdy and easily moved around table as needed by players.
I have never used Avery's printing setup function (have always used Word), but decided to give it a try given the multiple shapes and sizes of projects I needed to get done.
It took me a bit to figure things out, but once I did, it was smooth sailing. I was very impressed with how nicely the ink laid down on the cards, smooth and quite elegant.
The cards are miscroperfed and do leave what looks and feels like a fuzzy edge. Because of that I would not use these at a wedding or formal function.  But I think they are perfect for in-house business meetings, training sessions, or recreational gatherings.

With Fisher pressurized cartridges, which tend to reqire a pretty fair ammount of downward pressure (even for a ballpoint) to keep a consistent line, this is not really an issue. From writing quality and ease of use standpoint, the bold is definitely the way to go imo if you use Fisher Cartridges. The down side here is simply that they are a little tougher to find, and not readily available in all colors (I use red ink at work and have yet to be able to find a red bold Fisher refill). Also they don't always fit as well in some non-Fisher pens. But all in all this is still my favorite width for the Fisher cartidge.

So, I decided to go out on a limb and try a non-HP cartridge.

On installation of the printer cartridge the HP application that controls the printer refused to see a new cartridge and insisted that it was close to being empty. However, I was still able to print, and the print quality of the cartridge was just as good as the HP ""branded"" cartridge. After about a week, the HP application tells me that the cartridge is empty and it then refuses to print... anything.

After doing some online reading there is apparently a chip that HP adds to the cartridges so that it recognizes whether or not you're using one of their cartridges. I tried some of the suggested online fixes but nothing worked. The HP application refuses to acknowledge anything but an HP branded cartridge.

While I hate that HP can extort users through the use of technology I'm also not thrilled that this non-HP cartridge wasn't manufactured to work on an HP printer in the same way an HP cartridge would have.

It quickly shreds handfuls of paper and cuts them into very small pieces.  The sensor-stop feature works well, preventing cats and kids from getting their little paws into the slot while it's shredding.

This is a HEAVY shredder.  You won't want to carry it around the house, so make sure you place it in a convenient spot from the get-go.  We use a paper grocery bag inside the bin to catch the shreds and then toss it into the recycling like that.  Couldn't be easier.

Updated January 2009:  This shredder is still working beautifully after two years.  We've had to add oil one time.  We've shredded reams and reams of papers and many CD's and credit cards.

I am still using the original screen protector and it looks like I'll get a few more months out of it. I'm guessing the supplied pack with last the life of the Zire.

The case never gets in the way and helps with minor bumps. I've done a couple of full-drops onto tile with no damage. Certainly, this is because the Palm is tough, but the case also helped.

It is also pretty useful to have the Palm be just a little ""sticky"" for when it's on the dash or whatever.  However, this MAY cause it from not sliding easily into a belt or planner case. (Mine is nylon and is no problem.)

Lastly, I so much prefer having a case with no moving parts. My old Palms (M100 and family) had a ""flip top"" screen covers and this new method is a little simpler and, thus, that much better. The beauty of Palms is simplicity.

What's the point of a two-pack? It seems like the one will last as long as the Palm.  (Maybe if you took it on-and-off a lot, it might develop a tear.) If two colors are going to be supplied -- how about a ""boring business"" color like white and a ""bold fun"" color like bright yellow for casual use? A white one and a pale blue are about the same. White and black may also be a consideration.

-- ORIGINAL POST --

While it's not the same as a case, it is a very good solution to give your Palm that little extra protection it needs, when you're actually using it.

I still have a case for keeping it on my belt, but I like that it's got some protection when I have it out, using it. That's when I'm most likely to drop it.

Just to follow up, I received the gold one and was surprised that it actually looks fairly decent. You definitely want to put the cap on the back when you're writing as the weight seems to be in the cap and that keeps the pen balanced nicely. Hand position seems a little far back as tip of index finger rests on the ridge between front (silver) and back (gold) with 2nd finger supporting the gold part.

First, after a period of use the combination of drum and toner develops a number of miscellaneous squeaks, groans, and moans, possibly indicating breakdown or failure of a lubricant in a moving part.  It's a little worrisome but they will last to the end of their normal life and the noises go away immediately with new drum or toner.  Second, on a Brother printer everything is fine until you try to print duplex.  After the first page, the of the front of each page has about a half inch band of gray toner with no apparent way to fix it.  Again, this may be the printer and it's age, so am mentioning it in case others are seeing it.  I have another printer I can use, so not a serious problem.  But if it were a problem I would install Brother drum/toner-- would probably find that it is indeed the printer, but the printer is out of warranty and repair would cost more than a new printer ( some things never change ).

This printer came quickly via USPS with free shipping. Easy to unpack. Removed all the blue tape, followed the setup instructions and installed the ink. All easy to do. Installed the software, which took a bit of time. Then connected the USB cable to my PC. I will use this printer for the same purpose as the HP, to print CDs. Well, I have used a program called Sure Thing CD Labeler Deluxe for about 5 years. So I gave it a shot with my new Epson. Nada. After running five CDs through using Sure Thing, all with very badly offset results, I finally took a look at the software that came with the printer and that was installed on my PC. Lo and behold, Epson has program called CD Print. So I went about configuring a new label for CDs I sell and following the directions exactly as supplied by Epson, produced a perfect CD!  So, I am back in business.

This printer is very compact, and the control panel, which has a myriad of options and nicely colored graphics, is quite sensitive, which was a bit of a problem for my big fingers, but, with a little practice, I got the hang of it. It requires virtually no pressure to change from one selection to another. I will probably give the scan feature a try soon, but I have another scanner that works perfectly, so that is not a priority.

Bottom line: For about $100.00 this is a very good printer. I think it will do what I need. The letters and graphics on the printed CD were deep and crisp, which is a good thing.  I have no idea how long the the ink will last, but that is not an issue at all. I'm happy with this, and that's what counts.",A lot for the money,1426032000,2,

I like not burning batteries so I like that it comes with an electric adapter. I sharpened a Ticonderoga yellow pencil with it and it did a good job. It's pretty loud compared to some manual crank handle type sharpeners that affix on the edge of a table.

It sharpened the pencil to a fine point, it's a slightly squatter shorter point than some sharpeners. I have a Panasonic electric sharpener too, it sharpens the pencils to a longer taper and longer points. The drawback of that type of taper is that the points tend to break more easily, so this type of shorter or less tapered point is better for color pencils or softer pencils.

I also have a manual sharpener where you turn the handle and it clamps to the table and that one does a good job but it depends on how fast you crank the handle. It is a lot quieter though. Overall, I will give this sharpener 4 stars for its performance as it sharpens well, has a nice stable design, and takes 2 widths of pencils. The shavings collection chamber is also pretty large. I took one star away as it is a bit noisy, and also it does move around on the table as there is no suction on the base.

It was finally time to get better organized, and I figured one of these boxes would probably just hold a year's worth of financial records (and, I was right, these were the perfect size), so, I ordered up two of the four-packs, and I now have each year in its own box for the required ""past 7 years"" of records to keep on hand, and can easily rotate in the newest year, and shred the oldest year, annually now, using these boxes over and over each year.  I created a changeable label for the lid, so this is a very affordable one time buy for a long term need.

The best part?  No more office clutter!

These are super easy to build -- they just fold into shape basically, with clear instructions and a bit of applied intuition -- and they are very sturdy.

They are very strong, easy to carry thanks to built in handles and, in general, is just everything I was wanting for archived paperwork.

Assembly is relatively easy, as you are just putting a few of the big pieces together.  Then after you get it together, you really need to take the time to adjust it to yourself and your workspace.  Get the tilts, angles, and adjustments all set.  This may actually take a while, as there are several adjustments.  This is not a bad thing!  The better adjusted the better you will feel, or better yet not feel.  Because when properly adjusted, sitting in this chair feels natural.  You feel like you are sitting, but you feel fully and properly supported.
Now is this worth the asking price for this chair.well that is up to youhow much time do you sit?  How much can go wrong form a chair that doesnt really support your body and provide comfort.

Totally worthless, if you remember.  These erasable pens are the real deal.  They leave absolutely no trace behind once you have erased, which is great for art projects.  These are also great for crossword puzzles, logic puzzles, and any kind of puzzles where you may need to erase.  In my opinion, these are much better than pencils.  The ""eraser"" on the end is not actually an eraser.  It is more of a dull, plastic point, if that makes sense.  This means that when you do need to erase, you will not disturb the paper at all.  The eraser does not affect the paper - the paper stays flat, and the marks disappear.  I use these pens daily, as does my daughter.

Upgrading from and older 2.4 GHz was a revelation.  I didn't realize how much static I had been dealing with.  And the range is impressive too -- I can talk on a handset while walking to my mailbox whereas before I lost the signal after stepping out the front door.  The looks of base station and handsets are very modern and stylish and the design of the phones is well laid out and easy to use.  I have an ooma VoIP system at my house and it plays almost perfectly with it (see below).  Handset loudspeakers are a nice touch, as are the custom ring tones.

Even with all the pluses, there are some negatives.

- The satellite handset has no phone cord so I can connect it to one of my ooma scouts.  I neet to by a separate handset if I want to use my second line from the satellite handset.
- The blue light while cool is awfully bright and not something I would want in my bedroom at night (our phones are in other rooms).
- Each hanset needs to be programmed separately.
- The user programming interface is really awful.  It took me a while to get the phones set up and I consider myself a techie.

But now that all is set up I am enjoying and using this phone.  Even with its quirks, I would not trade it for another phone.

EDIT: March 2011 - The phones seem to have reached the end of their life. They no longer charge fully and only one handset is usable, and that one only when using the speakerphone. The system worked well for about 3 years but now I'm on the market for a new set to use with my ooma system.","Excellent Signal Clarity, Great Features",1210636800,7,

The pen isn't overly weighty and it feels good in your hand. The ink flows smoothly and the pen glides effortlessly across the paper without applying much pressure which means less hand fatigue when writing large amounts of text. And the writing is more vivid than a ball point pen.

These pens are great for signing cards because there are no stops like you get with a ball point pen on the glossy/slick surfaces of some cards. The ink dries quickly, too, almost instantly, and so you don't get smudges.

The only drawbacks to the Paper Mate Flair is that if you leave the cap off they dry out and if you get the paper you've written on wet (rain, spills, etc.) the ink runs. You also cannot use highlighter pens over the top of text written with the Paper Mate Flair because the ink will smear/run.

I wouldn't use the Paper Mate Flair to write/sign checks, legal documents, or for anything that you need to stand the test of time, but for all other writing purposes including note-taking, lists, rough drafts, letters, card signing, etc., the Paper Mate Flair is an excellent choice.

PROS :
*Light weight pen that feels good in your hand; glides effortlessy across paper without applying much pressure; less hand fatigue when writing large amounts of text
*Ink flows smoothly and consistently.
*Writing is more vivid than a ball point pen.
*Ink dries quickly; no smudges.
*Felt tip is reinforced with metal so that there is no breakdown/fraying.
*Has a pocket clip that can be used to attach pen to clip boards and writing tablets, etc.
*Long-lasting pen with large ink supply.
*Comes in 16 colors and medium or ultra-fine tip.

CONS:

CONS -- photo printing not great, no wireless connection, nozzles susceptible to clogging, setup snags, no cord included, no PictBridge interface.
SUMMARY -- it does what it says, but consider other models also.

This is a basic stripped-down printer (no wifi, no scanner, no USB cord, etc.) that has the advantage of being able to print on large paper.  This makes it easy to print off a poster about something, a large map to put on a wall, personalized gift-wrap, a large page which is folded to make a custom letter-sized folder, etc.  However, if you need a large format printer, there are others in this price range to consider (from both Epson and others) which provide more features and/or better quality photo printing.

It prints text documents fairly quickly, however, it prints photos rather slowly.

If you want a quality photo printer, this is not the printer for you.  When I printed the same photo on my years-old HP printer and this, the Epson photo had weaker colors, and fuzzier edges and lines, and slightly different (worse) color balance, no matter what paper was used (I tried premium papers from both Epson and HP).  At a glance, my not-too-discerning partner immediately noticed the difference between the photos printed on the two printers.

The ""DuraBrite Ultra"" ink that this printer uses is their basic general purpose ink (it is not one of the special inks for artistic applications -- search for ""Epson Ink Solutions"" if you want to know more.)

>> Documentation:

The behavior of the printer setup didn't match the documentation (I am using Mac 10.6.8).  After installing the ink cartridges, it was supposed to begin the priming process, but after about 15 minutes (during which I was prowling through the software and documentation) I checked the status, and it said that the cartridge types were not recognized.  That was fixed by turning the printer off and then back on.  Again, when printing the first test page, it hung (with a communication error), again remedied by a power cycle.

There were other important things lacking (or mismatching) in the documentation:
- Apparently small-sized papers go only in the top drawer, according to the marks in the drawer itself, and the software size options for drawer 1 versus drawer 2.
- The printed instructions said to shake the cartridges, tear open the plastic, and install the cartridges.  Hmmm, there are some little yellow plastic strips which say to remove them, the instructions don't mention them, but I guess I should.  Then later the online documentation said not to remove anything or ink would leak.  Huh, which is it?  (It seems to be working fine, with the strips removed as they themselves said to do).

And, there are a bunch of important things buried in the bottom of the the outline structure of the documentation.  Things like how to set the paper size in the two drawers, how to turn on or off paper-size mismatch checking, etc.

SECRETS OF PRINTING IN BLACK: One of the really important things to know about this printer is how to force it to keep printing in black, even if you run out of a color: bring up the guide and search for the ""Expended Color"" for details.  Otherwise, once you have run out of any ink color, all printing is disabled.

>> Concern About Nozzles:

I have avoided Epson printers for years, because of prior bad experience with constantly clogging nozzles.  With Epson printers, you don't get a new print head with each ink cartridge replacement - while this is cheaper in the short run, it can cause problems in the long run.  In the past, I would have to constantly run nozzle checks, have to waste ink ""cleaning"" them, and have to resort to alcohol on a q-tip because Epson's own print head cleaning procedures were not adequate.  ETA 2/2014:  Overall, the nozzle situation is much improved, but it still merits consideration.

Basically, before printing anything, you should run a nozzle check to make sure none of them are clogged.  Every time.  Sure enough, with this brand-new out of the box printer, a nozzle was clogged.  Often this will fix itself with another nozzle check, but it did not, so I had to waste ink by running the nozzle clean procedure which did fix it.  But then later in the same day, before printing another photo, again a nozzle check showed another clogged nozzle, but this time, a second nozzle check fixed it.  It remains to be seen whether this current printer will have constant nozzle problems, or whether Epson's priming and cleaning procedures have been improved over time.

ETA 2/2014: After six+ months of disuse, when I needed to print on large paper, only a few nozzles were clogged -- not surprising after that amount of disuse.  It needed only one cleaning cycle to clear them for printing.  After printing a few large (18.5x12.5in) photos, one nozzle reclogged near the end of the photo, but fortunately not in a critical location.  Overall this is much better performance than I have had with Epson printer nozzles in the past, though it shows that it is still something that merits checking.  If you're printing small snapshots, or text, not much ink is wasted if you need to redo one.  But if you need to redo something large, that is lots of wasted ink.

One annoyance if printing on large paper (e.g. 13x19in) is that large paper needs tray 1, but so do nozzle checks (as far as I can tell).  So you have to pull out and resize and reload tray 1 over and over, switching between expensive paper for the large print, and cheap office paper for the nozzle checks (but better that than a wasted large print).",Basic Large Printer; poor Photos (how2 force black-only if color empty),1335657600,43,

Considering its price range when it's on sale (and it usually is), the Epson WorkForce WF-3640 is a great printer-scanner-copier-fax.

I've used this all-in-one to scan, copy, and print from a PC, a Mac, an iPad, an iPhone, and an Android smartphone on letter paper, envelopes, and photo paper--even from the Cloud, when I was out on assignment nowhere near my printer--with no problems whatsoever. I love that it has two trays that I can set up with whatever I most commonly need to print on. For us, that's printer paper and envelopes. I love that it has a place in the back where you can feed any paper into it, so I don't have to remove the paper and envelopes from the drawers when I want to scan a copy of a check onto an invoice, for example.

You can scan individual pages on the flat bed, or you can feed a bunch of pages at the top to scan them. Again, this works great. I haven't encountered any issues yet.

The only part I haven't used yet is the fax, but I've set it up with my company's name, and that was easy. I know it will work just fine the next time I need to send a fax (which probably won't be for at least a few months).

As far as Avery labels go, of course, this thing can print Avery labels! It's just not in the list of presets on the touchscreen, but you can set the dimensions on the touchscreen under ""User-Defined."" You can--and actually must--set up your label in Word or whatever alternate word-processing or art software you're using. Avery has templates for Word that you can download and use. I'm guessing that's the same for other similar programs. Just go to Avery dot com forward slash templates to download the templates. The URL is right there on the package of any Avery label.

The only cons I can see are that this all-in-one is significantly larger (particularly taller) than the one we had before, so it needs more space above it, and that the standard setting for ink is actually an economy setting, which means you save ink at the possible expense of your eyesight and at the expense of the quality of printed photos. Of course, you can fix this by switching to a higher print quality setting. Both the scan quality and the print quality at the highest settings are very good, although print quality at the standard settings leaves something to be desired. (Printed photos have miniscule, almost invisible, dashed lines running across them in this setting.) One automatic setting I love is double-sided printing. I'm guessing you can turn that off, but I haven't had a need to.

I love how intuitive the touch screen is. I can stick in an SD card or a USB drive, view photos on the touchscreen, and print them easily. I love how the system does just about anything I could want an all-in-one to do rather well. And I love the price.

495654,3,False,"05 13, 2013",A221I9R7I92ORO,B00AGV7T5W,,IRG,"Preface:
It's difficult to evaluate any printer solely on its own merit, without comparing it to all the printers one has used before, especially if the prior models were both photo printers AND all-in-ones as is the Canon 5420. It may not be ""fair,"" but that's the way it works: Nothing exists or is purchased in a vacuum.  The best-performing models we previously owned or used become the benchmark(s) we use when evaluating what comes afterwards.

This means we also have expectations based on prior usage. With a new model such as this, there is the expectation, for example, that it will be better than models that preceded it, be an improvement over what we owned before and have newer and more relevant features and software. We also expect that it will be as intuitive and easy to use, if not more so, than older models.

Sadly, such is NOT the case for the most part with the Canon 5420.

After using close to six inkjet and laser all-in-one printers from companies such as HP (I'm still mourning the ""death"" of an HP OfficeJet I had for close to six years that was one of the best featured and best values (in terms of the cost of consumables and the cost of individual output), Epson, Canon and Brother, I think I have a good frame of reference for how these units perform and am very familiar with operation panels, setup and with their many features. I've used all kinds of software that comes with them and was able to quickly and easily set them up (including those that were networked) and upload pix from various media. I also did a lot of family album photo printing and scrapbook printing, and used the many creative options available on these units. I also did a lot of photocopying of color photos and magazine pages. In other words, I worked those units to see how much they could do creatively and to see how the photo quality/print quality varied when outputted on various sizes and types of photo and other paper.

On the same day that a five-year-old Canon all-in-one inkjet we'd been using in my home office (one of two printers and NOT the primary one) up and died (the dreaded BR 200 code that can't be fixed without spending more than it costs to buy a new unit and wouldn't even justify repair if only to save us the the cost of the just-inserted five cartridges that are now stuck inside PLUS our backup cartridge inventory.), I had the chance to use and evaluate this new Canon model.

First Up and cutting to what many consider the most relevant feature of a dedicated photo printer:

Canon 5420 Print Quality: This is always highly subjective since we average home office or home users are not employing scientific-based tests. It's not bad but it's not as good as I got on other, older, non-photo printers, from both Canon and HP. It's better than some of the prints I've ordered online and worse than others.

If you're using this primarily for personal and family use, and like to fool around with different sizes and types of formatting, and aren't looking for color accuracy, this could be a good niche printer for you. If you are also willing to spend a bit of time to learn the features of the software and various print options, you'll be able to do some fun stuff with your photos right in your home.

Is this printer for you? Perhaps, if you are...
>Someone who is looking for a specialty photo printer and will use it primarily as a dedicated photo printer.  Someone who wants or needs the ability to print photos onsite and on-demand (as opposed to ordering online or using the service or self-service options at various photo and other types of retail shops that offer these services.)

>Someone for whom convenience of photo printing outweighs the cost for the black and color cartridges used on this model.

>Someone who doesn't really do a lot of text printing and is not concerned about text quality.

>Someone who has a lot of patience to wait while it warms up and either prints or copies. (FYI: I'm not sure why, but highest quality photos printed faster than even the lowest-quality simple page of text. How can that be? I dunno. Never happened before on other printers.)

>Are OK using non-intuitive/less user-friendly operation panel and software.

>Want a unit that allows you to AirPrint and/or print wirelessly from you iPad, iPhone or compatible Android devices.

>Can actually use a lot of its featured software (Auto Photo Fix II, Easy-WebPrint EX, Image Garden)and are willing to spend time learning how to use it.

>Actually want or need, and will use, its various features. (Read thru both mfg description and reviews.)

>Want to print directly onto CD/DVDs (although I can't vouch for this as my unit was missing the disc tray that holds these in place and others have indicated that the options for printing are limited)

Cons: For my purposes, they greatly outweigh the pros. This may be different based on your needs and usage.

>Constructed of shiny plastic that easily attracts dust and dirt and shows every finger and other print.

>That shiny plastic seems very fragile and easily broken if you are not very very careful with how you handle the flip-out paper tray (for output) and the two pull-out paper trays below it. It also looks as if it would break in a heartbeat if you banged a stapler or other office tool or other item against it or dropped it on it. (And when a material is fragile it seems that even the most careful folks have accidents.)

>Paper trays hold very little paper.

>Non-intuitive/less consumer friendly operation panel on the unit. (I hate it with a passion especially compared to all the others I've used.)

>Non-intuitive, bloated software.

>Onscreen user guide that leaves much to be desired in terms of content and organization.

>Slow, slow, SLOOOOOW printing, no matter whether highest quality or fastest option. SLOW photocopying and scanning. Honestly, it tried my patience because I'm used to fast scans from prior all-in-ones. And I've never had an AIO that took so long to do even a black photocopy!

>Slow warmup. Noisy startup when you first turn it on AND then every time before it prints or copies.

>Cartridges that are costly, hard to find and not yet available in compatible form.

>A network setup that would be tough for novices. (It's easier to just connect via USB and then if you need to share, do so on your existing WIFI network, if you have one.)

It took me two trys to correctly answer / input what I needed and I've set up wired and wireless networks in our home office using all kinds of equipment.  It did however, work wirelessly on the first outing, a plus if you want to place it away from your computer.

>Did not ship with the special disc tray you need to print on CD/DVDs. (Didn't even know this until I went to print and saw no way to secure the disc. Then checked other reviewers and the online guide.)

Pros:
>>Low-profile; less bulky than a lot of all-in-ones (Note: There is no auto paper feeder.)

>Two separate paper trays, so you can keep one (top) filled with smaller photo-size paper while using the bottom for standard letter-size paper.

>It was not noisy as some have noted. Maybe that's because I opted for a quiet mode that appeared when I did setup from the panel.

>It says it can print on DVD/CDs. I wouldn't know as it did not ship with the necessary disc tray!

>Wireless networking worked first time.","SLOW, not always user-friendly, one-trick pony w pricey consumables, per unit print costs",1368403200,9,

To be honest, if I just glanced quickly and saw the price, I might not have given it a second look. I'm glad I read about the notebook first before seeing the price. The title can be deceiving. It is far more than a simple 5-subject notebook. Here's why.

Positive Features:
5 subjects
Wirebound
200 college-ruled sheets
Perforated sheets that tear out easily
Pages are 3-hole punched
Highly durable front and back covers (made of poly) that are still flexible -- this would easily last all year for a student or even a teacher (or for any other purpose for that matter)
Plastic dividers (5) with multiple pockets for placing papers, etc
Plastic dividers are different colors so it's easy to find sections you need
Spiral Guard protects wires and helps prevent snags and bent wires (very helpful) and is actually made of fabric
Notebook itself is available in several different colors
Exterior loop for holding a pen

I am not easy on my notebooks. I have birds too! They have a hard time getting to the interior of this if I leave it out by accident. I have actually packed and moved with this notebook and for the last few months have been living out of boxes. This notebook has withstood all the wear and tear I've placed on it.

Here are a few things to keep in mind. It is on the pricey side. However, it is durable so you won't have to buy a replacement for it. Second, keep in mind that it is 5 subjects and is made of sturdy materials so it isn't as light as other notebooks. However, you probably won't need many (if any) others if you are using this one. You have 5 subjects or sections, a place for a pen, and colored dividers with multiple pockets for holding papers. So keep the features in mind when considering the price and weight. The only other potential negative is something other reviewers have referred to. The pages are very thin, so you might want to check the pen you are using in a corner first to see if it bleeds through (such as a gel pen or marker). Most regular pens seem to work fine -- at least from my experience.

Overall, I would highly recommend this notebook for just about anyone that has a need for its many features. I normally won't spend this much on a notebook, but I will spend it for this one because of its quality and the features it offers. I have black and would love to purchase one in another color.

As more of an entry-level multi-function printer, many features require a lot of work to set up and use.  But because of the great value provided by this unit, plenty of people will be willing to accept the extra work required to use all the features offered by this model.

PROS:
++ Built-in wireless allows you to easily print from any wireless device
++ Great auto-document feeder allows for easy automatic workflow for scanning, etc.
++ AirPrint compatible for your Apple devices (like iPod Touch, iPhone or iPad)
++ High quality scanner is low-profile, adding functionality without bulking up the unit
++ G3 fax integrated into the unit
++ Also includes basic copier functionality
++ Optional Bluetooth unit allows for direct printing from your digital camera
++ Good value printer given all the features and the small footprint

CONS:
-- Wireless and feature setups can be time-consuming
-- Using many features, like duplexing, requires manual user intervention
-- AirPrint setup requires time-consuming firmware update
-- Inkjet cartridges will add cost over time, compared to alternatives
-- Switching between regular paper and photo paper is required, because there aren't separate trays
-- LCD screen can be difficult to read, depending on your viewing angle
-- Shiny plastic attracts dust and fingerprints
-- Included software, while effective, is large and split between too many applications
-- Very limited memory interfaces (USB is included)
-- Overall feel of the printer does not seem durable

CONCLUSION

This is a good value for the features.  If you have very little desk real estate, it's nice to get a built-in scanner and fax machine to go along with your printer.  Being able to switch between photos and documents is a nice extra too.  But there are too many things that limit this model.  I would definitely recommend moving up to a better model if the budget allows for it.  If you just need a feature packed entry level unit and you don't mind the extra effort it takes to use it, you could do worse than this model.

The adjustable power is fantastic. And this size staples are useful for all sorts of things. This stapler is solid and definitely gives my Arrow and Dewalt some stiff competition. I used this weekend to tack some lines, and repair a (christmas village) fence. So its pulling its weight already.

That being said, like any stapler of this time it can be difficult to aim, and even with the adjustable power, it can still go much further in than you thought it would. Between those two issues I'm not sure I would use it on cabling that wasn't hardened on the outside to protect it from both missed staples and those pushed to far in. Unless they invent staples with a little padding on em, or rubberized maybe? I'm just not gonna do it.

But I can't take any points off of it, as I'm just a weekend warrior when it comes to fixing up the house. Maybe in the right hands--ones much more skilled than mine--it would serve its advertised purpose. But even without that, I still think its fantastic.

They also have a high-end digital medical scale at the office and it weighed me 0.6 more than this scale. I find it to be accurate and not have too many false readings. With any scale one is going to have a false reading here and there. I really like that it syncs up to my fitbit profile and it eventually gets sent over to MyFitnessPal. It's great way to keep track of my weight and BMI. I always forgot to record my weight from my old scale. My old scale consistently was all over the place with my weight and always weighed me heavier than the Aria scale when I made the comparison between the two.

I will be keeping this scale for a long time. Set-up was very easy. I only had an issue because I have MAC Address filtering enabled on my router and I had to turn it off temporarily so the scale could connect and add the wireless settings to the scale properly. Once that was done I added the scale's MAC address to the filter and enabled it and the scale works flawlessly.

(FYI: I have a latest model Netgear AC1600 (R6250) router that is not only Wireless B/G, but Wireless-N, and Wireless AC. The scale connected to the router just fine. You don't need ""old technology"" to use this scale. Take some people's inability to get this scale connected with a grain of salt. Some may have been valid issues, but most probably don't have enough technical knowledge to get it working. I bet a lot of their routers are set to wireless-n only and that is the reason why they can't find their own network.)",Great Scale!,1395446400,,

So I did some looking around at paper shredders and found this one. The reviews all seemed pretty good and the price was right.

So after getting it I found out it comes in two pieces, the top and the basket part. All you do is pop the top on and your done. I put a little plastic bag in between the two for easy clean up when the bag gets full. I liked how it holds a lot of paper so you aren't constantly having to empty it out. Also although it doesn't shred them micro sized I liked how it shredded them at an angle so if someone would try to put them back together it would be very difficult since they aren't just all straight on the end. Finally I really liked how this was one of the only paper shredders I could find for  a cheap price that can handle shredding staples and such. Also It can handle around 6 pieces of paper at once and I have never had it jam on me yet, and if it ever should there is the reverse switch to un jam it.

So far, the item is fantastic.

Having said that, I would not recommend paying full retail for any Palm Pilot. The manufacturer's warranty, even if the item is new, lasts only a year. And all too often, quirky electronic items like this die within two years.

So I got mine used, on eBay for a mere $82, including shipping.

The Palm One Tungsten E2 is larger than the Zire 22, and heavier. It fits more snugly into the Palm Pilot leather case. It also has an electrical charging adapter and a slightly different sync cord than the lighter weight model. In addition, the Tungsten E2 allows for blue-tooth and/or infrared synchronization.

In the best case scenario, if this item lasts at lest as long as the first one did, it will more than pay for itself. At this point, I can't live without automated reminders of appointments and chores, as alas, I don't have a secretary or assistant.

I couldn't figure out the difference between Sticky Jack Glue and Sticky Ass Glue. They are made by the same company and they have the same picture on the bottle. Finally found my answer on a website about airplane glues: ""Sticky Jack Glue, which we introduced last fall, boasts the same incredible bonding strength of Sticky Ass Glue, but comes with a brand name that is more appealing to a select group of retailers and consumers."" Ah, marketing.

I have used this glue on a plastic latch on my bathroom mirror, which I clamped overnight. It is a very strong hold. In fact, I'm impressed with how it holds up against the stress of the mirror opening and closing on it everyday. It bonds plastic very well, and that's what I normally use it for. It's great for repairing toys.

The best thing about this glue is the tip doesn't clog, unlike some other super glue bottles I've used. It sits on my shelf for ages and it's ready to go when I need it.",Great on plastic,1296518400,2,

I use it in my office as an everyday printer, and I chose this particular model because of what I perceived to be it's photo printing abilities. It makes excellent photos and makes speedy print-outs in the fast/economical mode. I'm very happy with the purchase. If it had room for the 3 ink cartridges I use (black, tri-color and tri-color photo) instead of having to switch the color when doing photos, it would be more convenient, but not a major problem. I just try to set aside a time when I have several pictures to print and do them at the same time. The paper tray has a tendency to eject multiple sheets at once when printing in the fast/economical mode for everyday paper printing. It's less so when the tray is full. I would purchase it again. Although the instructions are almost non-existant and don't cover this, I have found the printer works best if the feed rollers are cleaned occasionally with finger and/or dry cloth. Otherwise the buildup will pull little bits of the photo finish off of the paper, leaving white spots in the print.",Very good printer for my use.,1293494400,2,

There are tons of electric sharpeners on the market (I have tried manual sharpeners, but my daughter finds them difficult to use, getting pencils that are not well sharpened so a manual sharpener was not what I was looking for) and after reading numerous reviews on various brands, I settled on this, the Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp6.

I've used it for a week now, and have been happy with it. It isn't exactly quiet though, there is some noise, but not as loud as other electric sharpeners I've used. The plus side to this is it sharpens a pencil quickly and you can tell that a pencil is sharpened when the resistance level is reduced - just a few seconds in all. The dials for various pencil sizes allows for large and small pencil barrels. The tray is huge which makes this convenient as it doesn't have to be emptied out frequently - great for classroom use, and in our case, for personal home use. It has little suction cups on the bottom which makes it easy to adhere to any surface. I hope it has a longer life-span than my previous electric sharpener and will update after a couple of months of use. For now, I am satisfied with this brand.","So far, so good - not loud, and sharpens well",1353024000,,

Build quality is very solid, and similar to that of its older brother, the -845.  The only difference between the two seems to be the -845's larger 500-capacity feeder tray.

Printing quality is impressive.  Text and images are sharp/crisp/clear, and noticeably faster than my last inkjet HP printer.  The all-in-one functions are extremely convenient, obviating a run to Kinkos for those extra functions.  Xeroxing works great.  The one downside is the considerable footpint and desktop real estate required to store it.

Overall, I highly recommend this product, especially for those who are less technically inclined and are looking for a reliable high-quality, low hassle printer.","Perfect, easy to setup",1331856000,,

Pros:
1. Keeps all your keys together, including USB drives.
2. No jingling.
3. No catching on clothes or purse.
4. Don't have to worry about sharp keys scratching your hand as you fumble with them trying to find your house key.

Cons:
1. I couldn't seem to operate this one-handed. Meaning I'd have to sit in the car and get my keys ready, then get my groceries out of the back while trying not to let the keys accidentally close.
2. It takes two keys to get into my house. So add that to #1 and now I've got my keys making an ""L"" shape.
3. When in the ""L"" shape, the key sticking straight out the end is easy to turn, while the other key, at a right angle, is awkward to turn.  Yes, I could stop and adjust them, but that takes even more time. (See #4)
4. The time it took to get my keys ready before getting out of the car plus the time to adjust (using the free hand that I don't have) the keys so the second one wouldn't be awkward to turn took way too much extra time getting into the house.
5. In order for the Fan-Key to feel secure, you have to tighten the screw, making it difficult to open and close the keys. I used my husband's last night and I actually couldn't pull any of the keys out - it was too tight.  I didn't keep mine that tight, but it was still difficult to open the keys. I'd have to use my fingernail (feeling like I was going to break my nail) to open my keys.

I realize that this may be the perfect solution for some people, but it just didn't work for me.  So I've decided to keep my two house keys on the ring with my car key (which wouldn't fit on the Fan-Key) and I've removed the rest of my keys from my main key ring and consolidated them onto one ring.  I tied a ponytail holder around them to keep them quiet and now I can just drop those in the bottom of my purse.  I only use those once or twice a year anyway.","Maybe good for you, but not for me.",1418601600,4,

As someone who has setup many printers both professionally and for personal use I was surprised with the lack of assistance coming from the Samsung package. Usually when you open a printer's packaging you find a quick setup guide. Well other than some cryptic illustrations on the inside of the box flap, there wasn't anything to help. This was disappointing but I pressed on as I've set up many printers including many Samsung lasers. I've personally owned four Samsung laser printers over the years, this is number five.

This is the first one that gave me trouble. After getting it out of the box, I knew enough to get all the packaging and tape off. I followed the big arrow marker to take out the toner and pull out the plastic strip to release the toner.  I then put the printer in place and connected the printer to my router with a NOT SUPPLIED Ethernet cable. No cable is supplied for USB either, which is the alternate printing method.  I loaded up the CD and started to follow the directions for the install. Everything seemed to be going well but when the install finished it never asked me to print a test sheet. I found that odd even though it found the printer on my network.  I proceeded to print a Windows test page. When it wanted a file to print to I knew we had failure. I went through trouble shooting but I couldn't assign the proper IP address for the printer.

I decided to uninstall the driver and software and start again. For whatever reason this time the installation completed with it asking to print a test page which successfully printed. Yay! I couldn't figure out why it failed the first time but am glad it worked on try number two. Now it's time to try out the printer.

The first thing I noticed is the printer is shaped like a cube, mostly smooth sided all around. Other Samsung lasers I've owned had a protrusion where the paper extended past the body in the rear. This only extends there, if you use longer paper. There is an internally housed 250 sheet paper tray. This makes for a neat and tidy appearance. There is a door flap that hides the envelope feed shelf. The exiting paper tray flips over the top to protect it from dust. The interesting thing here is if you forget to open the flap, a single or a few pages will slip through. I didn't send a big print job figuring it would eventually jam. Still it's nice considering it's a workgroup printer and you may not see it to know the lid was closed. Personally I think a sensor should have been there and the driver should have told you to go open the lid.

 My previous Samsung laser used a green light to show it was on, this 2955 uses a blue and brighter light. If you have this in your bedroom, like I do, say hello to your new night light. Even in Energy Savings mode this light stays on. It is on top in the power button, it projects a light onto the ceiling. When it is printing the noise level is most acceptable. When it duplexes it makes a little bit more noise as it shuffles the papers back and forth. This is the first duplexing (prints on both sides) laser I've ever owned. My ink jets do this but it's of limited value with ink (bleed-through). With toner, I see myself using this feature a lot more. It is rated at 29 pages per minute. While I never achieved that it is fast and prints the first page in less than ten seconds. Overall it's a very fast, quiet printer. Because of the duplexer it's just a little bit taller than my older Samsung laser, the ML-2525W. The duplexer was my main reason to try out this printer. Other than the initial false start it has proved to be a very good printer.

There is an iOS app for printing from iPhones and iPads. It's not an AirPrinter so it's a bit clumsy and you can't print everything. Better than nothing, but Samsung should have made it AirPrint capable.

 I will update this review as I get to use the printer more and test it's usability a reliability. For under a hundred dollars it's highly recommended, just be extra careful on the install and redo it if it fails.",Touchy install but eventually works well,1341532800,8,

It does not automatically ask you what type of scan, or file, or save where.

You can think of it as a thin backpack that you carry like a binder, but it's better than a standard backpack since it can open all the way flat. The zipper around the three edges lets me throw in all sorts of papers, books, and clutter from my desk in a hurry without having to worry things are going to fall out.

The inside of the front cover has an accordian pocket with four slots. The inside of the back cover has a half-width vertical pocket to secure loose pages while keeping them partially visible, as well as smaller pockets on top of the half-width vertical pocket you can use to help organize such items as pens.

It's large enough it can fit a full-sized laminated sheet of copy paper (approximately 11.5"" x 9.25""). I've started printing out and laminating some of my favorite recipes. I've found I don't like the way it looks 3-hole punched and in a binder, so I wanted somewhere I could keep them bundled together as plain sheets. This zipper binder would work nicely for that.

When filled out, the edge of the binder is about 2"" thick. That's the perfect width for me to be able to grab it with one hand. If it were any thicker, I would want a strap along the edge to help me pull it up off whatever it's sitting on.

One pen worked through highschool because of the size of the refills inside.

In college, an engineering major again had similar demands, just more of them.  So I bought another one.  Back then they were white top and blue bottomed - again contributing to the geek factor!  But, images aside it was useful with scheduling conflicts (calculators were lucky - we didn't have laptops) by using one calendar and one color for each subject.  I kept a calendar of FINAL EXAM dates since they never lined up - this method allowed me to, from the beginning of the quarter, see when time conflicts would arise even for just normal exams so I could dedicate my time where it was needed most.  (we did not have pocket cellular phones with calendars then either)

Now I still find the 4 colors helpful for general notaking.  All of the ink quality is top notch and dries quickly without smudging (years ago green was finicky - not today).  Best of all, the pen is now all black leaving that geek factor behind. No more blue/white pen.

The black on white LCD display makes it really easy to read the display especially when compared to amber or blue LCDs.  The audio is crystal clear.  Talking Caller ID makes it easy to tell who's calling before you pick up the handset.

One of the best features is that these phones use standard AAA rechargeable batteries while most of the competition uses their own proprietary batteries that are difficult to find in stores.

Right away I noticed the draft quality of the WF was much worse than the draft of the 8500.  The regular quality looks good, but prints slower than the 8500.  I always thought it was funny HP branded the 8500 an ""Office""Jet and right in the middle of a print out it would stop for literally 5-10 minutes and say ""please wait"" followed by ""cleaning printheads"".  There were times I needed something printed quickly and it would stop and ""please wait"" and I had to print to a different printer to get a truck driver out of our parking lot on time.  Luckily this WF never does that.  When changing ink carts the printhead seems a little flimsy, but no problems yet.  Also I noticed everyone says it's good on ink, and maybe it is compared to how much ink is contained in the carts, but I'm buying far more ink for this WF than the HP 8500.  It's possible the HP carts just have more ink so it seems like it's better on ink, but I'm averaging about $60-80/mo for ink to print about 2 reams of paper a month.  The only other thing I don't like is the document scanning software doesn't let you modify much before saving.  I don't even think it's possible to crop a page before saving to pdf except for ""automatic"" cropping which doesn't seem to work most of the time (many times I scan as letter size and it saves the page legal size, with blank space below the page).

I replaced the 440 printer because the internal connection of the USB connector inside the printer was loose and the connection was intermittent.  It's the same situation with our second 440 printer.  I would conclude that it's a manufacturing defect across the whole platform from this observation.

The newer 650 printer is very fast, but has screeching and loud noise when printing; new Label ""Creator"" software has much better interface, but (here's the rub) the new software does not read label files prepared under prior version software, Label ""Printer.""  There is a way to convert databases, but the Help menu confirms that the old file format for labels cannot be use ""in any way.""

The 650  Printer works fine on old Label ""Printer"" software.  Since all my labels are created on the old software, I have not used the newer software.  Just opened the new program, spent hours trying to figure out why I couldn't find or print my existing labels, in a flash of brilliance, I accessed FAQ on the Help menu, where I confirmed that the label files are not compatible between the older and newer software.

The file incompatibility is the secret information that was not disclosed on the product description.","Printer 4 stars, screeching sound when printing; Software 3 stars because older label files are not compatible with new software",1446854400,,

They are working great for that purpose.  They are the same dimension as a standard file folder (height of the folder = width of a file folder= 11.5""), so they fit inside hanging file folders or can be a part of a stack of papers without sticking out too much (have not used regular folders in awhile but I recall that they are often too tall to stack with other papers or put into a bag).  Keep in mind that the width of this folder (9.75"") does exceed that of a standard file folder, but that has not been an issue for me and gives it greater capacity to hold thicker stacks of papers.

One nice feature of these folders is the arc-shaped cutout in the middle (on the side of each paper pocket) so that is is easy to insert papers into the folder - MUCH easier than standard folders.  I have not had much need for the fold-over tab to keep papers from falling out or the cutouts for the CD or business cards.  The folder functions just fine when the fold-over tab is not used and lies neatly behind papers (tab does not flip up or cause papers to flip out/stick out).

Others have spoken unfavorably about the lightweight cardstock quality of the folder, but I find it to be nice and smooth, similar to a standard file folder.  The smoothness of the paper makes it easy to slide papers in and out of the slots.  The folder likely would not hold up to extreme usage  but meets my needs and expectations.

I like the red color the most since it is pleasant and easy to find in a stack of piles.  The blue is a nice color and the black is classic.

I don't look forward to shopping at Nordstrom or Macys (who employs my husband); however, I LOVE going to office supply stores. I also love it when I'm offered office items via the Vine program.  With this stapler, I have nothing to complain about (except one issue...I'll write about it later).

When I first opened the package I thought, ""Wow, how can this tiny thing be able to staple papers together, especially 40 sheets (as they claim?""  I put some staples in (it won't take a full 'bar' of staples') and started stapling papers.  I kept adding to the pile.  When I reached 40 I thought to myself, ""Here's the real test!""  It passed with ease.  I don't think I even own a stapler (that isn't electric) that can handle that much.  The manufacturer recommends a specific type of staple so my next step is to purchase them and see if there's any difference.

The product is very high quality office grade equipment, not ""consumer"" grade. All buttons have a nice feel.

BASE STATION:
Nice glossy black finish.  Looks high tech and is wall mountable.  It has an LED on the front that changes color to indicate the connection status... green means it is properly connected, orange means trouble.  There is a Page Handsets button on the side that causes all handsets to ring in case you misplace one.  Handset battery life in standby mode is about a week, so you should be able to find it before the battery dies.  The only other feature is the ethernet port.  Just connect the base station to your router, and you're good to go.  The base station has a built in web-based control panel, so you can setup most of the features from your PC. Just get the IP address and enable ""Embedded Web"" access using a handset.  This access turns back off after a short time, which can be a bit annoying.  But it is a security feature, so probably not a bad idea to protect the system.

HANDSETS:
Speakerphone in the cordless handsets is a very welcome feature! The handsets are extremely lightweight and fit your hand and face. The screen is clear and easy to read. The buttons have a nice, crisp feel to them. The charging cradle is wall mountable, so you can stick them anywhere with AC outlet nearby. The batteries last a super long time (like a week) in standby mode, and talk time is great (several hours) due to DECT technology. If you should ever need replacement batteries, you can just buy rechargeable Duracell or Energizer NiMH batteries off the shelf, no weird proprietary batteries to hunt for.

USAGE:
We really like the Intercom feature, which has an ""auto answer"" speakerphone feature. When we ring a coworker's extension, they can respond without touching the handset. You can use this system with a single phone number/account and have it ring one, all or any combination of the base or handsets. You can also use separate accounts for each handset if you need to, since the system supports up to 8, which can be assigned in any combination. In our case, we just have one account that rings our receptionist and office manager. We signed up with a company called voiSip (highly recommended) and saving a TON of money versus our old telco. They helped us connect our voiSip account via a remote support session. They even helped us update the firmware.  Call quality is superior to our old AT&T office phones, and also better than my own Vonage service at home. I purchased a similar Gigaset C610A IP system for my home and switched my home number over to voiSip.

WISH LIST:
The handsets show ""New Voicemail"" and have a small LED blinker, but the Gigaset brand handsets have a much brighter voicemail light. It would be nice if these could do 4 simultaneous calls instead of 3. And we may eventually want more than 6 handsets, so having up to 12 per base would be comforting (but probably not necessary in reality).

WISH LIST UPDATE: Some of our offices are now using this with the voiSip PBX systems, which let you tie together up to 4 base stations and 24 cordless handsets into a single group of extensions, each with its own voicemail box.

Overall, I would highly recommend this for an office with up to 6 people. For a larger office, you should probably consider using these with a PBX system, to get up to 24 handsets.

UPDATE July 2013: Be sure to update the firmware when available. Unlike other brands, Panasonic's menus do not have any means of setting the ""Registration Retry"" duration. This setting defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour). Your router may kick the phone offline before 1 hour, causing inbound calls to fail (outbound calling works fine since it causes a registration event). I don't know about other service providers, but voiSip has a firmware customization they can apply to these phones that sets the registration to 3 minutes. The phones are rock solid once this patch has been applied. (This is only necessary if your phone is connecting to a voip provider or pbx system through a firewall.)

UPDATE Feb 2014: We have several of these now, at various offices around the country. Some of them are connected directly to a voiSip ""Clone Line"" account, and others are being used with a PBX system. Quality and durability has been excellent. We've just had to replace some of the batteries at this point. Luckily, they use standard AAA size rechargeable batteries... look for either Duracell or Energizer NiMH AAA batteries.",Excellent cordless phone system for small business,1391385600,6,

When the pencil promptly arrived I admired the sleek design with the aluminum. The grip is super comfortable and I can write all day at school without my hands getting sore. The grip is really squishy and all of my friends like touching it. Unlike the bigger version of this pencil, it doesn't have the shaker setting to get the lead out.

My only exception is for spa supplies, electronic supplies and computer supplies.  I have had various HP printers over the years and the one thing I don't cut corners on is toner supplies.  I always use Genuine HP toner cartridges no matter what the price is.  Refurbs and compatible toners aren't always reliable and sometimes will void the warranty on your HP product.  The 78A is a great toner and every page comes out clean and perfect.  My only gripe is that there's no high yield cartridge yet and it feels like I'm running low very quickly.

A lot of thought went into making it easy to set up and use, although we managed to defeat some of that in the early going. I really liked the way it presented out of the box with the instruction sheets on top. They are actually easy to follow, so most people will have the physical setup done very quickly. The ink tanks load into their rack very positively: it would be very hard to get it wrong.

Getting wireless connectivity and cloud functions set up requires getting to the settings menu, which requires actually noticing that the front panel display scrolls up and down (circularly), with a press of the up and down buttons. I did not, however, catch on to that until my kid asked if there was more to print because the display said ""1/3.""

LAN and Cloud setup are straightforward after that. The aforementioned instruction sheets have flowcharts so that you are told exactly what to do to set up the device on wireless only, or also have a USB connection to a computer.

It's very satisfying to be able to save something on your phone and send it to Google Cloud Print, or even just share something from an app. Futuristic!

The other caution you must observe when printing letter size pages is to pull out the center tab on the paper catcher; if you don't, it will look like cats got your output. This is, however, pretty normal for this kind of printer.

Canon has a Creative Park website with a number of templates for greeting cards, scrapbook pages, calendars, you name it. Some is premium, but a lot is free, and it's quick to use.

One of my favorite features is two-sided printing,. I do a lot of handouts and mini-reports that just look a ton more professional when printed on both sides. I also experienced a moment of techno-rapture watching it suck the paper back in to print the second side for the first time.

I'm knocking off one star, though, for the fact that the printer is ungraceful about printing (at least from a PC) when it's turned off. I should be able to just go turn it on and have it start printing, but instead I have to click this and poke that. It doesn't always weather Wi-fi glitches well, either, but so far that has only required entering and leaving setup. Still, more time wasted at the keyboard or the control panel that could have been productive.

I'm waiting to see what my ink budget needs to be. It's very nice that ink tank levels are available right on the device, so you won't be caught by surprise. Also, the black tank is the largest, which was clever.

Overall, it's a great device. Glad to have it in my ""SOHO"" environment (aka the desk in the dining room).",Very Nice Home and Small Business Multifunction device,1447632000,2,

The thing is, I really do love these pens.

Way back in the 90's, I used erasable pens constantly for note taking and writing in college/grad school. They were a beast back then (the ink sort of blobbed onto the paper as opposed to flowing, it smudged all over, and the erasing was moderate at best). Even though I'm not in school anymore, I still like to write long-hand, but somehow the *presence* of an eraser makes it easier for me just *write* and not be indecisive about everything I put down on paper.

I heard about these FriXion pens on a web site and I *had* to try them. Flowing LIQUID gel-ink and a true eraser without all the crumbly/smudgy stuff? I needed to try and see if it were true.

It is indeed true. These are true liquid ink pens (not ballpoint) that flows from the barrel smoothly. And it erases SUPER cleanly. The ink is heat-sensitive so it it removed via heat, and not the actual material of the eraser. So the eraser on the pen is more like a tool for making heat (hence the friction) and nothing that is rubbed onto the paper.

The penbs are great, except for a few things:
- the ink is really a dark grey color. It's NOT completely opaque, it's almost translucent grey. If you like that super-inky-black color, this is not a good pen for you.
- every time you use the pen, you have to put a good deal of pressure on it for the ink to flow. So the first few marks you make will be either super light/scratchy or not show up at all.
- You really do need to write with a little bit of pressure to get the ink to keep flowing. So it's not as easy as writing with a regular gel pen.
- the eraser is on the area of the pen you'd cover with the cap when the pen is open, which makes no sense to me.
- the point is a little scratchy and my handwriting looks a little bit ""shaky"" writing with it. It's not as smooth as some other pens I have used, but a general quality of a fine point pen is a tiny bit of scratchiness so it's par for the course, I guess.

finally, and this can be a pro or con-
the ink in these pens are completely heat sensitive. I just hit it with my heat gun for a quick second (used for crating) and the ink disappeared instantly. Pretty cool to watch (it's like in a spy movie!) but if you are doing a project where you need to apply heat in any shape to your materials, the marks from this pen will disappear. I'm excited about the way I can use this in my art projects.

All in all, these are super cool pens, and the best erasable pens I have ever used. I wish they sold a bottle of this ink so I could use it in more applications.",so amazing!,1369440000,3,

Also, the printer won't support 2 sided printing if you have glossy paper, like brochure paper.

The worst part is how expensive and hard it is to purchase the ink. You can only get the ink from epson or stores like staples and officemax, and they all sell each XL cartridge for $43, for my old HP printer (4 years old, never should have replaced it with this) I could replace all 4 XL cartridges for $120, this printer is costing me $220, and it only prints about about 2500 pages vs. 2100 on the HP.

I was very interested in the DIY Jewel Stickers as well as the Assorted Skins from Swingline.  So I got this one for me and the other for my husband.  Neither of the Swinglines came with staples but luckily I had a box on hand.  It's a basic black and purple stapler that is very light weight.  I have yet to get it to staple through 20 sheets without jamming.  10 is no problem.  My biggest complaint is the jewels.  They are laid down on the plastic sheet with glue touching the next one.  So, you try taking off one but several come up stuck to each other.  I also had a hard time keeping the sticky on the jewel; it often came off the back and stuck to the plastic sheet.  Needless to say I could not recreate the cute designs that are of the model picture.  Mine still turned out cute and my girls often comment on how nice my stapler is.  I think you could do better buying a heavier duty stapler and just buying a nice set of stick on rhinestones at another store to make a better end product.

The sticky strip is great ... once it's sealed, it's not going to come unglued! But I've had a few bags tear just from when I was removing the strip from the adhesive. The bags are pretty  thin! Though I would trust them with a light weight item for domestic shipping, I would not trust them if I had a heavy item to ship, nor would I use them for my international shipping. I don't know if they would withstand the wear very well.

We have purchased these bags a few times since our original review. They're okay, the quality seems to vary. I think it depends on the seller and where they are purchasing their bags.

All work very well, but my recent time spent with an Invicta makes me appreciate the small improvements that Razer has made over the years.

The brilliant idea behind the eXactMat is that it's two-sided:  one side has a smooth and very cleanly-painted black surface for ""Speed"" and another is a textured flat black for ""Precision"".  It's true that your goals in gaming do play out a bit differently depending on which surface you use, but gaming mice these days are so precise (and let you switch responsiveness on the fly) that which side of the mat you use is more of a 'fine-tuning' touch.  Still, it's a very nice touch:  the eXactMat is rigid metal, solid construction, and the surface is huge and paint thick.

There are drawbacks though, which I see have been improved in the Invicta (which I'll review elsewhere):
- the surfaces scratch easily, so you want the mat sitting on something soft:  my desk had a metal edge and I had to cover it because it was regularly pushing back the mouse mat and scraping the edges.
- each side has rubber feet at the corners to help prevent whichever side is down from getting scratched up:  these feet are stickers that started coming off and got harder to keep stuck on over time.
- it's really not very ""portable"":  put this on your desk but don't expect it to be easy to stow in a laptop bag (for that, I highly recommend the roll-up Razer Kabuto!)

Other than that, just be aware that your hand will naturally give off oils and skin cells that can gunk the surface up.  While it's easy to clean, you need to use a mild cleaner and wipe gently so as not to mar the paint.  I recently found that Nivea Men 3-in-1 Active Body Wash did a great job of cleaning the thing to be like new again.

Other reviewers will tell you that some mice can behave a bit flaky with it.  I love gaming in low-light conditions and I recently realized that my Tron Mouse acted up sometimes if I didn't have more light in the room.  That said, I've had to spend more time with a Copperhead and an Ouroboros lately and they appear to work well, as does my Tact-X.  You wouldn't think the mouse would make a difference, but maybe it does.

The wrist rest is a really nice extra:  it's shaped perfectly to fit underneath the mouse mat (and also help prevent scuffing).  I tend to relax my hands more when I'm playing a game like Fallout 3 or Skyrim, so it makes me more comfortable over long gaming sessions.

If you'd like a unique mouse mat for gaming, the eXactMat and its wrist rest is a really good idea.  It's just that newer iterations of this idea from Razer have improved the whole concept a bit better.","Still a Great Product, Newer Versions a Bit Better",1413936000,,

The current 25% off coupon which is available here on Amazon was an unexpected bonus, but I would have purchased this stapler even without a discount.

The first of these staplers in black that I bought at a local Office Depot about 5 years ago is still going strong and I for the life of me cannot recall it ever having jammed once during regular daily use.

The same cannot be said for the other big stapler brand, Swingline. I have owned several such staplers in the past and they definitely would jam with some regularity during use. Swingline staplers are also not as durable or well designed as the PaperPro line: sooner or later (after a few years) they would inevitably reach a point of being ""all swung out"" and it would be time to purchase a new stapler.

This PaperPro Prodigy stapler not only uses standard office staples which are readily available, but also easily staples up to 25 sheets of paper with one-hand/one-finger convenience. Adding new staples is a simple task when the stapler is turned upside down and the staple tray essentially slides open on its own. It also can be used as a bulletin board stapler if the need arises.

The PaperPro Prodigy stapler is clearly the best functioning, most durable and reliable mechanical stapler that I have ever owned and I recommend it highly without reservations.

This Printer was a big disappointment. For the price I expected much more. The printer does not have a rear paper feed slot, big drawback. I was willing to live with this. But when I loaded a 6 3/4 size envelope and the printer did not have that paper size available, that's when I started to get frustrated. A plus to the printer is the hp support. It was difficult for me to locate the option for chat support on hp's website, but unfortunately I got very good at locating and using this. While the chat support was phenomenal (actually helped me figure out my scanning issue that made me get rid of the Epson WF-7620!) they could not help me with the envelope issue. the solution was to install a strange driver that then made it necessary to enter the paper size on my computer printer settings each time I changed paper size. not acceptable. Then I had unfixable issues with printing photo's from my computer without the printer adding a border. From AirPrint, photo's had no border, but I could not print a borderless photo from my PC, even after hours with chat support and weird drivers being installed that compromised other functions of the printer. They did get photo's to print without border from my PC with one driver, but then half of the photo was discolored, consistently.

Pro's:
+ hp's chat support
+ nice quality photo's and documents
+ double paper tray

Con's
- no size 6 3/4 envelope paper option (but there is a Japanese postcard size??)
- no rear paper feed slot
- tray for printed items is awkward
- white color

In the end, after much back and forth, hp issued me a full refund. (I was out the tax, and price of ink, however).

This might be a good printer for someone, I'm happy that at least through all of this, hp support helped me figure out that my printer/scanner needs to be within 15 feet of my Wi-Fi router in order to scan.

The idea of one that had a built-in foot warmer was too good to resist since I'd never seen one like this, so I was eager to try this out.

This heats up in just about a minute, and the heat radiates from both beneath and above the footrest, so you can feel it when your feet are resting on the top surface or if you place them below.  Unlike other reviewers, I found that the heat seems pretty evenly distributed throughout the platform, both in the center and side areas.

The reason for my four-star review (instead of five stars) is that the footrest itself seems pretty flimsy.  It doesn't easily slide to move it, and tends to get stuck.  Other footrests I have glide smoothly when you need to adjust/move them with your feet, but this one doesn't.

It would also be nice if the heat levels were adjustable on this.  I've found that it gets a bit too warm at times, but, for the price, I'm happy with the level of heat it puts out.

The Aurora is a very loud shredder and it gets a lot louder if it has been running for awhile.  The Aurora makes it sound like I have a lawn mower going in my office which is really effective when I am trying to scare away little children but not much good the rest of the time.

The Swingline shredder does have its issues though, most importantly the catcher basket.  The Aurora top lifts off the basket, so when it stops taking in paper, I just lift off the shredder part and turn it upside down so it only spills a few pieces of paper on its way upside down.  But this Swingline shredder has a pull out basket, and since I keep it on the floor, I don't notice on the front peek window when it is nearing full.  Then it involves serious muscle to get it back out.  And it makes a huge mess.  I have found that it makes a mess well before it gets to the full line anyway.

Overall, this is a much better shredder and my Aurora has ended up in my husband's office, even though he says he doesn't need one.  He does.  He just doesn't know it yet.","Quiet AND Efficient and, UPDATE: DEAD",1405641600,13,

I find they typically have good features, good quality and a nice price.  I was offered the opportunity to review this phone and, frankly,  this is a most impressive phone system.

1.  What is in the box?  You receive, in a surprisingly small box, two headsets, with separated batteries and back covers, along with a answering machine base for one headset and a second small base with a charger unit attached (you, of course, also receive the two phone lines.  Also included is a decent (but not comprehensive) list of instructions.

2. Set-up: Easy.  Frankly, very easy.  Without looking at the instructions, I simply placed the batteries in the headsets, and the phone had some power and was ready to go.  After placing the phone in the cradle, and placing the wires for power and the phone-line, I was ready to go.  Phone: I was immediately able to use the phone immediately.

3. Features: The most impressive aspect of this phone is the Bluetooth connect feature.  I cannot state how awesome a tool this is.  Using the Bluetooth feature on my cellphone, I simply uploaded the PIN and this phone and my cellphone connected.  I was able to actually upload my phone book from my cell to this headset as well.  By selecting either the phone button or cell button I can use either to dial or answer either phone using just this headset.  Wow.
The other cool feature is that you can set-up two cell phones for interaction with this system and assign distinctive ring-tones.  Thus, you can answer this phone or two cell-phones no matter where you are in the house (it gives a 33 foot range, but in practice I have achieved 40-50 feet in many areas of my home without an issue).
I love this feature.  I have no idea if it is proprietary to Uniden, but it is easy to set-up and use and makes things very easy.

4. Aesthetic: The headsets are silver in color, with the inner phone parts being black.  The buttons are lit during use and are fairly large and easy to see.  The buttons signifying Home and Cell are green and purple, respectively, and are easily found.  The Home base with answering machine is also silver with black features.  It is not the most stylish phone system I have seen, but it is nice looking and certainly not something to be embarrassed about in the slightest.

Positives:
1.  There are a number of positives with this phone.  First, the phone is nice looking and easy to hold.  The buttons are easily read and to use.  The display is a nice feature as well with caller ID showing and possible messages displayed along with date and time.
The Bluetooth connection makes this phone a winner.  Love this feature (see above).  The phone also has a speaker on each headset (can use this as an intercom).  Another interesting thing is that the phone has the correct date and time displayed without my entering it because I think it uploaded the information from my cellphone.  Cool.

2. Neutral:  Nothing stands out in my mind after use as being mediocre.
3. Negatives:  Not many negatives at all with this phone. In fact, I have none. The only quibble is I think the ""End"" button is too small and poorly placed, resulting in some thought about where my fat finger has to go to terminate the call.  I think this irritation will go away with more use, but it is the only (little) negative I have about this phone.

Conclusions:

In short, I am very impressed with this phone system.  In my mind, the over the top feature is the Bluetooth connection, which really expands the range and use of this phone (and justifies the landline, which becomes an afterthought in my household because of the use of a cellphone). The price currently on Amazon is around 50 to 60ish and this is an excellent price point for the features available.  I wouldn't hesitate with purchasing this item.
I reserve judgment for battery life and use, but for the few days I have had it, the system seems to conserve battery power off the chargers quite well.  A winning system that is worth an upgrade for the Bluetooth features alone.  A winner.  I am very happy with this item, and I think a potential buyer would be as well.",Impressive features.

A person who does do a large amount of printer could save money by buying a lower model.  One advantage of the 845 is the ability to hold 500 sheets of paper between the two trays.  Within the printer settings of your computer you are able to set it up, so automatically prints to the seconds when the first tray is out of paper. The printer does have automatic duplex printing, which help reduce paper waste.  The text on the prints are clear and colors are bright.

The network setup was easy and does not require you to hook it up to computer to make a connection to a WiFi network.  Just power on the printer, go the network settings, locate your WiFi network and type in the key to connect.

The scanning also does not require a computer you can scan direct to a SD card.  The scanning is about average from what I experienced with other scanners.

I do not do any photo printing because I prefer to use my Canon Selphy for quick prints, so I cannot comment on the quality of the prints on the 845.  From past experiences, photos have been below average with all in one printer in the lower budget range.

Ink usage is typical for an inkjet printer, with Magenta being used the most of the three colors.  The cost is a little high using genuine Epson ink.  However; I have saved money by having them refilled.  Costco is going to start refilling Epson cartridges now.

It uses up ink fast.  Totally useless for large projects.  I was trying to create an obituary for a friend, by the time I was thru I had used up 3 sets of ink cartridges (at approx $20/cartridge), & ended up having to go to Office Depot to get them printed anyway.

The feeder doesn't work well.  If you're trying to feed more than 2 or 3 items at a time, it stops working.  Especially if the items being fed thru are not 8"" X 11"".  Anything smaller or larger will jam the machine.

The scanner is a pain.  Even though it says it will scan stuff that is fed thru the feeder, I've only been able to scan items placed on the platten.  You have to tell the machine what it's scanning too.  I mean if the document being scanned is a black/white document, black/white picture, color document or color picture.  If you don't the quality of the scan is effected.  My previous scanners have scanned what's seen.  I didn't have to fiddle with the machine prior to making each scan.  Small items being scanned come out ok.  But because of the feeder problem, if you need to scan something that's larger than 8"" X 11"", forget about it.

Based on my experience with this product, I will never buy another Cannon printer.",Do not buy this machine,1293840000,,

235110,2,True,"08 7, 2008",A1RJ5DGMIXQFN1,B0013N5X28,,A Reader,"First off, let me say I am flatbed scanner impaired. I simply cannot seem to scan a bed of photo's without getting fingerprints, dust and pet hair on the bed. I spend more time cleaning the bed then scanning. Then, after I finally get a decent scan free of those things, spending more time separating and rotating the images drives me nuts. I looked at scanning old photo's as a chore that I hated. So, when I saw this, I was as excited as a kid on Christmas eve, this was the answer to my prayers!

It was short lived. First impressions- it is made of plastic and weighs about 1/2 lb, if that. It's so lightweight I'm afraid that if my cat crawled on it it would crack. I had no problem installing the driver, but chose not to install the Photoimpression 6 software it comes with as I have many others that are better. If it's connected to the computer, it's on. If you don't want it on, you have to unplug it from the computer. There's no on/off button.

The first problem came when I tried to scan an old photo from the 1970's. I have boxes of photo's from this era taken with camera's of that era--Polaroids, Brownies and Instamatics. None of these work with this scanner. The photo must slide into one of the frames (it comes with three frames of set sizes). So when I put a square photo from an old Instamatic camera into a rectangular frame, it fell out inside the scanner. Luckily, the scanner is so light I held it upside down and it fell out. I'm sure I can make some sort of frame for the frame to hold these other sized photos, but we're back to a hassle of then having to crop that out as it only scans the set sizes of the set frames.

The next issue for me came when I then went and found a correct sized photo for the frame. The frame is hard plastic. There is a slot on the top and you slide the photo through the slot and down into the frame. And when I did so, all the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I imagined how many scratches and nicks this was causing to a 25 year old photo. I spend hours correcting image flaws just from storage in old magnetic albums and boxes, the thought of adding more damage to them trying to get them in and out of a frame was not thrilling.

I have many graphic programs that will import scanned images so I did not install the Photoimpression 6 software that was included. But when I tried importing in PSP, PS, Vue Scan, and even with the basic Scanner wizard in XP, I got not only the image, but the frame that held it as well. The screen shots in the users manual didn't have the frame showing so I then went back and installed PhotoImpression. For some reason I don't get, using this software does remove the frame from the finished image. But it sure would be easier to have it import into the program I use to fix and scrap with.

Bottom line is that all those photo's taken for decades prior to my first 35mm camera, will still have to be scanned on a basic flatbed. And those from the eras which are finally of the right size, I'm not scratching trying to get them in and out of the frame. I'm sending it back.",limited and possibly dangerous to old photo's,1218067200,119,

Both pens write very smoothly and use a new type of liquid ink.  The ink is not a gel and it flows beautifully.  Gel pens sometimes exhibit skips or blobs of ink that detract from the wonderful saturated pigment that makes gel better than traditional ballpoint pen ink.  The liquid ink in the Vision Elite flows just like fountain pen ink, with no skips or blobs.  Although it is thinner and more liquid than gel ink it shows much less feathering than some fountain pen inks.

Overall, the Vision Elite with a broad point is my new favorite pen.  I'm sure people who prefer fine or medium points would also like this pen.

I no longer use a regular color printer, Lazer is the only way to go unless you need color prints.
This does it all....Color scanning, copies and print from computer.
I had a regular Canon Lazer printer and it still works fine but I needed to replace my Brother Lazer printer, scanner, copier because it kept saying:
REPLACE THE CARTRIDGE even after I replaced it with a new one.
As a result I no longer could make copies or prints from the computer, it would only scan.
So I was using my Canon Lazer printer and used the Brother for scanning only.
I'm so glad to get rid of the Brother and give it the Salvation Army.
Maybe someone else will have better luck.
This was my second Brother Lazer printer and both had the same issues even though the cartridges were interchangeble.
Anyway, back to the Canon.
It was amazon deal under $70.00 and it's perhaps the best deal.
I must mention that after you turn on the power it goes in to standby mode only after 30 or 40 seconds.
Nothing will function, printing or scanning, until it comes out of standby mode.
I'm going to look at the manual to see if I can change it.
In the meantime, I don't turn on the power until I'm ready to print, copy or scan.
You must select on the Canon if you want to scan before attempting to scan.
It's real easy....You select scan and then show the computer as the destination.
Then you can proceed to make a scan.
The drivers installed easily on both of my Windows 7 computers.

Configured printer for quiet mode and noise was all but eliminated  very nice.  Once the WiFi was configured, all my mobile and tablet devices automatically discovered the printer without further configuration; it does take several minutes though before it prints, but again its wireless so Im sure there is some acceptable level of delays expected.  The WSD (Web Services on Devices) option is great, as it allows you to send a wireless scan directly back to your computer (running Windows 7) from the printer itself.  Print images are laser like in quality and speed.  Printed several color 8x10 images and the pictures quality on photo paper was great, while it was above average on standard printer paper.  Scanning, using the scanner software on the computer or from the printer directly, was superfast and scanned documents were crystal clear at 300dpi as pdf copies.  Have not tried the fax from it yet, because I use Windows Fax and Scan utility, but once the WSD is setup the printer can send scans directly to Windows Fax and Scan application so you quickly make quick work of attaching it to a fax.

The responsive touchscreen LCD makes setup 100X easier than the previous generation.

CONS:  WiFi setup took three attempts and some light troubleshooting before I was able to connect to the network.  Needed to Google search the instructions on how to setup WSD as I didn't find any helpful information on the CD that came with the printer.  Also had to go to the support website to download the new scanner drivers/software because the file on the CD failed to work on both my Windows 7 machines.  Fairly large in size, but thats to be expected from a SOHO all-in-one printer.  Printer cartilages that came with the printer were less than half filled, so it greatly reduces your ability to fully use the printer before stopping to go buy more ink.  Online pricing for ink ranges from $35-45 each for the four 786 cartilages: Black, Cyan, Magenta, & Yellow  Ouch!! The printer only suppoerts B/G/N WIFI, not 5K Dual Band.  This was problematic because my notebook could not see the printer on 5K Wireless-N.  There could be a router configuration to fax that though but I haven't found it.

I found myself relying on the images from the box rather than trying to figure out what the diagrams were telling me to do. You also definitely do not need a hammer to assemble this and it seems unnecessarily confusing to include this in the instructions.

Bending the ""metal side rails"" to adjust the length of the frame needs to be done with great care. The metal is very sturdy and difficult to ""bend back and forth until the rail breaks."" The end result for me was a slightly curved rail that I needed to bend back into position but it never became completely straight again. I feel this is a flaw in the design of the product as following their instructions damaged the professional look of the product.

Finally, the height of the stand is slightly too short so the bottom of the folders touch the my cabinet. They drag when opening and closing the folders.

This is my second TWSBI. I also bought the white ECO with the 1.1 stub nib, which I adore. I enjoy it ALMOST as much, but it is most definitely still worth the 5 star rating, though I did have a few hiccups with it at first. When I received it, I promptly filled it with Private Reserve Black Cherry, a fun dark red purple. I began writing to test and plop! A big drop of ink landed a few lines above. I thought maybe it was a fluke, wiped it up and went on, but the next two times I used the pen, it did the same thing. So I searched online to find out what might be the issue. I had cleaned the nib after filling, so that wasn't it. I already had another TWSBI, so I was reluctant to immediately think it was a problem requiring return and continued scouring the forums. It turns out it was a ridiculously easy fix: push the nib in just a little bit. I did and the problem appears to be resolved quickly and easily without return to the manufacturer.
Pros:
Large ink capacity
Ease of use
Sturdy material
Sharp-looking pen
I love the demonstrator pens

Problem with these inks is that one color cartridge leaked inside it's plastic package. Good thing they come in divi ally wrapped. I figured it maybe an isolated defective item. Amazon refunded for the prorated cost on it. I was happy with it until I noticed another ink cartridge that leaked in its wrapped package. I did not bother calling in to amazon for that one. There seems to be an issue with little cap that holds ink from coming out. I have OEM inks which I carried around with me in my bag for months with no issue. Now, I am beginning to wonder and worry that these may leak out while it is inserted in the printer since I do not know if the hole that contacts with printer head is the issue or the orange cap that is the issue.

The Visioneer scanners were were okay, but slow and clunky.  Then I switched to Mac, and could no longer use Visioneer products.  I have been using an HP all-in-one for a while now, but it's just not designed for efficient scanning.  After a long search at Apple stores, Fry's, etc., I came across the ScanSnap on Amazon.  I must say, this is EXACTLY what I have been looking for over the past several months.  It scans both sides in one pass, and is very fast on AC power.  It sends your file straight to PDF (or jpeg) with no quirky complications.  There are plenty of options after the scan if you choose to use them (send image to email, iPhoto, printer, and others), but I typically let the image go straight to a PDF file and catalogue them in Bento 2.  The 300M will also operate on USB power, which I plan on using soon.  Do note, however, that this is NOT a TWAIN scanner.  You must rely on the Fujitsu drivers. Fortunately, the software is robust enough where this has not been a problem.  In fact, some software like ReceiptWallet/DocumentWallet will let you scan straight into their program.

The length is perfect to fit into a pocket, while still being full length with the cap off.  Being made almost entirely of metal it has a very satisfying weight in the hands.  With no clip this pen has no sharp edges to damage the other contents of my pockets, which is nice, but it rolls off tables readily.  I am neutral on the appearance of this pen; while it is clearly well made, most people I hand it too don't know right away how to use it and several people have commented that it looks a bit like a suppository.

While this pen always writes immediately, every once in a while it will leak a small glob of ink onto the page just when I start writing with it.  As for writing quality, I have a Zebra F-701 which writes a very clean and fine line which I prefer to the space pen.

For pocket use this pen is king and I highly recommend it.

I tried to troubleshoot it myself by buying a new ink cartridge, updating the software downloads and cleaning the ink heads and the printheads. Nothing worked. I called Dell and they refused to stand by their product since it was outside the warranty period by about 30 days. I understand warranty periods and I understand policies. But Dell no longer allows their employees the ability to consider a situation on a case by case basis to allow their employees the ability to weigh the reasonableness. While I didn't make the call to them during the warranty period while I troubleshooted the situation myself, I did not think that it would result in potential charges that could run at levels that could pay for a new printer ($29.95 for diagnostics and $129 for a new printhead plus taxes and S&H).  I am very disappointed in Dell and I am very disappointed in this printer.  I had used Hewlett Packard Printers and never had any issues until many years of use (4+). This printer seemed flimsy from the start in comparison to the HP's I've had so I have been very ginger in handling it. I bought it because Consumer Reports recommended it. I'm surprised that the printhead would fail so soon and more surprised at the lack of consideration of the short time frame.

Setup takes  bit of time & definitely needed a cable to complete.  Wireless functions may take a little longer than expected to initiate.

Printing is very fast and is of a very high quality.  It does not seem to have any issues with paper feed.

Oh, how I wish I had read reviews before I purchased this printer.

The installation began with not being able to connect to my wireless network.  This wouldn't have been a deal-breaker entirely, because though we had wanted a wireless printer it wasn't essential.  However, the cable given to connect the printer to the computer was extremely short (about two feet long) and as such, made it impossible to connect from any position on the desk.

The installation attempt ended with the paper jamming on every attempt.  My husband, a copier repairman, spent an hour trying to find the reason, but to no avail.  Every piece of paper (20 weight office-quality copier paper) that was fed through it jammed trying to feed through.

At this point, I have boxed it back up and am returning it.  I will never buy a HP product again.",Piece of Crap,1376956800,3,

First, I made the bold statement in my initial review that this printer was more of an ""ink hog"" than my Canon MX870.  Now that I have more track time with the XP-810, I don't feel that was a fair statement.  In fact, the printer appears to be quite conservative in its ink usage.  I've never known with any certainty if printer manufacturers' supply you with full ink cartridges when you first buy a printer because I've heard it both ways.  The other comment I made about having to stand by the printer and load the paper and push the print button manually on the LCD panel to do a rear feed is still somewhat of a nuisance but not to the degree I first commented.  In summary, I find this to be an excellent printer as I think can be told by the way it is holding its price since its release.

It needed to be small so I could clip it to a lanyard and it needed to be able to write on many different surfaces, in any temperature.

Anyway - I bought the pen and I'm glad I did!  It stays tightly attached to my lanyard (unlike those mini sharpies with clips on their caps - I've lost too many of those in the woods!) So far, it's written on every geocaching log I've encountered - even the damp ones.  A+++ pen.  Recommend to all.

 If you are unfamiliar, geocaching is a hobby where people hide containers in public places - woods, nature trails, parking lots, bus stations, libraries...just about anywhere - and post the coordinates (longitude and latitute) on the geocaching dot com website.  Other geocachers use these coordinates to locate the hidden container and sign the log book.  Through this hobby, I've visited some amazing locations!  It's not so much about the hidden container as it is the hike and area  where it's hidden!

* Shake, shake, and shake the ink bottle every single time as the flecks will settle on the bottom of the bottle. If you're not sure it needs to be shaken, then shake it.
* I would only use this ink in a pen whose nib is (and stays) fairly wet. I can imagine that this ink could gum up a nib and feed if it were to dry out.

770300,5,True,"09 10, 2014",ARBKYIVNYWK3C,B004WOPKIW,,THATCHMAN1,"I love the ScanSnap line and have had several models. I have adopted this product line at my workplace for personal scanners, and we have never had a failure. They're fast, reliable, durable and this model is no different. I've also owned the model slightly larger than this, the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300 Instant PDF Sheet-Fed Mobile Scanner (PA03603-B005). I would definitely choose this model for the mobile traveling worker.

This is the first ultra mobile Scansnap, and I cannot convey how impressed I am with it! The device is literally about the size of two snickers bars put end to end. It's tiny, feels well constructed, and does not require external power. The software installation is quick is easy. It does not come with Adobe Acrobat Full version, like some of the older models used to include. It does not scan double sided as do many of the other Scansnap devices. If you've used a scansnap this one puts the brakes on and reverses you-- the paper actually feeds in the front and out the back-- Opposite of all Scansnaps. It works just fine once you realize what's going on there.

Those couple of drawbacks considered, if you are a mobile road warrior who needs to scan on the go, (signed paperwork, business cards, receipts, etc.) this is clearly my most preferred choice for a mobile scanner. The quality of scans is completely satisfactory, and honestly this little device does much better with tiny thin pieces of paper like receipts as compared to some of the larger models-- that are designed for a whole stack of paper-- and from time to time will skew a thin tiny receipt sideways and crinkle it up.

My thoughts on this model vs. the S1300: If you travel and set up at a hotel, temporary office or trade table type environment for a few days or all day, or need double sided scanning, the S1300 is a fine option. It's larger and takes more space if you're flying. If you travel or fly daily, or move from client to client during the day and want the smallest lightest option, this would be my recommended option. It would be perfect for sales forces, insurance company members, consultants, and others who go from place to place quickly, want minimal bulk, and the ability to scan a few documents quickly & easily. If you need to scan small stacks of paper, go with the S1300.

As I continue to have the scanner longer I will plan to update the review. But at this point, the install was easy, the scan quality is good and use is easy, and the device is unbelievably small yet feels ""not flimsy"" and I couldn't be any more pleased with it's functionality and portability. If you have any specific questions or would like a certain additional feature tested, please leave a comment below and I will answer you ASAP.

Update: I have added a photo of it in my hand for size comparison. It's unbelievably trim!

Update: I've completed my first business trip with 13 pages of various sized receipts, full page receipts, baggage fee wide receipts, etc. I was able to scan them all in about 2 minutes. As well, a couple features I didn't mention explicitly above: The scanner auto aligns the images-- you don't have to worry about feeding them through exactly straight. Finally, the software ""sits and waits"" between receipts you feed through, until you click ""finished"". This is a FAR superior software feature to the larger S1300-- because it takes a few moments to put down & pick up another receipt. The scanner sits patiently and waits for you to feed through as many receipts or pieces of paper as you want, with no urgency.

The scanning went perfectly and I'll post a few examples of the scans with no personal info on them as an example of scan quality. Since I've had the scanner I carry it with me in my backpack every day to & from work and everywhere I travel with my work backpack. Still going strong with no issues.

Update: I recently needed to scan some very plastic like paper and it didn't want to curl upwards to come out of the scanner. I then learned that the back ""door"" on the scanner can very easily be removed so the paper feeds straight through without bending it. Another question, and another problem solved easily.

Update: I discovered that the rear door can easily be removed so you can scan hard cards like plastic credit cards, membership cards, etc. right through the unit without bending them at all! Also great for older style hard photos as long as they're not too thick.

UPDATE: I had bought this originally Feb 10, 2011 and recently lost it in luggage. I bought another and it seems the product listing had changed, so I shared my review here again because I love it so much. Everything about my review still stands","Tiny, amazing mobile scanner!",1410307200,7,

By professionals, captains of industry, artists, and school children.  My Japanese teacher turned me onto them, great for precision writing of Kanji.  I think the Japanese affinity for them stems from the similarity to sumi-e (charcoal) writing implements traditionally used to write Kanji characters.

I don't recall these Kuru Toga pencils from when I was there, I might have been using them all along and didn't realize what I had.  Anyway, I just bought this one from Amazon and fell in love with it instantly.  For a piece of consumer goods that costs less than $6.00 the engineering and design of this thing is a marvel.  Might sound funny but it is beautiful to look at.  Smoke translucent high gloss plastic barrel, neon green grip and eraser cap, chome-look tip, ridges molded into the end to make it easier to grip.
The auto rotation/ auto advance of the lead works perfectly as expected.  To test it I started writing and could not stop.  The included HB leads are for me, the perfect balance of darkness and hardness.  Silky smooth on the paper and they produce no dust that will smudge.  I spent the day today at work, writing with a 0.5 mech pencil (not one of these, just a standard one) and the lead broke every 10 seconds literally.  Snap, click to advance.  Snap, click to advance. Snap, click to advance.  Frustration.  Got home, opened this up and just wrote a lot and have not broken the point once.

Includes a starter pack of HB 0.7 leads and 3 erasers (one installed and two spares).  The pencil itself had about 3 leads pre-installed so get this ""starter set"" and you'll be good to go for a long time.  Amazon sells a 40- pack of the 0.7 leads as an ""add-on"" item for a couple of dollars if you spend more than $25.

Up until about 5 months ago, I used an Epson Workforce 600 printer as my everyday printer... for documents, and everyday photo printing.  For documents, it was an excellent printer.  It was also ""good"" for printing photos.  However for my important gallery photos, I use my Epson Stylus Pro 3880... a professional photo printer.  The problem with the Workforce 600 is that it used Durabrite ink, which is a pigment based ink. In the past, all pigment based ink had a problem with glossy paper called metamerism.  That's a property where the ink sits on TOP of the paper surface. The results were that when viewed under different lighting conditions the color appears to shift a little bit, and even caused ""bronzing"", especially in the blacks when viewed under spectral lighting. This effect was most noticable in black and white prints.  Also, when viewed at certain angles the images would appear less glossy and uneven when going from lighter colors, or clear, to dark colors... almost like a negative image!

My latest SMALL printer is the Epson Artisan 810 printer, which uses Claria ink... a dye based ink. No more bronzing or metamerism!  The glossy prints have an even gloss and truly look like regular photo prints from your local pro camera store!... some small drug store labs still give you prints with uneven gloss... or semi-gloss. Also, Claria ink adds two more colors, Light Magenta and Light Cyan which means that you get a potentially wider color gamut (depending on your color settings) than you do with the old Durabrite 4-color ink system.
The problems with pigment based inks have been pretty much eliminated, due to micro encapsulation of the ink droplets in the best pigment based inks. The encapsulation surrounds each droplet with a polymer, which almost completely eliminates their previous problems.  I am extremely happy with this color pack not just because it saves money over buying the cartridges individually, but also because it uses Claria ink!",Ahhhh!  Much better than Dura Brite inks!!,1311897600,88,

I narrowed it down to two models, and picked this one because of the large display and buttons, which are easier to see when the power is out.  This phone is great, because the basic functions work when the power is out, but if you're interested in the bells and whistles, those work only when there is additional power.  And at the time I bought it, it cost very little.

Note, although this phone has a large base, it is very light, as though there is really not much in the base, which is there only to provide a space to present the large buttons.

Note, many of our neighbors have accepted fiber optics from the phone company, which means that they don't have line power to make their phones work when the power goes out (the fiber optic installation has a battery, but from what I've heard it doesn't last that long).  I simply cannot be out of touch that long (old sick family members) so we have refused the fiber optic ""upgrade"", and are very happy when the power goes out that this phone keeps working.",Modern phone which works when power goes out,1443830400,,

You won't get commercial quality laser printing, but it's easily good enough for 99.9% of office use. The only thing I've ever noticed as a con to the type of toner these brother printers and lower end laser printers use, is that the toner doesn't stick to the page forever, especially when rubbed against.

What I mean is that if you were to put a printed document that came off a laser printer like this in your pocket, you might notice that some of the toner abrades off over time. Especially when folded.

That being said, MOST people will never even notice that. I only noticed it due to some extreme circumstances that I was using it for originally (documents that went into people's wallets didn't fair well!).

For invoices, documents, etc that you would use in a typical office environment it's great.

HOWEVER, the ONLY thing I can tell you is:

LASER PRINTERS REQUIRE A LOT OF POWER. A ton of power. When they turn on anyway. So here's the problem...

Most houses are wired with 15amp circuits. This printer when it turns on pulls ~ 10 amps which will cause the power to flicker a bit (brown out). If you had something with a reasonably high load on the same circuit, it would probably blow the breaker. If your house has GOOD wiring (not cheap contractor grade wiring), you might not experience this brown out/flicker. However, you most likely will. No problem if you can deal with it, but something to beware of if you have a lot of electronics on the same circuit. For example, a computer on the same circuit might reboot due to the brown out. My understanding that this has not so much to do with the breaker but with the wiring that runs from the box and also from the road.

IDEALLY you put this on a circuit that's 20amps and wired for that kind of load. In that case, you'll be just fine.

I've also seen it do just fine on certain 15amp circuits, so it does depend a lot on the wiring in your house/office.

For me, it's tolerable for now, I just had to put the computer on a UPS to protect it from the drops in voltage that occur when the toner heats up right before a print.

Unfortunately, after plugging this phone into my line (Verizon phone service with DSL, DSL filter on the line), about 80% of the time the phone would not get a dial tone.  Eventually I determined that somehow the the 8865 was dialing a ""1"" all by itself (an 800 number without a preceding ""1"" went through OK, a local number would get error ""do not dial a 1 for this number"").  Dialing with the handset or base resulted in the same behavior.

Thinking this was a bad unit, I tried a 2nd unit (same model), this one did the same thing.  @$#^%@$#!  So there is either a design flaw with this model or there's a bad batch of 8885's floating around.  Uniden CS was polite but unhelpful, so both phones had to be returned.

However, in normal use, I find that the Fine Tip stays Fine for a very very long time -- and the thickness of the stroke can be varied a bit, from Fine to heavy, just by the way the pen is held when using it.

I like this pen because of the crisp black decisive lines it makes -- use it and your message definitely gets seen and/or noticed. I mark my laundry with this too and it seems to hold thru many washes quite well.

The ink lasts a long time, especially if the pen is stored top down -- however, when clipped to a shirt pocket, you might need to add a second cap to the BOTTOM of the pen once the ink starts to get fainter (get the cap from an old Sharpie that you are about to place in the recycle bin) so the pen (now with two caps, one on the bottom, one on the top)can hang upside down in your shirt pocket (this will allow the ink that is at the bottom of the wick, to wick its way back to the top of the pen - and your pen will retain its writing ability much longer).

You must, of course, make sure the photos are clean and the feeder will get tripped up if the photos are bent at all, but this is pretty par for the course as far as feeders go.  The feeder works pretty well.

What has gone way beyond my expectations are some cool features on the flatbead scanner.  First of all, you can set the scanner for an auto mode and it will automatically detect the kind of document you are scanning and set the save settings accordingly.  You can also set these manually, but I have found that unnecessary and love having the ability to scan in random documents (photo, to text, black and white, color) one after the other without messing with anything.

ALSO - this is the coolest - I placed multiple photos on the flatbead scanner and let it go on its auto settings and it AUTOMATICALLY saved each photo as a separate document and cropped the saved images perfectly.  I can't tell you how much time this saves me.  No more cropping and saving and resizing.

Printing only 45 pages used approximately 3/4 of the black ink.  I don't know if the ink that comes in the box with the printer contains less than what you would get if you bought the ink separately so I can't say if store purchased ink would last longer.  Other than that, I love this all-in-one printer.  It easily connected wirelessly to my router so the only cables I have to deal with are phone (for faxing) and power.  Be aware that though you can use a USB cable to connect this to your computer if you want, the only cable provided in the box is for power.  Compared to my Cannon printer (printing and scanning only, no fax, not wireless) this Epson takes first place.  It is really fast at printing.  I hadn't realized the technology had advanced this far.  It seems like it's almost on par with a laser printer that I owned years ago, yes, that fast.  The print quality is excellent, again near laser quality.  Pictures look great when printed on photo paper (pretty good even on regular paper).  Scanning, copying and faxing all work very well.  I did experience some paper jams while faxing but I may have had the feed paper inserted slightly crooked.  You can also send pictures from your phone to the printer quite easily.

First of all, I love the appearance of the pen. It is very modern with the texturized body and cap, yet there is something classical about it. The Parker brand and logo is tastefully placed on the rim of the cap just adding to that luxury feel.

The grip section seems to be made of some kind of plastic and is comfortable to hold. The nib is much smaller in real life than it looks in the picture but I think it goes well with the overall design of the pen. As for writing, this pen is SMOOTH. I filled it with my Private Reserve American Blue ink (by the way, the converter is not included), and it writes like a $100+ pen. It writes with absolutely no pressure. It gives a nice medium line and does not scratch what so ever. I'm really enjoying it.

After a week or so though, your hand will adjust to it and you won't notice it at all. I like that, it sort of gives it a custom feel only you are used to.  The pen itself is very stylish,  and a great design.  I will say though that it is quite slick, and it can get VERY annoying while taking notes sometimes. Also it attracts finger prints VERY easily,  It is quite annoying as well, and it bothers me.  The ink is very good, drys reasonably fast, and has lasted my much longer than any other pen.  I tested it under water at 5 feet depth, it works great, but I did notice the next 2 or 3 times you use it, a small amount of water will appear in the first letter.  Overall though, very good pen, and do yourself a favor and order it with a clip! Otherwise it slides off the table to easily. I love it though, and I hope to have it in my EDC for the rest of my life.

Edit: (December 14th, 2014) Updated to five stars. Bought a clip for the pen and it is nearly two years old now. The chrome looks as good as the first day I bought it!

The printer is slow to start, slow to shut down, and constantly is ""cleaning"" ""testing"" and ""cycling the heads"" effectively meaning you have to wait several minutes if you want to print. Which is a real shame because it works flawlessly when integrating into a wireless network (wired ethernet is VERY problematic) prints well, is economical on ink, a full replacement set that will last me a year is $62.99. The scan quality is exception. Duplex printing is exceptional. Scans are clear, and wonderful. The software that comes from Canon is also very good. The two sided faxing and scanning works excellent.

But I can't get over the fact that it's picky about shut down, and takes far too long for the heads to figure out that they want to work. This isn't a shut down and start up issue either, it'll happen if it's been on for a good interval. If the MX922 would print a page from my computer in under 30 seconds rather than 3-5 minutes if it's been inactive for longer than 15 minutes it would rate a solid 3. If it wasn't so loud (dB meter says 109dB at 3 feet, you can hear it from outside the house when it's printing) it would rate a solid 5.

But whatever, if you buy it on sale and have plenty of time it'll serve you just fine. I just can't get over the fact that it's slower to get a document to print than using Apple Talk back in 1989.",This is easily one of the worst multi-function devices I have ever ...,1418860800,10,

My wife and I print documents more than anything else, making this printer a great choice. As others have noted, it is a shame that it doesn't automatically do duplex printing. This is a pretty common feature on much cheaper prints such as our Canon Pixma Color inkjet.

The scanner only works with the included software. This means if your printer is not next to your computer and you are scanning say part of a book, you will need to get up and turn a page then go back your computer. If you do a lot of such scanning, this printer will frustrate you, especially of books, since the top lid part easily comes off its hinges when scanning most books.  Why not take advantage of a touch screen and WiFi to let users scan and send images?

I like that it will copy and feed documents through the top, much like a larger photocopier, making that a useful feature.

Its ePrint or Airprint if you have a Mac or iOS iPhone/iPad are also great features and one I miss on our Canon printer.

Finally, I really dislike HP's software that overwarns and annoys when you dare install a non HP made new cartridge. While it may take some trial and error, there are many great companies that sell remanufactured or otherwise less expensive cartridges that work as well as OEM. The toner cartridge included with this printer has less toner than a full cartridge. I managed to get a generic tone replacement cartridge that didn't cause the printer to overreact and it says it will print about 1200 pages, which is at least double the page count of the starter cartridge.

I have noticed that sometimes the printer will refuse a print job. So far I've just been able to turn the printer on and off to resolve this issue. Otherwise I leave the printer on. The touch screen does turn off to save power, but it also comes back on randomly.

Most people agree that HP printers have bloated software, obtuse installation instructions, and expensive ink in tiny cartridges. They can be slow and noisy to boot. They last a few years or more, and they you replace them.

This is my third HP inkjet over about 18 years. Each one has been cheaper than the last with a trade off on build quality, paper handling and speed. A few years ago, getting tired of constantly replacing black ink cartridges, I installed a Canon multi-function monochrome laser to handle my text printing. That is for another review, but is was a great idea. The inkjet handles color jobs.

The 6000 replaced a 9860 that succumbed to a design flaw involving a spring that helps hold one of the cartridges. When it fails, it invariably pokes a ribbon cable and that is the end of the printer. I needed a printer that would fit into a specific shelf area under the desk, so a printer with vertical paper storage was out. Very few printers still load and deliver from the front of the printer. This printer had some things I was happy to finally have -- separate color cartridges so when you run out of blue, you replace blue only, and duplex printing. My wife is completing her dissertation, and she likes to print out drafts. Using the duplex AND printing 2 pages to a side helps cut down on the paper bill.

Now this model is not lightning fast. There is bigger model that may be better for heavier use. But it was inexpensive, prints well, and has some nice features. Sure the first time you buy a replacement set of cartridges (and get the XL versions) you will pay more than you paid for the printer, but that is just part of the inkjet game. This is a nice little printer, and what the heck, at this price you can't go wrong.",Works for me.  Decide what YOU need before buying,1279411200,,

Hotzone360 was prompt and helpful with resetting the printer when Epson stopped printing when it decided the cartridges MUST be empty.  It didn't work!  I was running again in minutes.

Two cons that are small for me but might be major for you:

1.  You must print every three or four days to keep the print heads open.  If you go five or six days you will need to run the print head cleaning routine.  That always works so not much of a problem.

2.  This ink is not like the water resistant Epson ink and will run and smear if you get the prints wet.

That aside the prints are very high quality.  I have just ordered refill ink for half the price of the original and look forward to even greater savings.

One more thing.  Once you are sure you have the clip arm positioned exactly right, super glue it in place.  The double sided tape will fail over time.

Addendum: I finally had a major problem.  Could not get the printer to print cleanly even running the head cleaning cycle multiple times.  Found the problem by reading the instructions from HotZone360.  I had allowed the ink to splash up into the air filters, which clogged the filter membrane, which stopped the air flow.  Simply punching a hole in the membrane with a finishing nail solved the problem until I can order replacement filters. (They are available from HotZone360 for a nominal cost.)

As other reviewers have stated, the hardware is solid (and heavy-but not too heavy for a typical desk). Set up was easy, although I would suggest having another person to hold the monitors while you mount them (although it can be done solo).

Like other reviewers, I had an initial problem with keeping the monitors in place. However, popping off the plastic caps will allow you to tighten the bolts-my monitors are held firmly in place with no problems. Of course, I just leave them in place rather than adjusting and tilting them-so I cannot attest to whether regular adjustment would result in slippage.

While I was a bit skeptical of the advantages of two monitors, I have been convinced. Being able to have multiple programs and windows open over two monitors does boost productivity.

I absolutely LOVE this planner. I have bought two in the past three years. The unfortunate part of this planner is that you cannot buy refills for it and must either make your own or buy custom ones off Etsy. I'm so happy I got the two when I did because these haven't been in stock in forever! I have watched it faithfully to see when it restocks but it's been so long I don't think it's ever  coming back.

The planner is great. It fits my lifestyle well. It's A5 sized (or half-sized) and has 3-rings in the binder. This makes for making custom pages for your own planner so much easier because you're not punching 6 holes but only 3 holes.

440110,5,False,"12 22, 2011",A2J7NOHEZ9BEID,B005IVL0SC,,German Vasquez Jr.,"I LOVE this series of Epson printers. I have both this model and the bigger 845 and use them nearly everyday for printing (color and b&w), scanning and copying. The printers work flawlessly with my MacBook Pro and there's even an Epson app for my iPhone/iPad (which I haven't used so can't say how well it works).

Setting up the printer for first use is easy (especially with Apple computers, which tends not to be the case with all of the other printers I've used in the past). I have always hated using inkjet printers because of how slow they are and the cost of ink, plus I've had other ink jets that just didn't do a good job of pairing wirelessly with my computers (whether Apple or PC). Neither of these are the case with this printer!

From the moment I hit print to the moment my document (1 sided b&w) is done takes less than 10 seconds including the printer waking up from sleep! That's fast. The text on it is very crisp and clean and never have there been smudges or paper jams.

Color printing is excellent as well, although I do not print in color very often. For scanning, I use the Image Capture software supplied by Apple and it works great. Double-sided printing is also included with this printer which makes a nice feature.

If you buy this product (and I recommend it highly), don't forget to get a printer cable.",Love it!,1324512000,,

I'll assume you already know you want a file folder that is paper size and has a little expansion (if you aren't sure, Yes, you do). Why this one?

1) It's good quality. I've been happy with 5-star products in the past (like the notebooks) and these keep up that standard. Both the outer cover and the elastic feel thick and sturdy.

2) Good quality removable pockets. Other folders can have fixed pockets and it is rare for them to be colored. These pockets are different colors, see-through, completely removable (I've used them separately at times), and a good thin-but-strong material.

3) Vertical Orientation. It's surprising how much of a difference this makes. Think of all the paperwork you have and whether the identifying marks are at the top or along the side. Mine are at the top. Also, my folders are either stored alongside books (in a vertical orientation), or in a bag or backpack (again, a vertical orientation).

Good & Bad:
1) It's big. It's big enough to hold larger-size music (one of the things I use it for).
2) The bottom sides are open (i.e., little things can fall out the bottom). This is typical since it would be harder to achieve otherwise.
3) The flap is large. Being harder to open is both good and bad. Good thing the inner pockets are removable.
4) There is limited expansion. Some expandable folders really get large, but these are limited by the width of the bottom (which doesn't expand).",Vertical is Versitile,1372636800,27,

It is hefty and the build quality is top notch. The seat and backrest are nicely contoured to cushion the body, and to provide the needed support to the lumbar. The bottom of the seat is fully covered by a molded plastic cover. There are no staples being cheaply used to attach things together, at least not visible from the outside.

The chair arrived in a big carton box with individual parts - the seat assembly, backrest, base with casters, pump assembly and armrests. It is easy to assemble. The included assembly instructions are fully illustrated and clear. 4 sets of bolts with washers and a hex key are provided.  No extra tools are required. I was able to put the chair together within 15 minutes by myself.

The chair has a very nice and form fitting fabric in the seat and backrest. It is very comfortable and has a good balance in firmness for overall support. The backrest can be raised or lower manually through a 5-position ratcheting mechanism. It reclines smoothly with the seat tilting at a 2:1 ratio and provides a nice feedback to your body as you recline. The seat can also slide forward and backward. In addition, the T-pad armrests can be adjusted horizontally and vertically, with molded soft plastic on the top pad that is nice and comfy to the touch. Other, usual chair adjustments such as height, tension and recline lock are done through left and right sided controls below the seat.

While the chair comes with assembly instructions that are clear and easy to follow, there are absolutely no instructions on how to use the controls, especially those below the seat. I have to spend quite some time trying to figure out which control does what. It is not always intuitive. Specially, the tension control doesn't seem to do anything, at least the tension doesn't seem to differ much no matter how much I turn the control.

The only quibbles I have with this chair are the plasticky controls below the seat. The recline lock control on the left and the tension control on the right are plastic poles that you simply pull out (and rotate) to adjust and push back in to hide. The feel a little weak and cheap. The are also two flapper controls next to the poles - left one for seat slide adjustment and the right for height adjustment. They are made of plastic and even the mechanical levers connected to them are all plastic. They feel a little flimsy and I seriously thought I would break by just squeezing too hard. I wish at least the levers and connectors were made of metal for durability sake. On the positive side, the poles have rubber molding on the handle that is easy to grip and rotate.

Another minor issue is the rattling sound the backrest makes when the chair is being shook or moved. The backrest seems to rest on a ratcheting frame and therefore it can wobble and rattle. It isn't loud but definitely noticeable in a quiet office environment.

Overall, this is an excellent task chair, well constructed and very comfortable. It provides a good lumbar support as well as a firm overall support for the body. It is not perfect and has its share of issues. That said, I'm still very pleased with it, enough that I have replaced my existing office chair with this one.",Comfortable and highly adjustable task chair but not without some minor issues,1444003200,,

A lot of the generic inks do more harm than good and a good majority of them are made by the same company under a different pseudonym and just repackaged. The usual problems with generic inks are leakage, printhead clogs, and the printer not recognizing the cartridge altogether. With this in mind I ordered these and was surprised how smoothly things went with my Kodak ESP5210.

The overall quality of the ink definitely falls short of brand name ink, but not too far behind in this case. I was able to produce great photo quality pictures and posters that were fantastic. There is also a good amount of ink in these that last for awhile, which is great for generic inks. A couple months down the line and there has been no problems whatsoever from me using these.

My last purchase of generic ink from another company resulted in a nightmare which caused me to replace my printhead (luckily Kodak took care of me for free otherwise I could've paid up to $40).

I liked the way it looked, color-wise.  It would go well with most school-aged students.  The colors aren't too bizarre but fit in well with most school decor.

Size....well, let's just say I was caught off guard when I opened it and found this little notebook.  Cute, but little.  It's all my fault as I didn't pay very much attention to the dimensions of the product when I ordered it.  The only thing I would say is that it can be compared to the size of a composition book.  If your child needs one and IF his/her child accepts one this is a decent substitute.

Your child's teacher may not accept it as homework paper because it is so small.  Note-taking, depending on the teacher/subject, may be a good use for it.  They will fit in a 3-ring button and I have to say, they're cute as a button.

As a professional, if I didn't use my iPad for note-taking, I'd probably look into using differently colored notebooks for keeping notes (learning team meetings, faculty meetings, parent conferences, etc....) and store them in a Trapper Keeper.  If I ever move away from my iPad, and I'm thinking of it, there's a good chance I'll do this.

They were all fulfilled by Amazon.com LLC. Upon closer inspection of the shipping boxes, all three came from the Suncast factory in the same shipment to Amazon. But they were not all the same. The first one that I assembled had a few deep scratches in the plastic resin. Also, the holes for the screws that hold the metal bracing to the top and the shelves did not line up and I had to screw two of them in at an angle on each shelf. Not a huge deal, except that this caused one of the screws to strip the plastic. Since it would be a major hassle to take it all apart and ship it back, I decided to live with the flaws.

The second and third ones that I assembled were much cleaner in appearance (but still scuffed in several places) and all of the holes aligned perfectly. The third one did have one small dent in the corner of the left door though. All in all, the quality control at Suncast seems a bit slipshod.

[The major benefit to true, duplex 5.8 GHz over 2.4 GHz systems is that 5.8s should not be interfered with by wireless networks & other household signals. However, some advertised 5.8 GHz systems actually use 2.4 Ghz for their intercom and paging functions.]

Anyway, I bought the base and 9 handsets. The base is in a central location (same place the V-Tech was) and none of the handsets is more than 100 feet from the base. The results: The 3 most peripheral handsets constantly lose their connection to the base and disconnect calls, rendering them effectively useless. The 3 handsets in what I would term the midrange zone hold their connections but have frequent but brief episodes of sound dropout. The remaining handsets, all within 25 feet of the base, sound good on my end but apparently not so great on the other parties' end.

Other drawbacks are an incredibly clumsy paging system, a caller ID call-back system that requires extra steps to select the dialing method each time (i.e., area code, 1+ or just the 7 digits must be selected every time), the need to setup the phonebook and speed dial on each handset individually, awful sound quality in both directions when using the handsets' speakerphone (dys)function, and lastly (but not least!), the inability to ever silence the base ringer.

On the plus side, the base speaker phone is superb and actually sounds better to callers than does the handset.

Well some pictures showed people clearly didn't know how to tape a box. Crease to crease all the way around - or just continue from where you taped the bottom from and stopped the tape. Then for added strength run a second path opposite to your first direction (perpendicular) around the girth of the box end to end. So it looks like an H. That is how your a supposed to tape a box.

Some recycled material boxes will act different. While heavy duty tape seems better, I have yet to see a break in the seal yet with this stuff.

Also adhere to the guidelines on your box certificate (on the bottom flap) - if it says 65lbs maximum weight, then that is what it means. Rule of thumb is to not exceed 50% of rated capacity in case the box is dropped from 5 feet (standard test).

Just thought that might help a little. Keeping it in a cool dark place is also ideal, and even keeping the open package inside a ziplock freezer bag will help if not using right away.

I always am a little nervous when choosing another color of ink to purchase because sometimes they are not what the color sample on line looks like. This was spot on with what I was hoping for a dark green with a hint of black, I think it would be safe to call it green-black. I assume this is probably why they don't ask my input for names when designing the colors. I have become a fan of Noodler's ink not only for the great colors or the fact that I really enjoy the way the inks I have used write so nicely, but their sound business practices.

The bottles are as full as they can possibly be because they buy industry standard bottles so the manufacturers can't jack the prices on them. If the manufacturers decide to then they buy bottles else where. I enjoyed reading this statement on their web site ""We believe the product is ink and that the glass bottle serves as the product container...and that our customers are buying it because every bit of value has been concentrated in the ink and its properties (not a flashy bottle with a limited glass form that is subject to single glass manufacturer price increases!).""

I really enjoy the larger screen (including the switchable landscape display) with much higher resolution, sd card slot, a faster processor, bluetooth and wifi (although NOT the latest versions that are now available from other vendors), albeit with a significant reduction in battery life (From ~8 hrs for the Z22 to ~5 hrs for the T|X during normal operations with an even much shorter operating time using wifi unless the conserve power mode is turned on in the user preferences window). The wifi connection was extremely simple to setup as well as operate unlike the version included with the MS Windows Mobile 6.0 OS. This pda is also much better suited for the included Microsoft Windows Suite (Word, Excel and Powerpoint) so that I can also get some serious work done with the unit too. It also has a good calculator and many are also available for the PALM OS on the web. I have also purchased a Think Outside IR keyboard which contrary to earlier reviews works perfectly with very low power consumption with the T|X. Wait until they lower the price again and get extra accessories like a desktop cradle, Saunders-Rhinoskin hard metal protective case, USB hotsync cable and plug-in adapter for charging/operating in a car (which also works fine contrary to other available reviews), screen protectors, spare stylii, an extended warranty beyond 1 year, etc.

  I find that as a scientist I use this thing for most everything keeping track of my day to day demands as well as helping me to organize and plan all of my future activities. The PALM OS is far superior to the Microsoft system in my opinion. I just hope that PALM keeps producing these fine units. If they ever do design and produce new pdas, I fervently wish that they would make the internal battery user replaceable however.

  Finally, I do have one serious complaint, not because I believe that Palm will ever change the choice of software that is provided on the TX, but because I just would like to alert other users to this problem. The Microsoft (MS) office package of Word, Excel and Power-point provided is called the Premium Edition and will not plot any graphs at all (which I was hoping for without spending any more money), but to get the graphic plotting capability you must separately purchase the very expensive Professional Edition available from DataViz! To provide a product called the Premium Edition that doesn't even plot simple graphics or allow you to create simple slides or even allow any simple spell checking capability is a joke in my humble opinion.

Pro:
 1. Powered by USB directly. So, I now don't need to power it up/down between scanning jobs any more.
 2. Very thin. And is smaller than my visioneer scanner.
 3. Work with the latest Paperport software (ver 11).
 4. The scanner driver provides quite some options. Good for fine tuning.
 5. Scanning speed is good (depends on resolution).

Con:
 1. The lid can be raised about 1 inch for book scanning. But, can not scan think books.

Granted, the quality is not the same as buying an individual card, they are pretty budget but the designs are pretty and they even have foil and texture embellishments.

Keep in mind that the pictures may not match the cards you get exactly. I have a Santa with a blue background, a Santa/Snowman/Reindeer, and a Santa suit without his face.

Foolishly, I dismissed those reviews -- all seemed inexact, and too subjective. I shouldn't have. These folders really ARE thinner than normal, insufficiently robust to be used for anything but the lightest filing needs. Very often, I need to add a two-hole punch to the tops of the folders I'm using, then add a two-prong clip. That's just not practical with these folders; such heavy use would tear them to pieces quickly.

A huge problem here is the absolute absence of information provided by the manufacturer and/or seller. Card stock is typically reported by ""points"" or ""mils."" This is the thickness of a sheet in thousandths of an inch. Such info would be enormously useful for consumers trying to decide which products to purchase blind. A typical business card is about 9.5 pt., while a grocery sack is around 7.6 pt. These folders are pretty close to the lightest business cards I've collected in recent months, so around 9 pts. I'll bet a better (more ""standard"") file folder would be around 10-11 points. (Or alternately, by paper weight: card stock ranges from 50 to 110 pounds). Why doesn't Amazon or the seller provide this kind of information? Without it, you ARE buying blind. With it, you could more intelligently balance out cost v. need.

Anyhow, only two stars because these are NOT truly ""standard"" filer folders. They are perfectly usable for light long-term filing, but not for adding 2-prong clips or frequent reference use.",Other reviews are right: too light!,1523664000,12,

I got this one because I spend a lot of time at my desk; and I wanted something that was comfy for more than just the first five minutes you sit in it.

I will say putting it together is simple, but may take to people (or a crap ton of arm strength and ingenuity) because the last screw is a stubborn one. TIP: Do NOT tighten the other screws all the way until you have all screws partially secured. But other than that I didn't have any assembly issues. I'm pretty small (5'2/130) and just had a baby about 4 weeks before putting the chair together and I could lift the box and assemble the pieces just fine.

With that said, if you are about my height, your feet may not touch the floor (mine graze it when the chair is on the lowest setting). Not a big deal for me cause I usually sit Indian-style while I'm at my desk. If you are big and/or tall, this is probably a good chair for you as well. My husband (5'10/170) tries to take it all the time now because he says the cushions make him feel like a ""baseball in a baseball glove"".

Also I love the glossy silver metal finishes, the lumbar support, and the leather cushioning on the armrest.

So, I hopped on Amazon and used the wisdom of the Average Customer Review feature to choose a proper sharpener for my lovely and fancy Prismacolor pencils.  And voila!  I got paired up with this.  I'm pretty happy with it so far; it gives me a variety of possible pencil points (say that five times fast), isn't wrecking my pencils and the pencil shavings don't stick too badly to the blade.  I find that there's less maniacal banging on the trash can to empty this thing.  My husband appreciates that feature.

Colored folders are an excellent tool for getting your filing organized.  Color code files of like type and find them easily from across the room!  The ""Super Tab"" feature is not a big selling point for me.  Obviously a 1/3 cut tab can only have so much width so the extra room is top to bottom-not side to side.  You can have multiple lines of text on the tab label but you're only going to be able to SEE the same top 1-2 rows as on a normal folder. Either the paper inside the file or the folder in front will block all that extra area from view rendering it virtually useless. This feature doesn't detract from the file so as long as these folders don't cost more than a standard tabbed file, there is no harm done.  I certainly wouldn't pay a premium for them though.

Remember that to take advantage of the ""Super Tab"" you'll need to get an oversized label and reformat your label documents accordingly.....",Brighten up your dreary office!,1300752000,,

I'm passing this pen along to someone else. While it's a good pen and writes well, the line is too thick for my preferences, and the pen is too large in my hand. It is not heavy, though, and that's a huge benefit.  So this gets five starts, and it deserves five stars, even if I didn't love it. It's a personal preference for a different size pen and a dislike of the thicker line, but I knew the dimensions of the pen and that it lays a thick line before I bought it.","Really Good Pen, but not my personal style",1478476800,2,

I vow to only use this ruler to for things that make me happy.

First stop, measuring my fondant for cakes.  Cakes make me happy and a straight line makes me even happier.  I just wish that they made the metal on the edge a bit sharper, that way if someone tries to come in on me and tries to steal said cake, then I could defend my sugary goodness.

However, I do have a nifty magnet knife holder that has 5 long chefs knives on it, so I guess they will have to do in an emergency.

Also, I'd like to add, I haven't gotten any splinters yet in my fondant.

The Blackwing line In order from lightest to darkest is: 602, Pearl, Traditional.  And I've found that the Pearl is the best compromise.  It's the perfect mix of tip strength and dark lines.  If you've read the hype, you might have heard that you get darker lines with less pressure with Blackwing pencils.  Indeed, versus a regular $0.20 HB pencil, the writing experience is a night and day difference.  You can write faster and with much less effort--almost as if you were using a rollerball pen.  Is it worth 10x the price?  Probably not.  But if you've read this far, you're probably the kind of person who could appreciate the improvement in quality--irrespective of price.

I replaced the erasers with Palomino's green replacements, which I think look great against the gold and white.  But the stock black ones look sleek too.  Unfortunately, neither is very good at actually erasing--you should get a dedicated eraser for that.

It's the perfect length, width, and height, for your standard keyboard. It's got a non-skid bottom. It has just enough give to provide support without total rigidity.

Update November 2010:

We purchased these for our 9-1-1 center early in 2006, and we still use the same exact ones that were purchased then! At that time I went right out and bought them for my home computers as well. A few other wrist rests have floated through dispatch during the past few years, but no one likes them, and everyone who uses a wrist rest (90% of us) chooses this one. I myself have tried many different wrist rests during my last couple of decades at the computer... padded foam, clear gel, flat, curved, etc. These are the best, and they stand the test of time.

I didn't want to invest in anything too expensive if I decided that it was no for me, so I decided to buy this Jinhao 250 because it was just stunning to look at and actually made me want to use the pen.

Fast forward 5 months into the future. I have gained experience in fountain pens and now also have a Pilot Metropolitan and I gotta say that this pen was well worth the investment. Of course since the price was so cheap it was definitely not the greatest pen out there, but this pen gets better with age. In the beginning in my opinion, the nib was too toothy and ink did not flow as well. I was constantly frustrated at how much it would tear at the paper I was writing on it with and it just made me frustrated. But I definitely did not give up. I kept using is over and over again and I began to notice changes. Over time the nib smoothed out and now it writes on paper like butter. It is still a little heavy for me so I can't use it for longer than 30 minute sessions but the medium nib lets out ink generously although it is a bit of a dry nib. The dryness however is great on cheap paper and I can definitely jot down notes during my college lectures on my cheap dollar notebooks without any bleed through with a well behaving ink.

I really like the strokes that this guy makes and I can't get enough. It does have a rough start but transforms into a beautiful swan. The included converter although not the best quality out there has lived through 5 months of constant use and will continue to last me well onto a year. You pay a small price for such a great foray into a world of wonderful pens and brilliant inks. I definitely recommend the Jinhao as a great starter pen.

I use red and yellow colored pencils at work - either Ticonderoga or Col-Erase brand.  We have a standard AC powered pencil sharpener from Panasonic but it doesn't work very well with colored pencils.  It doesn't leave enough wood surrounding the pencil tips and they break off easily.  Colored pencils have leads that are both soft and brittle. I measured the sharpening angle of the Panasonic and it's only 16 degrees.  No wonder it never worked very well with colored pencils.

The Staedtler sharpener has two holes:  23 degrees and 30 degrees.
Either one works well with colored pencils.  It's a vast improvement over the standard old Panasonic office sharpener.  The 30 degree hole is larger than a standard Col-Erase colored pencil diameter, so it's not as easy to use as I would wish, but it's still usable.  (Based on that, I would give it 4.5 stars). The 23 degree hole is the standard pencil size diameter and it works well with colored pencils, so it's no real problem.

You just have to get used to the end of them because it changes the more you use one side (like a crayon). BUT because of this you can have a skinny, medium, or thick line all depending on what you want. It's great.

They glide across your paper, they never ever bleed through, they are really vibrant colors, and can see the lightest of pencil through them very clearly. They can't dry up, even if you loose the cap off. Unlike regular highlighters, they can't run out of ink. If you accidently loose the cap, just roll up the pen and it will never get color on anything.

I've had the same pink, orange, and yellow set since they first came out and the colors are as bright as when I first bought them, despite the fact that I lost the cap to two of them a long time ago. The color never fades or smears either. Papers that I highlighted two years ago are just as bright today! I can highlight right over freshly written gel ink and it still won't smear.

I just bought the new blue and green colors and they are just as amazing just like the original colors. I never will go back to the old fashioned highlighters.",Best highlighter ever,1345939200,2,

The big problem is that I now have a stack of several dozen pages over the last hour - one with the ethernet and one with the ""failed to associate"" wireless for each vain attempt.  It doesn't say why, I can't monitor the connection progress, it gives no details...  Meanwhile it doesn't remember the IP address to ask for the same one, so I have to change all my computers assuming I can ever get it connected.  It is fine as long as everything is working.  When it isn't, it is so completely broken that you can't restore connectivity.

I literally have 3 laptops running one of each of the OSes and they are all connected to the printer.  I used the Mac for the setup.

WINDOWS OR MAC FOR SETUP will be easy, especially if you attach it via ethernet or USB to start.

I was able to do the setup entirely via wireless, using my Mac though the included setup application was a bit touchy about finding and associating with the printer's default adhoc.  When done though, the web page came up and I moved everything to my main AP (though you do have to do the reset printserver on the network setup page).

It might be possible to do the setup under Linux or anything else with a browser using the web page.

By default it creates a 169.254 IP address and a ""SETUP"" ad-hoc network on channel 11, so if you join you can use the web page.  This info is visible from the setup page you get by holding the go button in for 10 seconds.  Then accessing the 169.254... address admin/access for user/pass, you should be able to configure it completely.

30 surfaces per minute - so duplex is 15 sheets per min, but is fast!

It just works.  The web page configuration is well thought out and works well (but needs javascript).  As I noted, I didn't have to attach ethernet or usb.

1200DPI will be at half speed.
HQ1200 is 2400x600.

600 dpi is crisp and clear though so I will rarely use the higher rez.

For linux, I chose the HL-5270DN driver which seems to work perfectly, but used ""ipp://192.168.1.111/"" style for the ""Device URI"" since the auto-detect found it by Bonjour or something but wouldn't connect when the configuration was finished (I'm using xubuntu).

Downsides:  Drum is expensive, I don't know the life.  Trays are also expensive but at least are available - 2x and you will be printing large docs (like I need) without stopping.  Non refill toner is also a bit expensive.

Upsides: Duplex is proportionately fast, some printers go to 1/3 or 1/4 when duplexing instead of 1/2.  Inexpensive, but has all the interfaces for a network printer.  Easy to configure (though not quite painless, is any network printer painless?).  Compact so fits anywhere, light enough to move.

This is based on just installing and starting some massive print jobs, but having it work on 3 different OS computers with out major headaches, I'm giving it 4 stars.

The 5th star is withheld since the configuration tool is touchy and probably not needed, and supplies are expensive v.s. the printer cost.  Call it 4-1/2.","Works Linux, Mac, Windows, Easy, simple, fast",1276560000,9,

I could use it for business (and I have used bound presentations before) but what I use this for most is for personal stuff: home made bible studies, book club worksheets, and play lines. There are a multitude of great reasons why a business (or church or theater company or club or whatever) would use and really value something like this. And much cheaper than FedEx Office!

CONSTRUCTION: solid plastic with a gunmetal colored top. The level and insides (like threading teeth, etc) are metal for the most part and this is a heavy. Very well built and solid.

USE: This was a little daunting at first. There are several levers and even a dial to line up the threads, paper, PVC/ plastic sheets (cover), and the comb pieces (binding pieces). To top it off there are multiple different comb sizes (fortunately the comb tray comes with a sizing chart where you fit the combs in to see what size you select. Comb size is directly related to how many papers you want in your binding.)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Cut your pages. You can cut up to 20 sheets or 3 plastic pages at a time. Have them all ready to go before going to #2.
2) Prepare the comb. The instructions don't tell you how to put the comb in place very clearly. Here is how: put in behind the silver spokes and slide it down so that the loops are facing the front of the machine. When you have the comb lever back (towards the back) and pull forward your comb should spread out. Pull the level forward until you get to the end. Not too far or it will pop off. And set the comb to the leftist starting point. NOTE: don't do this until you are ready to place the papers as the comb will stretch out and won't hold it's shape well.
3) Place the papers on to the open comb and when finished close the comb lever and it should all go together. Viola!

OVERALL: Once you get used to the steps this is a very easy tool. And extra combs run 100 for about $5 on Amazon. Plastic covers run less than $10 as well. So if you are running off a dozen presos, Bible studies, book club worksheets, or lines for your next play this is a pretty inexpensive way of making really nice bound handouts.

It keeps your files (or papers) at hand, either on your desk or nearby, on the top of a bookshelf or credenza or what have you, and separates them in a way that is orderly and keeps the various files (or papers) visible and accessible.

I've used these for a number of years and just obtained two more for my new office since the ones I already have are still in storage. The two that I have just received this week are this exact version (72614 model, in black) and were purchased for me by the office supplies person so I did not purchase them myself from Amazon, but this is where I will come if I need to purchase more for my own personal use. The price here is reasonable in my opinion.

The organizer comes with rubber covers for the feet that must be pressed in place and then it's ready to go. It's well made, the eight pieces are aligned properly and everything is square and correctly connected together. It's made from steel pieces that are thickly enough painted that I expect it to last for a reasonably long time without any visible wear or deterioration, in fact the ones I've used in the past have not shown any deterioration that I have noticed.

This particular model has one slight disadvantage that should be pointed out: the frame is quite wide at the base, and when putting normal sized 8  x 11 inch papers into the slots, or papers within letter sized manila folders, care must be taken to place the papers or folders well centered or they will not reach to both of the side supports. The width of the frame does make it very stable on the desktop.

And to that point, Fellowes does make these 'step files' in several different sizes, so someone who is interested in purchasing this type of organizer should either look at these in an office supplies store to be sure they are the size wanted, or take careful note of the dimensions in order to get the one most suitable for your particular desktop or location.

This particular product is available in silver (72604) or black (72614).

Go to Dymo's Website ([...]) and click on ""support - drivers & downloads"". From here you can download the latest software AND drivers and you'll be good to go. If this is a first time installation, don't plug in the USB printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download.
