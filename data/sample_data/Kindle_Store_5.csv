699767,5,True,"06 11, 2014",A2ALPKLPIOKKPI,B00KTE0B2Y,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},M.E. Belle,"C.L. Foster and E.R. Rada have teamed up to deliver a fresh new take on historical romance that is sure to leave readers in awe. Heart of War is set in the majestic era of knights and kings and the Hundred Years War. Adalira and Bastian are the children of nobles with their hearts set on the battlefield. Adalira is expected to be prim and proper as a Lady usually is, but she longs to wield a sword. Bastian is expected to be a diplomat, but his dream is to be a knight. When they meet, they just might be each other's key to breaking free of the mold and winning their families over.

I had the brilliant opportunity to beta-read this lovely story and I fell in love from the beginning. The characters are very well-rounded and easy to love, each of them unique with a great deal of personality. The world in which they live is vividly detailed, leaving nothing to the imagination while allowing the reader to become lost in the story. I'd consider this artwork at its finest, a picture painted in words dripping with creativity, talent, and passion for the craft.

The collaboration between C.L. Foster and up-and-coming author E.R. Rada is genius. They compliment each other well without breaking the story. While they each have their own writing style, the chapters flow together nearly seamlessly and, if you had not known better, it would be easy to believe that this book was penned by only one author.

I am looking forward to the next book by these two inspiring novelists, be it a collaboration or solo work. If you haven't picked up Heart of War yet, I urge you to do yourself a favor and take a chance on it.

P.S. My favorite character is Ezra. I'd say it was almost like he was written specifically for me. *wink* <3",Splendid work from an unstoppable author collaboration!,1402444800,2,
2175663,4,False,"04 13, 2016",A2VT1QJM4HCSG8,B01CKLUUTW,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},IslandDeb,"Dirty Girl is provocative, deliciously decadent, and sexy as hell.  It will shock you, and at times, it may disgust you.  But if you're like me, you won't be able to put it down.  Allie Cooke has written a story that is much more than initial appearances. Which is key to why it kept my attention.  Ill admit, the utter down and dirty, unapologetically nasty behavior these characters engage in more than grabbed my attention.  However, the measured and precise manner Ms. Cooke uses to reveal the how's and whys of our heroine Charity, impressed me.

I love damaged characters!  And Charity is on her way to being crowned Ms. Broken, Bruised, and Battered.  Charity certainly doesnt make the best first impression on us.  Her penchant for trolling a different bar each week, carefully (or not so carefully) choosing a stranger, hauling him into the men's room and begging him to boink her brains out isn't exactly lady-like behavior.  Its been her addiction for quite some time, and she has absolutely no remorse over it.  In fact, she prefers living her life this way.  Its not just the no strings aspect that turns her on.  It's the danger, the thrill of being discovered, the excitement of being watched.  My first thought...damn, this girl is playing with a loaded gun.  And then I settled in to watch her crash and burn.  Which doesnt happen the way I expected it to.  What happens is Boone.

""He was someone like meexcept not. Where I at least paid lip service to the rules, I got the feeling Boone shot them the bird and did as he pleased. Even in my crazy little *censored*-up world, there was order. There had to be. Boone, however didn't know the meaning of order, or rules, and that fascinated me as much as it terrified me.""

 Dirty Girl Book 1 is our meet and greet with Charity and Boone.  Ms. Cooke feeds us morsels of Charitys real life; not quite enough yet to figure her out or forgive her for her abominable behavior.  It is, however, a promise of more to come, and once again had my brain working to make sense of this girl.  Boone has his own agenda, which seems chivalrous and yet
Needless to say, Im hooked on Dirty Girl and cant wait for the next installment.

Nina is still struggling to remember her life and Tristan. He is loving and kind and she's grateful for that but is apprehensive about it all. (Especially because she thinks she is not worthy of a man as hot as him.) She falls back in love with him all over again even while not knowing all the facts.

Tristan is a nervous wreck. He wants more than anything for Nina to remember him. He loves her so much and wants her in his life always. He's so afraid that he will lose her anyways after getting this 2nd chance with her over the secrets he's been keeping inside.

This book holds lots of secrets, lies, deception, death, loss, jealously, learning self-worth, love, friendships and more!

I loved Nina in this book. She was more open and said and did things she didn't do in book 1. She believed in them as a couple and fell in love with Tristan all over again w/out knowing his secrets. She is his rock and I enjoyed her character, personality, faith and support in Tristan.

Tristan well him... I was mad, upset and frustrated with him at times.. but still loved him! He loves Nina so much and would do anything to keep her! He doesn't want to give her up. He learns a lot of secrets in this book regarding his family and it shocks him. I felt so sorry for him. He's such an emotional man and I loved that about him.

Once you start this book you will devour it. The characters, plot and emotions are phenomenal. It will leave you breathless and needing/wanting more!

by Jessica Ruddick

I wanted to really like Wanting More, more then I did.

Wanting More is the second novel in this series, I should have realized that when I requested this one.

Wanting More is told in Dual POV, Bri and Josh. There was a lot of push and pull, some banter and emotional moments. Both had their pasts to deal with, but they also learned to deal with them.

Honestly i'm not sure I liked this more or less by the time I was finished.

The characters annoyed me and I just couldn't get into it, it took me longer to read this one.

We have a little love, friendship, drama In Wanting More.

  It is when we are willing to get outside ourselves and do for others that we are able to overcome the pain & grief in our own lives.  Nate Saylor was a famous football player whose game-losing fumble had knocked his team out of the playoffs for the Super Bowl.  Other things weren't going well for him publicity-wise either and he wasn't trying to correct the public's view.  His agent pretty much forced his hand to work with Moments for Miracles as damage control.
  Nate still had not overcome his grief at losing his little brother to an unknown illness years before.  Now there was one little boy dying from leukemia who idolized Nate and his wish was to meet him.  When Nate conceeded to the visit it became so much more than he had anticipated.  Little Zac and his mom, Shayna, both had faith God could and would answer their prayers and their faith soon drew Nate back to the faith he had put aside.
  As the story progresses Nate becomes more & more involved with Zac & his mom and God brings unexpected blessings to everyone involved.  As we look below the surface we find God's way is the best way.  This is a good love story with a strong faith message.

Searching for Harrison's biography only gives bits and pieces of inspiration for the novels; we do know that Harrison lives in North Carolina, has a day job, and writes books in spare time. Gender: not designated, though the Facebook page refers to VG as `him' - and perhaps that ups the ante on the mystery that pervades this little work that adroitly mixes supernatural/paranormal, science fiction and horror. Now we have a word from the author about the concept of his current novels: `Project Solstice is a top secret initiative that explains why the government spends $20,000 on toilet seats and $49,000 on cuff links. The extra money has to go somewhere and this secret organization has been on the receiving end for decades, long before the Roswell Incident. But if you're looking for information about that or Area 51, you won't find it here. The ""aliens"" have lived in our fairytales as skinwalkers, vampires, and nymphs as far back as anyone can remember. Unfortunately, they're real. But, that's not what Project Solstice is about. It's about what the government has been doing with the technology that brought them here.'

Still with one volume to go this reviewer would recommend reading the entire trilogy, of which this is Book 2. Not that DEPARTMENT 51 cannot stand on its own as a complete story - it can, but the background from SECTION 51 heightens the experience of delving into this book. Grieving of the murder of her triplet brother Ian, Ava Frost discovers a threat from the loathed Department 51 - she is to be imprisoned for bizarre criminal charges. Remember that Ava is an empath (an empath is someone with the ability to scan another's psyche for thoughts and feelings or for past, present, and future life occurrences). She learns that a sentient, complex computer program called Ian 2 has been imprinted with her brother's anagrams. But even more sinister, the computer is linked to her brain, sharing the same organic metal as her cybernetic implant. Department 51 wants her to disable Ian 2, but when an alien craft threatens the Earth, Ava discovers her brother's computer program may be the only key to deciphering the invaders' intentions.

VG Harrison writes with language appropriate to the characters and moves the story along as fast as a space ship spinning out of control. Even for those who do not relish sci-fi or paranormal or alien tales, Harrison writes in a manner that remains propulsive. As bizarre as the characters and actions are, they become part of our psyches - polished writing such as this is a gift.

After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling.  I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is!  Twain's humor never fails him.  I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing.  I say ""involving"" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination.  My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling.

You truly end up feeling for Sam. She doesn't annoy you with whining or play the victim card too strongly, instead making her perspective clear until all you want to do is root for her to come out on top.

Who knew HJ Bellus could make powdered donuts the newest aphrodisiac?
She made Adam Spahn even hotter by creating the big bad wolf- Van Hollis- Cover alone captures you, but the story nailed it!
It is so damn good that you just cant put it down!

HJ Bellus has absolutely astounded me with her newest release. Its dark, gritty, intense and the heat coming off it will threaten to melt your ereader! Its unlike anything else shes written and known for and shes pulled it off flawlessly.

The Hunted is a dark romantic read. Its intense to say the least! Van Hollis is the epitome of the big bad wolf and Basil is his lamb to slaughter. Like a moth drawn to a flame, Basil cant stay away from her bad boy neighbor. His mysterious draw is too intense. Bellus did an amazing job at writing a super dark alpha man that oozes a broody sex appeal like no other character out there. He is compelling not only to Basil but to the reader. I could not get enough of Van Hollis. His broken strength fascinated me in ways I did not expect.

Lets get real- The sex scenes in this book Lord have mercy on my soul. If Van Hollis were real every woman on the planet would be lined up outside his door just waiting on a turn. Be ready ladies, Bellus has written a book that is gonna leave you hot and bothered! If that doesnt capture your attention, then her heart pounding murder plot will.

Not only did Bellus write an exceptionally hot brooding sex on a stick alpha, she wrote an amazing story filled with twists, turns, and jaw dropping moments. Some so surprising itll have you reading all over again! Bellus was strong in her writing, unafraid of taking risks, pushing boundaries and she killed it! Ive been a big fan of her writing for sometime and by far, this is her best work to date. The story itself was intense leaving you checking over your shoulder as you read the characters uneasiness of the environment and situation around them. Are the good guys truly good or should you seek comfort in the bad?

I cant begin to say enough wonderful things about this book. Bellus killed it on so many levels that if you weren't a fan before reading this book, you will be after. I was completely overtaken by this story and did not want it to end. However, I am so excited to see what Bellus has in store for us in the future after reading this amazing book. Things are only going up for Bellus as she continues to give us her amazing stories!

Ive since gotten to know her over the internet.  Ive made some suggestions (largely and wisely ignored) and now purchased the book. Ive not been paid a thing nor asked to write a review. NO SPOILERS.

Rachel Burns has a great talent for two things:  She writes characters who compel me to care about them  or loathe them.  I get upset when they are mistreated and cheer for their successes.  Part 4 continues this: I care about Brianna and want to ___ [omitted, LOL] ___ Scott.

The second thing that Ms. Burns does very well is twist plots.  While Heart remains a boy-meets-girl story, her twists in the plot continue to surprise me.  Many are what I call ka-thunk moments: those times when I realized that the author has flushed the toilet and, instead of draining, it is overflowing on this or that character in an unexpected way.  Gritty but savored.

I cant count.  There is a third aspect of Ms. Burns books I enjoy, one that continues in Heart Part IV.  Her characters are not runway models.  By this I mean that in almost every book there is a significant person with a medical issue.  Here, Brianna has a major, life threatening, heart condition. Authors create worlds for readers to enjoy. We willingly suspend disbelief to enter.  Disorders, conditions and illnesses make that easier for me.  However, Ms. Burns is not on a soapbox. She isn't advocating for a cause, a medical condition with a colored ribbon. The best word might be illustrating  she illustrates that average people can star in the imaginary world(s) a good book creates.

What don't I like about Heart IV?  I would not read this book out of order - you need to read Parts 1 to 3 first.  There are fewer DD / corporal punishment elements than some readers of this genre may expect.  When you read Heart IV youll understand why.  Just saying.

I tried to like this book, but really it wasn't anything spectacular.  I think part of the problem was I couldn't connect with any of the characters.  The two most interesting characters were Djimon and Kei and they were not the main focus of the story.  Those two were already mated at the beginning and it made me wonder if there was a book written about them out there.  As far as Alan and Thony(I kept calling him Thorny in my head for some reason), I didn't really care about their romance.  I did feel sorry for Alan losing his first mate so young, but not enough for me to really like him as a character.

Basically, I was pretty bored throughout and skimmed much of the last half of the book.  My friend lent me her copy and I'm really glad I didn't pay for it.  She also lent me book two, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get into that one either. One thing I did like was that Thony was a persian cat shifter.

If you're looking for quick vampire reads that tug at your heart, consider reading Laura Kaye's Vampire Warrior Kings series.  One of the things why I continue to enjoy this series is because each installment takes part in a different part of the world.  In Taken by the Vampire King, the reader is transported to beautiful Norway.

Vampire Warrior King, Henrik Magnusson is ill.  He's dying and has pretty much accepted his fate.  As the fight against the Soul Eaters continue, Henrik rescues a woman who he seems to be undeniably drawn to. Will she be able to save him?

I think for me the first book, In the Service of the King, has been my favorite of the series thus far. It was my first introduction to this particular vampire world.  With that being said, Ms. Kaye does a great job explaining this vampire world in each book making them wonderful, novella-length, standalone reads.

I just loved the setting and the insights to the Northern Lights in Taken by the Vampire King.  As someone who has never seen these natural light displays in real life, I found the mythology behind the Aurora Borealis to be quite fascinating!  Henrik and Kaira find they have a lot of things in common. Their romance is a heart-warming one!

The east Indian flavor world sprinkled with steampunk creates such pretty pictures in my head.  Bollypunk, indeed!  I wasn't sure I was going to love it at first but I did.  I totally fell in love.

Aniri is a passionate girl.  Her emotions lead her decisions most of the time.  In the beginning, what she wants most is to marry for love.  I don't think that desire ever goes away but at some point Aniri focus shifts to her loyalty to her land, people and queen.  It is always her heart leading the way though and I really loved that.  Aniri is strong (but not too strong), brave and loyal.  She does have a smart, quick mind that has just never really had the opportunity to shine.  As the third daughter, not much was expected from her in that way.  It was satisfying to watch her grow and use her mind and realize that she had value.

The world that was created for me was vivid and alive.  I could see things and smell them.  I loved the intrigue and danger.  It was just a fantastic feast for my senses and my heart.  I was so sad when it ended.  I didn't want to put that book down and I didn't want to leave the story.

Skye, Rox and Dante are funny as hell. Okay so with a BFF like Rox who Wouldn't LOL?  She's quirky and fun.

Step-Sibling relationships are considered taboo. Depending on the person each person has their opinion. That's why they are are ""your opinions"". I thought this book was funny, sexy and heartbreaking altogether.

Skye / Dante didn't know they were step siblings when they made out. You can't help who you're attracted to. Can't help who you fall in love with. Sure it's controversial being step siblings but they're not blood relatives. So to each their own. I think I may have swooned over Dante myself if I were Skye.

A smuggler by trade, Colin makes for an embarrassing chieftain. He cant even save his friends from their British pursuers without getting himself captured. But before he is martyred by the hangmans noose, Colin escapes with his cellmate, a brave lad hes come to admire. Its only in the depths of the Highlands that Colin discovers the lad is a lassand a bonnie one at that.

Raised by her older brothers, Maggie Sinclair can drink a pint in no time flat and wield a dagger with the best of em. Still, men have always excluded her and women have always shunned her. Colin makes her feel different. His wild spirit and rugged good looks have Maggie reconsidering her less than ladylike  ways. For the first time, shes tempted to put on a gown, just to see how Colin would react. She can only imagine what might happen next: a kiss . . . a touch . . . and perhaps enough sultry heat to melt a cold Highland night.

This book managed to grab my attention from the beginning chapter.  Both Maggie and Colin were great Main Characters.  They had a hard time fitting into anyone's mold for them but I really liked their style.  They would probably fight with anyone that said that they had some things in common.  Like, being fierce, stubborn and going their own way, when they wanted and how they wanted.  In fact at least one person did say that exacty and was able to grin and find humor in it.  Colin had some negative voices in his head from his father and brothers.  They all were disappointed in him and he constantly had to battle their words of, he'd never amount to anything.  They had said it so much that even while they are dead, he still felt like a failure.  When Maggie figured that out, she wasn't going to put up with any of that.  She saw who he really was and she liked what she saw.  Colin was afraid of his developing feelings for Maggie.  He admired her and she often surprised him and she wasn't like any other woman he had ever met.  BUT still even though he wanted her, he had nothing to offer her.  But of course, that does begin to change or where would we have a HEA ending?  It was interesting to see how that came about.

Rock is brutal and honest and can stick up for his woman like nobody's business. His background is not so nice but he has a sweet side that wins you over.

The sexy times are a plenty but not repetitive making them chilli, spicy, naughty. The bdsm element isn't too overdone as I'm usually not a fan.

I loved that we got a little more of Mumma and Dare, and the rest of the Jericho Brotherhood.

There are TWISTS and TURNS and Oh my they are some good ones. I really like how the story lets your think its over then there is more JOY!!!

All up a great addition to the series that I really hope to continue on with.",Brilliant!!,1477180800,,

On the Inside is a fast paced mystery novel with great characters, an entertaining romance subplot and a scary serial killer you cant wait for Hazel to catch.

Focused on herself, the last thing shes looking for is a new relationship, but when shes faced with the cop who saved her, the one who never forgot about her, everything changes.

The Verdict: When Hunter Sloan finds out the woman he rescued and never forgot is his new neighbor, hes immediately drawn to her.  Of course, Evangeline isn't ready to rush into romance, and truth be told, shes having trouble trusting her instincts and men in general, but Hunter is patient, kind, and understanding, and Evangeline begins to find a bit of hope in her future.

I honestly wasn't sure going in if I would even like the story, since the backdrop of abuse in romance novels doesnt always win with me.  However, Evangeline, despite what shes been through and all shes wary of, has a noticeable inner strength.  And Hunter simply wears his heart on his sleeve, making it impossible not to love him.  Their relationship eventually grows into much more, but it starts as a simple, believable, and very necessary friendship, giving them time to know each other better before taking the next step.  And while its a fairly short read, its not the least bit lacking in character development or emotion.

After We Fall is an emotional story with a message of hope and healing.  Witnessing Evangeline come out of her shell and reclaim her life is really heartwarming, and the incredibly patient, romantic Hunter is just the icing on the cake.",An emotional story with a message of hope and healing,1463961600,,

A highland hellion raised by her brother, schooled not in traditional womanly arts but sword fighting, cussing and beer drinking. Disguised as a lad, Maggie fought at Culloden iand s imprisoned by the English in Fort Augustus. Fortunately her masquerade holds. She and we dread to think of her fate if her gender had been discovered! Maggie avoids detection by clinging to the shadows of her cell. That is all jeopardized when she's joined by another Scot, the injured Colin MacLean. Colin is painfully aware that he isnnow his clan's chieftain, his brothers having been slain during the battle before his very eyes. His  sorrow over their deaths rather than his runs deep. Nursed through a fever by his cell companion, Colin manages to escape the dreaded fortress and takes the lad with him. Only on the journey does he discover she's a lass. And what a lass! Feisty, spirited, unconventional. Colin is a successful smuggler, playing a game at first to tweak the English captain Abbot. Later it became a fully committed endeavour to help his clan and his country. Despite this, he doubts his abilities as a clan leader and is reluctant to return, but with Abbot having taken the keep and his people under English rule he must return. And here's where the pairing between Maggie and Colin becomes so perfect. This combination of determination and innocence that is Maggie is just the thing Colin needs to spur him on to take his place as Laird. Maggie's strength supports Colin in making his decisions. I love that Colin lets Maggie do what she is good at. He worries but he doesn't tie her down. Theirs is an unconventional relationship. But then are both far from the norm. They are very different from their peers. Each has doubts that the other helps conquer and as Colin knows down to his bones and Maggie has promised, Maggie is 'a fine warrior, and there wasn't anyone he wanted at his back more than Maggie Sinclair--Maggie MacLean.' They have each other's backs. Their unlikely enforced marriage gives Colin the  companion of his heart and Maggie the same. A love story from beginning to end.

Very well written and fast paced we meet Georgie Connelly who is rather embarrassingly, and reluctantly, undertaking community service after a misunderstanding. She is a documentary film maker which I thought was an original and interesting angle lending itself easily to the possibility of further stories. Georgie is short tempered and difficult but I immediately liked her. Beneath the prickly exterior is a warm hearted soul willing to go the extra mile to help the people she meets. She finds many, particularly social, situations awkward which made me feel empathy for her and Lindley portrays this rather flawed character, as well as all the others, skilfully and consistently throughout the book.

Georgie is already in trouble due to a previous documentary she has made about a white supremacist and despite her friends, Eric and Callie, arranging for an old friend, James Finn, to help protect her, this threat comes swiftly to a violent conclusion.

Georgie is meanwhile setting up her next project with a Russian gangster who is the head of a seedy underworld of drugs, prostitution and people trafficking, Maxim Petrov. Wanting to be portrayed as a successful and legitimate businessman Petrov is charming and personable but as Georgie works to expose him she realises too late the dangerous position she has put herself and those around her in.

Throughout the story James Finn struggles to look after Georgie and she gives him a hard time but there is an attraction growing between them which I couldn't help hoping would develop but Ill stop there not wanting to give anything away. The ending was perfect. This story was satisfactorily concluded, but plenty of scope was left for further stories to follow.

I wasn't too I pressed with the first few chapters and almost stopped reading. Which is very rare. I've discarded maybe three books in my entire reading life before reaching the end. Trust me, I've read some doozies. So, I persisted and I'm kinda glad that I did.

It was an interesting world with some interesting and creative races. I read this one and the next two all in one day.

Cons: some of the situations could have been fleshed out more, there seemed to be a lot of easy rescues going on.  The characters were a little one dimensional for me. Not much going on in character development seeing as the books cover quite a few years.

There was way too much sex. Not hot, sweaty, thrilling sex which would be good fantasy fodder - that would have been good. It was just boring sex, all the time. I started skipping over those bits.

SPOILERS: Everything was just a little too convenient. The battles didn't last long. There were no truly meaningful deaths. The characters who were supposed to be villains didn't do anything terribly evil before they changed their tunes and joined the good side.  Except for the main villain - he was quite horrible - yet his demise was quite disappointing.

Pros: I liked the authors imagination. Cool wavy coloured magic floating around. Interesting creatures.

Now Kassern that's a whole nother story LOL.  As the story progressed I got more and more into the background as to what was happening.  I started reading last night and finished while waiting for my car at the shop.  I must Say I really liked this book and the part about not being able to go to the safe house until Devyn confessed was the real twist and shocker.  But then again I also loved when all the Archangels were summonded and were giving the Hottest Baddest Archangel Kassern grief because of his indiscretion.  I can't wait for Summon Dorn.

Sure you may have read somewhere or have been told by a doctor or nutritionist  that you should get plenty of these foods in your diet.

What Mr David did was to take it to the next and much more important level. Kids have always asked (too many times) ""WHY""? It is a lot easier to do something you are told to do when you receive the answer to that all consuming question. He explains why these foods are not only good for you, but how they are and what they actually do that makes them so good. He really gets to the heart of the manual without having to write a 300+ word book.

Now I understand why these (very tasty: I love bulgur wheat salad with olive oil and lemon, called Tabboula) foods are so beneficial to my health and well-being. I am so glad that I was able to get the honor and opportunity to read this information.

OWNED can be read as a stand alone but for cohesion and plenty of back story, I recommend reading the series in order as many of the events of the current time line began in previous installments.

Told from four third party points of view (Simon, Margo, Nick and Lila) OWNED follows the two couples and their relationships that suffer, due mostly in part, to Simons ongoing issues with losing his voice, and his year long recovery that have left the other members of the band floundering in their professional lives. Although no one is at fault for Simons ruined vocal chords, Nick blames his lead singer for the destruction of the band. What ensues are two separate but entangled story lines where two couples struggle to reunite the band along with a lifelong friendship that has been destroyed by hurtful words and physical discord.

OWNED is the culmination of twelve installments including five full length stories and 7 novellas that focused on the relationships, friendships, successes and failures of the rock band Oblivion.  LOST IN OBLIVION is a series not only about rock musicians and the people they love, but a series about family-by blood and by association. The breakdown of a friendship all but destroys a once up and coming successful band- a friendship that has weathered many storms of personal and professional failure. The heartbreak and emotional fall out affects everyone involved but none more so than Nick Crandall who is unable to continue without his best friend-a friend he doesnt know is suffering from something much more than the loss of his voice.

Quinn and Elliott pull the reader behind the scenes  of  not one, not two but three relationships and how their downward spiral has a physical and emotional affect on friendships, family and personal relationships that struggle to move forward. All of the previous story line characters and couples play secondary and supporting roles; we are witness to expanding families, promises for the future, and the formation of a new band and another spin off series-Found in Oblivion. There is already a previous spin off series-HAMMERED-featuring a number of cross overs between both series.

OWNED is an emotional and poignant story line about friendship, family and love.  The premise is inspiring and heartwarming; the characters are spirited, provocative and intoxicating; the romances are seductive and erotic-there are numerous passionate and sensual $ex scenes throughout the story. Cari Quinn and Taryn Elliott have written an addicting series that I would recommend every time -who doesnt love a bad boy rocker that can be tamed by the woman he loves.",4.5 stars- a great final installment,1464480000,,

The supposed matchmaking going on between TJ and Aaron was nonexistant until almost the end and seemed rather irrelevant. As did the ""May"" incident. It was as if the author hadn't decided what it was until the end and randomly shoved it in. The ""may"" thing should have been introduced earlier on in the story so as to give real perspective between Aaron & TJ.

Theres gold is them thar hills!
  Jeanie Buchanan was sent down to Sun Valley to do an EIA- Environmental Impact Assessment by her boss George Chavez. His company Wilkes Environment Assessment Agency hired by Peterson and Snow.
  Ryan Hunt lived in Sun Valley. And while out in the woods, found Jeanie hurt after she had slipped and fell while looking the area over, and helped her back out and got help. Afterwards, Ryan showed her special areas that strange bears frequent. And around to where the elders, Val and Kyle were and then showed her how special the bears in the area where instead of explaining. And the real reason for the EIA.
  While trying to get to know the people and the reason behind the Peterson and Snow takeover, Peterson and Snow sent their Rep, Calvin, down to speed things along. Jeanie tried to get more help by asking her boss for the current mineral survey report of the area. To see about mining rights in the area. Being able to get both human and bear shifters together and sign an agreement that would keep the bears from losing their home and also pay off their land to the humans through the mining agreement.
  The wolves, Peterson and Snow, especially Peterson, was not happy. Demanding justice for the death of his son, Conrad. After the meeting broke up. The bear elders conferred and gave Peterson his right to justice in a fight. One warrior from each side.
  I really liked this story, it had everything. The two lovers Jeanie and Ryan. The continuing story to Sun Valley and the lead up to the end with a big justice fight. And in the beginning with the bears, I thought was funny. I was laughing. I just liked the whole book. Shes out taking photos, meets unusual bears. Then her accident and meeting Ryan and the rest.

He finds one of his sisters to be battling some sort of emotional distress.  The other sister seemed  know the cause but the whole family remained tight-lipped about whatever secrets they carried.

He didn't talk about his feelings of guilt nor does anyone else speak of theirs.  His father kept everyone at arms length as that  was what was proper.  The mother is self-centered and an absolute snob.  Her daughters were a disappointment to her.

I fell in love with her storytelling. I could see, vividly, the settings of New York City, railway travel, Denver, and mining towns of Colorado. I never could tell exactly when this story occurred, but I think it must be 1890s to 1900 or so. Electric lights, elevators, but obviously quite nineteenth century. The details of United States currency and the Secret Service tasked with fighting illegal coining and counterfeiting was fascinating. The two main characters were experts in their fields: one who detects counterfeiting (Mr. Emlyn Strickland) and one who is a master counterfeiter (Mr. Darrow (Dare) Gardiner).

The MM romance that develops is believable, real, and has serious conflict inherent in the story. After all, Strickland is the one who testified against Darrow and his testimony saw Darrow imprisoned in Sing Sing for a long six years and his sentence isn't up yet. But cooperating now with the agents in search of counterfeiters Darrow worked with just might result in a commuted sentence. We see Darrow's nature, his bone-deep code of conduct so well as the story unfolds. The romance develops slowly and is secondary to the plot. The conclusion to the story is one of the most rewarding I've read in a long while.

I love romances in which the characters are complete opposites, yet they feel a strong pull toward one another. I have to say this one is one of my all-time favorites. I must add that I love the names of her titlesthey perfectly reflect the story, and the name of the series is a true depiction to the books Ive read. The couples don't have an easy road to their HEA, but its worth the fight and struggle to get it!
I adored both Enzo and Jamie Lynn, but I wanted to be her BFF. She is such a spitfire. Life has knocked her down plenty of times, but she always gets back up. She should be bitter, but she isnt. I, like Enzo, wanted to absorb all her positive energy and gather strength from it. Shes tiny physically, but her personality is HUGE! Her inner energy puts you under her spellshe is a person you won't soon forget.
Now, for Enzo, hes Mr. Straight-Laced. He comes from a rich, privileged family. You would think he has everything he wants and his life is perfect. You would be wrong. He has everything he could want except his freedom from his overbearing family, and JL gives him that. Enzo wears suits and has the sexy nerd thing going for him. Jamie Lynn is tiny, tattooed, and changes her hair as often as the wind changes direction. Yeah, you would think these two wouldnt work, much less get along with each other. But, you would be greatly surprised. The two of them together just work!!!
The storyline is perfectly pacedthe romance isn't rushed, at least to me. All the characters are well-developed, even the secondary ones. Halston does a great job of including the characters from earlier novels which made me feel like I was visiting old friends. She does an incredible job of weaving those secondary characters into the book. She gives you just enough about the secondary characters which makes me salivate for the newest one in the series. Might there be a story about JLs brother, Travis, and JLs friend, Penny? I sure hope so.
I highly recommend this one and the whole series. It has a great story with angst and some twists, an emotional romance, and some pretty hot sex. What could be more perfect? Looking forward to the next one in the series.

Then stop your search and pick up a copy of Tamed By The Outlaw from new to me author Michelle Sharp. This story has a little bit of everything; romance, heat, drama, love and humor.  In a nutshell, it is the total package. The carefree cover is just the beginning!

Jessie Jameson is a romance author that specializes in scorching hot love scenes.  She is the Jesse James of the romance world and her legions of fans are completely devoted to  her bad-ass writing talent. Grayson Reynolds is the newly appointed CEO of the publishing house that has Jessie under contract.  They shared a scorching night together about a year ago, and due to miscommunication and purposeful avoidance afterward, their feelings never evolved. Now they are promoting Jessie's latest book together, which leads to another evening of amazing sex and the possibility of a relationship. However, Grayson's big plan for his company may derail any hope of a future together.

I truly enjoyed this book! I found Ms. Sharp's writing style to be lively and easy to read. The characters are well-developed, interesting and real. I felt the connection between Jessie and Grayson immediately, and cheered for them to work out their differences in order to become a couple. Lila Kent, Jessie's agent, is especially entertaining with her no-holds-barred personality and moxie. I can't wait for Ms. Sharp to write another book!

1908288,2,True,"08 27, 2017",ALYI8YM90TPD1,B00MIHTVDK,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Connie,"I first came across Breadner's writing in 'Postcards from Sturgis' where  the authors from Freak Circle Press have their MC characters meet at the famous annual biker gathering.  Although not generally a huge fan of  author mash-ups, since Susan Fanetti was involved I was interested.  Breadner's contribution to this experiment was interesting enough that I followed it up with her fan fiction 'Final Wisdom' based on Sons of Anarchy.  It was complete, gripping novel, very well done.  At this point, I figured her Red Rebels series would be a sure hit.  Sadly, 'Indulge' felt like more of a let down.

Other reviewers have mentioned the back an forth between present and past.  That can work if there is a purpose.  In this story it was just distracting, especially since the whole book happens over the course of a year.  The back and forth actually impedes the reading pleasure.  The book starts near the end of the story when Gertie has been kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and beaten.  Shortly into the novel, we have Buck forgiving her and declaring his undying love for her, which is ironic, because the ending leaves the reader hanging.

Gertie is a hard character to relate to.  There is a strong sense of poor little rich girl and a woman with many opportunities who makes bad decisions for a good chunk of her life.  At 33, she comes off as immature. She is estranged from her alcoholic mother and snobby brothers who were all jealous of her good relationship with her father as a 'Daddy's girl'.  Money is no issue as she has a great job and a wealthy parent.  We are told that Gertie has immense talent as a painter.  In college, one of her works was chosen to be part of a Warhol exhibit.  Strangely, our artist gives up painting when neither her mommy or daddy don't want to hang in art in their home.

Gertie is divorced, not because her husband was a cheater, but because she was too lazy to get off her butt to ever want to go out with him.  Rather than make an effort or tell him things she would like to do, she stayed at home for much of her marriage with  a book, encouraging him to go out on his own.  Hard to blame the guy when he finally meets someone more interesting. Even Gertie admits she was the problem.  "" And now she knew why Darryl had been so frustrated with her homebody tendencies.""

How does our little homebody handle the divorce?  She morphs into a party girl hanging out with girls a decade younger, going out, drinking, doing hard drugs and sleeping with strangers.  What?  Much of the book is about Gertie doing two things -- wondering if she is drinking and doing drugs too much and if she should tell Buck what she has done.  You know it's bad when the heroine makes the bikers look like a bunch of pikers with her carousing!

The dialogue was disconcerting.  Certainly, bikers don't have to talk as if they aren't intelligent, but the way the bikers and drug dealers talked in the novel often seemed artificial.  At one point we have Buck explaining that to his friends that she looked high because her pupils were huge as if bikers needed to know what high was.  Buck spends a lot of time thinking Gertie's drunkness is 'adorable' and that her tantrums are 'amusing'.  There is the biker who is scared of his mother and a young drug dealer, described as gangster who says, ""No harm.  No foul."" when Gertie turned down his sexual advances.  Bwahaahaa!  The same dealers use the old chestnut 'my bad' from two decades ago, in the form of 'our bad'.  Authors, like adults, should know that by the time a phrase gets mainstream, it is no longer cool.  Here's more gangster talk, ""Once you accept the proceeds of crime, we know you won't go running to the cops.""  How about this biker phrasing?  ""And if she did it for him that would feel like EVEN-STEVENS.""  What?  This is the same MC where one biker calls another 'bland'.

The characters say it best.

*Gertie bit her lip, sighing inwardly.  This was stupid.

* Emotionally she was a mess.

* That was really effing stupid.

* This is boring.  No point in talking about this.

* She rushed out of the room like a hysterial woman in a soap opera.  (Truer words were never spoken.)

* I hate when you talk to me like that.  I'm not a child.  I do stup1d sh1t, but I'm not a child.  (Methinks the lady doth protest too much.  This is apparently the 33 year old version of 'You're not the boss of me.')

* This might have been stupid to get involved in.

*She actually stomper her foot like a petulant teenager, her range of emotions all out of wack.

*""You didn't call me,"" she accused sounding stupid.  And she knew it.

Add to this the myriad of verb tense errors and this book became a week-long chore to get through.  It was as if the author got so dizzy from the past to the present that even verbs in th same sentence were of different tense.

I don't understand. Paige was an educated black women who before she reaches thirty is on track to be partner. PARTNER. But Paige was just so maddening. Instead of noticing all  her accomplishments. She was only worried about the bleach she wasn't married yet. We all have 5 or 10 year plans and they don't go according to plan. But Paige took that above and beyond. Although she wasn't easy not even a day after the news broke about her boyfriend having a fianc she was in a sex club. And her limits was no kissing. I mean really. Every two seconds throughout the entire book Paige was either yelling or sobbing. I cannot believe it. I honestly don't know how Paige can call herself an educated woman. There's no way she didn't know that she was pregnant. I mean being late is one thing. Being two weeks late is totally different. Especially when your on vacation.
Also Bobby although the oldest and the head of the firm had no backbone. Oh she doesn't want me. He sobbed out with tears. I mean come one. You've been watching her for two years(stalker much) and the minute she decided she doesn't want you you cry. And honestly he doesn't handle rejection well. Everytime Paige would change her mind and she did often he would either cry to his parents or his best frien Nathan. Also his jealousy was just too over the top. I loved the horse scene but one redeeming scenes doesn't make a book.
Also for the author this was 400 pages of a pile of poop. We spend 30 percent of Paige acting like a bitch. And then finally deciding she wants him and then tries to make up for it. 65 percent of this book is based on the vacation they took. I felt like it was only five days but too much imagination and not enough execution was the point.
Another big bet peeve of mine was the epilogue. Everything was perfect. They got there ending. And now to sell another book and have the reader buy the next book in the series. The author throws a wrench. And of this book this twist had nothing to do with this story at all. The kidnapping or killing of their kids are pointless. First because she was so vague in what actually happened. And the fact that the epilogue was barely 3 pages long. I mean I'm not satisfied with this book. And I'm not going to read the next one. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

For starters, it seemed like the author watched Mean Girls and thought, ""Huh, I think I'll write a book about an awkward girl who has never gone to real school, and who compares everything to things she has seen in the wild/in primitive cultures."" Theoretically, this could have been a good concept, but the execution was not there at all.

Tabitha was one of the most one-dimensional characters I have ever read. Her thoughts had one tone: superior. Even when she was supposedly happy and loving things, she just seemed so full of herself. She pretty much thought everyone was beneath her because she had been all over the world and understood the ""real world"" and assumed that American high school kids would be like what she had seen watching 90210. She was worried about other people judging her, but every thought she had was judgmental, even about her supposed best friend. Whenever she was supposedly crushing on Alex (that was his name right?), it never seemed sincere.

Speaking of what's his name, that was like the worst relationship ever. As soon as she gets a boyfriend, Tabitha went from ""how soon can I leave?"" to ""please, don't make me go!"" I don't believe the L word was never used, for which I am glad, because I give them a week tops before Alex realizes that she is absolutely crazy and dumps her. He seems like he could potentially be a decent guy, and he definitely deserves better than her.

Tabitha's whole family dynamic was awkward and terrible, and I am not going to tell you all the reasons it bothered me because it would take too long.

Anyway, I thought this book had an okay concept, but the whole thing was forced and just not good to me.",Just bad,1381363200,9,

Wouldn't read this book as a standalone but rather a sweet and further educational conclusion that filled whatever gaps and loose ends that the first book didn't.

Mainly told in the heroine POV with clever back and fourth between past and present. Hero POV's were few and far between but thoughtfully placed. Although I give this book the same star rating as the first, I did like the first one better purely due to it being a totally new concept of romance reading and was refreshing to be educated on issues I never had enough awareness about.

Tommy and Julie have been best friends since they were kids and she has always had a crush on him.  Tommy always thought of Julie as his best friend and in more of a sisterly kind of love.

Tommy was an MMA fighter and always seemed to lose Julie along the way due to his cockiness with his career and popularity.  He lost it all and wanted to work his way back up, but Julie feared that if he did, she would lose him all over again.

When Tommy finds himself in a situation where he needs Julie and it brings them even closer together, he realizes he feels things he didn't think he could feel.  Tommy had a bad childhood and never thought he could love anyone, at least the kind of love needed for a relationship.  When he sees things and I mean sees things that changes his mind, I love seeing him fight his feelings that he starts having for her.

I loved seeing Tommy fight his feelings and even though you can tell he wants her, he is so torn.  I loved how Julie stood by him all this time but I did just want to say give it up and move on.

When left alone he forgets an ingredient and the bread fails and Zebra helps him to understand it is good to ask for help when learning a new skill. This is an empowering lesson for young children that might be shy or afraid to ask for help. Reading about a character that the children like doing things that are difficult for them, gives them confidence to handle new situations and have a positive role model to follow. Just telling young children they can ask questions isn't as powerful as reading it in a book. At the end of the story Zebra tells Billy's mom that he was a good student, one of the best he has ever taught to bake. More positive praise for Billy learning to follow directions and ask questions when he didn't understand.

Books like this one with positive lessons are easy for teachers to use to help students learn lessons and modify behaviors in a positive manner. As a teacher, I would point out to the children I read to that Billy learned to follow directions and ask questions. Then in our next science experiment (we do at least one per week) I would point out that the children can ask questions and follow directions just like Billy in the book.

I really liked this one from the very beginning. Griffin was struggling with being an older player in the NHL, and a captain who hasn't been able to bring home the Cup in quite a few years. (Though of course, being from the city that's NEVER brought it home--except for the guy who plays for a different team--it was hard to be too sympathetic!) He had a lot of pressure on him, including rookies who were looking to him for guidance.

Chloe was struggling as well--starting up a new business, this time without her friends; dealing with her own poor body image issues and living under the shadow of the disaster that was her parents' marriage--it's amazing that she kept it together as long as she did. I was rooting for her from the first page.

Fake relationships can make for a really fun story, and this one is no exception. I especially enjoyed the celebrity boyfriend aspect of it--that definitely added a whole new layer to the troupe. The fact that Chloe knew nothing about hockey was just too funny--Griffin needed to be taken down a peg or two, and that did it nicely. I also loved all of Griffin's sports-related superstitions. They're only weird when they don't work, right? ;)

The one part--and admittedly, it was a pretty significant part of the plot--that I had a bit of an issue with was the idea that an ADA would use a celebrity's community service hours to help out her own sister. It took me a while to get past that--it just seemed a tad bit unethical. The deal eventually becomes public knowledge, though, and the resulting fallout and the characters' response definitely eased my mind.

Oh, and can I just say--absolutely adorable ending? Definitely sigh worthy!

Livvy is a girl with standards and morals, plus she likes commitment and would love a relationship, so when she meets gorgeous Tommy, the complete opposite of her, she soon discovers there is no way they can be together. Except love and lust doesn't work that way and she soon finds herself drawn to him, well what girl wouldn't, he's charming, fun and did I mention drop-dead gorgeous? But what Livvy doesn't find out until it's too late is that Tommy is no ordinary surfing dude out on the pull, he's the drummer in massive rock band Cold Fusion. By now her heart is starting to beat for him, but will she be able to keep this rock god interested and if so will she have to get a little bit crazy to snare him full time?

I really enjoyed Rock Me: Crazy. I'm not going to lie and say its beautifully written or full of sumptuous phrases that I re-read over and over, it's not, but what Rock Me: Crazy is, is exactly what it says on the tin! It's an erotic romance, with fun characters who are very easy to like, it's hot, seriously hot on a few occasions and it's a real page turner.

After going through a period of hitting delete several pages into books, Ms Quinn kept my attention right from the word go. Her `media res' beginning threw me straight into the action and kept me reading till the very last page. What this author also does, which is quite hard to achieve in this genre and keep it real, is have fun with her characters. Poor Livvy, she really did remind me of Bridget Jones a few times, some of the decisions she made and the things that happened were laugh out loud. Things didn't, however, get too ridiculous, just really damn funny. It takes a lot to make me really giggle when reading, but I certainly did on a few occasions.

I'll definitely be hunting out the other books in this series and I hope that these two characters pop up again and say hi. If you like rock stars as heroes in your erotic romance novels and a book that has a great flow of events to keep you interested, I really do recommend Rock Me: Crazy.

We have here another author who selects to give happy endings to those of the Bennet sisters not yet settled at the end of her previous book in this series of two, First Impressions. Kitty and Lydia have been sent away to a Mrs. Rivers' establishment to learn better manners and gain some education.

Darcy and Elizabeth decide now is the time to give Kitty a season. Lydia has her own ideas about how to gain precedence over Kitty in regards to finding a suitor and marrying. Then we also meet several young men, Sir James Stratton and Mr. Simon Brooks, who have decided this season would be the time for their own securing a young lady to be by their sides and to help manage their estates. They have been pushed in this direction by some determined relations.

Kitty becomes the main focus. While the young man who meets her by accident claims to have fallen in ""love at first sight"", she cannot believe he is anything but teasing due to her own lack of self esteem. He does not help his pursuit when he makes overtures which are perceived as forcing her hand. (After all anyone with a mother like Mrs. Bennet knows that as soon as that same mother learns a man is interested in a daughter's hand, that said mother will nag and complain until the daughter gives in and accepts his proposal.)

This is another sweet tale with no angst in my humble opinion. But if you like to read that Kitty finally gets some attention in the world of JAFF stories, you will definitely like this story. Part of what I did like was reading the opinions of certain aunts who seem to know or think they know their nephew well.",Kitty's story: more or less,1515715200,,

She's hoping to earn enough money to continue on her goal to go to Nashville, Tennessee.  Two men enter the cafe, one known as Charlie Prince who enthralls her with his beautiful blue eyes.

I recommend Entangle to those readers who like a sweet love story.  Lex Valentine is a reward winning writer whose writing is easy to read, concise and moves along at a comfortable speed.

Personally, and this in my bias, why are the lovers in most MM romances always handsome, over 6 foot tall, hung and successful.  The fantasy world is filled with gay men of this type.  If two guys of this description get together, why wouldn't they find each other attractive? Many readers of romance novels like fantasy and dream of finding and marrying the perfect man who fits the description above.  Not me! I am not perfect and I don't expect perfection in others.

The MM romance stories that have really touched my heart are those with characters who experience mental, physical or emotional challenges at some point in their lives.  Character develops as we accept ourselves and other's imperfections. It is a test of the love shared in the relationship. By learning to accept and balance our partner's strengths and challenges, love grows and the relationship becomes stronger.

It may sound like I am knocking this story. The author is merely writing what is believed to be what we want to read. I merely want to let good writers, like Lex Valentine, know what I would like to see in a more realistic MM romance novel.

Cam doesnt have a mother to love her unconditionally and tell her what a beautiful woman shes becoming, while Luc doesnt have a father to be proud of his achievements.

When Cam starts crashing at Lucs place, their chemistry ignites. Soon, they're having the hottest sex on the planet and taking extreme sports to another level entirelyexhibiting their sexy athleticism bent over the counter, in an outdoor pool, and up against a wall

Because theyve been best friends for like forever, they assume they know what each other is thinking and feeling. But until Luc can overcome his insecurities and Cam can figure out how she really feels about him and how shes going to do life when everything starts to fall apart around her, they cant move forward and get where they need to betogether.

Finally we get to see where life takes Kellan and Kiera, our crazy couple who we love and hate.  Well, I think we all love Kellan and hate Kiera, but we might just hate her because she has Kellan and well, we live in reality.

The story picks up where Effortless left off.  Kellan and Kiera are madly in love and the D-Bags are on the brink of hitting it big.

As we all know, fame and fortune isn't all it's cracked up to be and sometimes it comes with a price.  People will try to take advantage of your situation for their own motives and unfortunately, our D-Bags and their lead singer are their newest targets.

All sorts of people come out of the woodwork to take advantage of the hype that is surrounding the D-Bags as they are about to explode.

""Well, if I've learned anything in this business, it's that you either roll with the punches, or your simply roll over.  And I'm not rolling over for anyone.""

Kellan never wanted the fame and fortune.  He just loves to make music.  But he puts up with it all because the other guys in the band don't have anything else to fall back on.  He sacrifices things for his band brothers because they sacrificed so much for him when they were still trying to make it big.

""It takes a special person to be able to handle all of the attention he'll receive.  Are you sure you're that woman?""

Kiera, of course hates the attention.  She hated the attention Kellan got when he was just playing at Pete's.  Now he was on his way to rock super stardom and the attention he would receive would be unparalleled.  Could she handle throngs of wannabe groupies throwing themselves at him where ever he went?

Trust has always been a big issue in their relationship, considering how they started out.  Could she trust him to be faithful?  Could he trust her to stick by him no matter what?  Would this all become too big for them to handle?  Sure it was one thing to be in love without the whole world knowing, but could their relationship last all the scrutiny?  Would Kiera stick it out with Kellan though the good and bad or would she run back to Seattle where things were normal and easier?

This leads me to the story.  The story is good.  Really good.  I was shocked at how long and thick it was (insert ""That's What She Said"" joke)!  But that didn't matter because I couldn't put the darn thing down!

You will fall in love with the characters and their development.  Some of them grow so much from when we first met them in Thoughtless and some, not so much.  You'll be loving them, hating them, wanting to smack them and wanting them to push you up against a wall.  You'll have these feelings within pages of each other.  It's almost exhausting, but so worth it.

S.C. Stephens did not disappoint her faithful fans in this last installment of the Thoughtless series.  I'm sad that it's over, but I'm ok with how it ended.  And I think everyone will be too.",Love Love Love!,1362441600,4,
701670,4,False,"06 10, 2015",A2KBHSK5BS35BH,B00KUQIU7O,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},Leeanna Chetsko,"UPROOTEDS description likens the book to a Grimm fairy tale, and thats a comparison Id agree with. The scariest thing in the book isn't a particular bad guy, but an entire forest: the Wood. Its malevolent and corruptive, and if you venture inside, you won't come out the same.

Agnieszka lives on the edge of the Wood. Her valley is protected by the Dragon, a great wizard who demands a girl every ten years to serve in his Tower as payment. Everyone expects that Kasia, beautiful and talented Kasia whos prepared all her life for this indenture, will be taken. Agnieszkas devastated about it, because Kasias her best friend. But when she herself is chosen, everything Agnieszka knows changes.

UPROOTED has an Eastern European folk tale feel, and since so many fantasies are set in pseudo-Western European countries, I appreciated that. I also liked how different types of magic were presented. Agnieszkas chosen because she has magical ability, but when the Dragon tries to teach her his spells, they don't work and tire her. Why? Because her magic is intuitive; she feels her way through spells rather than commands them.

I really liked the Wood in UPROOTED. Its delightfully creepy, and I liked how the author slowly revealed information about it. The Wood was my favorite part of the book; I especially liked the ultimate reveal about its creation. Agnieszkas stubbornness also endeared her to me, because I felt her attitude and reactions to events were quite realistic (and probably ones Id have myself).

UPROOTED did have a couple of downsides for me. At times, I thought the pace was really slow, and my attention would wander while reading. I also wasn't a fan of the relationship that develops between Agnieszka and the Dragon. Thankfully the romance isn't in your face, but I just didn't see why they were attracted to each other. Lastly, I wanted more character development for the Dragon and Kasia. A lot of development was put into the Wood; I wish even a bit of that had been given to the Dragon and Kasia, since they are important characters.

As far as I can tell, UPROOTED is a standalone, and I did like the way it ended. Its always nice to get a complete story in a book, rather than have to wait 2-3 years or more. But at the same time, I wouldnt mind a return to this world.",Uprooted,1433894400,,

I was 30% in before the author gives a clue to her history and why she acts the way she does, it frustrated me, I guess. On the positive side, I loved Tori's snarkiness and her business model of free love advice with each cup of coffee sold. The visual of bikers surrounding her cabin buying cookies and soliciting advice was hilarious!  Rain is a wonderful alpha male but I got tired of the ""your my woman and my purpose in life is to take care of you"" mantra. I never saw the ending coming. The bad guy was not on my radar. I suspected Rain's sister-in-law, so he would die without heirs, except her husband, and she could profit from Rain's wealth. Sounded plausible to me...  Overall, I felt like I walked into an ongoing situation with very little background on the problems between Bantorus & Lagsturns MC.

I won't get into the story line as much as the writing itself. I LOVE her writing style. There was not even a second of the flow and/or story being too slow, too rushed, too boring, or too ridiculous. There were also no issues with sentence structure (and that is a pet peeve of mine having to correct poor sentence structure or verbiage). Character development was awesome, and the romance extremely well done. Many times I like the H much more than the h (and for some reason h's are not written as well as the H) but I loved them both equally. And the siblings? Just as awesome (and how much cuter could Bitsy get?!).

Over-all I would recommend this author to anyone and everyone. The only thing that might not be someone's cup of tea was that it was borderline YA, but just barely. The maturity level of everyone was such that you never realized how young they were. Oh, and another thing that I loved was that conflict was not over-drawn, over- the-top, or unrealistic. It was there, it was dealt with, and people moved on. No excess drama.

Review from Jeannie Zelos book reviews

Genre: Romance

My first Sarah Morgan book was the wonderful Christmas Ever After, so I was really looking forward to this story. Sarah is a prolific author, though a new one for me, and I was hoping this would have that magic thread of drama and HEA that I so loved in Christmas...sadly though it was afun story, full of real characters and problems, and a bit of heat it just didn't hit the spot for a great read for me. Still, thats how it goes,what one readers enjoys doesnt work for another.

I enjoyed the characters here, but they did feel a little in the box stereo-typed. Eva the incurable romantic, Frankie, who didn't believe in romance at all, and then Paige. Paige was very ill as a child/teen and thus her family and Jake have always been overprotective of her. She wants Jake, has loved him for years yet he won't make a move, even when she gave him an open chance when she was 18....Jake wants her he says, and yet hes been happy enough to while away his time with endless models, quick flings,one month wonders at the most,and doesnt exactly pine after her. I didn't really feel any chemistry between them for a long while, and that kind of let it down for me. In Christmas I could feel that sizzle even though they both were sort of at each others throats, but here Jake treats Paige like a little sister, snarking and arguing with her each time they meet, and I didn't get the sense their was unfinished business between them, that they really wanted each other badly.
 The story plays out well, the events they plan sounded great and I enjoyed all the descriptions of them, but the romance well, it was a bit too pat for me, a bit too sweet and lacked anyreal drama. Even when there was a downside it didn't last long.

If you like a sweet romance,an even paced andrelatively gentle onewith a HEA youll love this, but it lacked the drama for me to lift it from a good read to a great one.

I really enjoy the supernatural and mystery aspects of these books, and it is all set in brilliant counterpoint to the lovely relationship between Gideon and Lee. Their relationship is portrayed so simply and honestly, with so many little everyday details that make me smile. It's not without bumps, but their bond is strong enough that you know they'll survive anything.

My one qualm with this book, is that despite the fact that Gideon has shown again and again that he loves and trusts Lee and respects his gift, Lee wasn't entirely and completely open with him regarding his gift and his anxieties about it. Throughout the series Lee has always been a bit more of a closed book, both because we don't really get his POV, and because he's the one with the clairvoyant powers, not Gideon. I'd love to see Lee open up more to Gideon, considering the love and trust between them.

Still, great update, and some lovely sexy scenes as well. :D",4.5 rounded down,1490313600,,

I really do get tired of a strong, intelligent heroine who falls in love and basically changes all her feisty ways to become a lady.  This one doesn't.  At age 13, Winnifred is shipped off to a farm in Scotland by the wife of her guardian.  She is accompanied by her not much older governess.  They are left there for 12 years with little money and no servants.  Survival was hard but they planted a garden, did sewing, and raised a few animals.  Then the new marquess discovers their existence for the first time and sends his younger brother to retrieve them.  Lord Gideon arrives to tell them of their good fortune but is attacked by them instead when they mistakenly take him for a thief.  ""Freddy"" is not enthusiastic at all to learn that they are to travel to London, but agrees for the sake of her friend/governess Lilly.

The characters are all extremely well done.  Freddy is everything that I look for in a heroine.  I love that she does not lose her strong independent ways and refuses to settle for less than she really wants.  Gideon's sense of honor endeared him to me.  Meeting the two women and understanding what they had gone through because of his larcenous stepmother, he wanted to do everything he could to make things right.  I also felt sorry for him because of the PTSD he suffered from the loss of his young shipmates.  It did start to annoy me, though, when he kept refusing to consider marriage to Freddy because of it.  I found it a little hard to see how it related to marriage, but I do know that mental problems do not always make for rational thinking.  The witty dialogue between Freddy and Gideon kept me smiling through much of the book.  Freddy was such a character!  I also enjoyed the secondary romance of Lilly and Gideon's brother and, lest I forget...Claire the goat was a charmer.

Detective Shifter Britton Townsend was punished by SPAC, the agency that overseas all shifters rules and regulations, and has to live 20 years as a human. However, as fate would have it, they have to give him his shifter powers back in order to solve a crime. Agent Val Calhoun is set as his partner but they have always seen each other as enemies, that is, until he becomes a shifter again.
The idea of finding a predestined mate in PNR may seem too obvious for some but it's if played correctly it's extremely romantic for me. And the author does a terrifically great job here. The way each other realize how much they care for each other. And the fact they can't even kiss, that raises the tension a thousand percent! So many mountains to climb to get to their HEA!

Perhaps a better way to put it is that If Only is a drama filled book. Sometimes this can be a good thing, and sometimes it can be bad. Here it was a little of both.

Despite the books synopsis I don't think its too spoilery to say that Jordan and Noah are the main couple were supposed to be rooting for. A lot of the time I totally shipped Jordan and Noah together, but there were also times when I wasn't sure if I liked Noah or if he deserved Jordan. Noah has a misplaced sense of loyalty, and he clings to his past rather than taking a chance on the girl he has real feelings for. He jumps to conclusions and judges Jordan rather unfairly. Despite all this, when Noah has a good moment, its a very good moment. And it becomes more complicated, because hes not afraid to own up to his mistakes and try to make things right.

What I loved about the book was seeing Jordan experiencing new things, traveling and making new friends. I adored Jordan's roommate, Elaina, and Duncan was another great secondary character. For background characters I found them to be well developed. Despite my minor issues with the book, A.J. Pine definitely has talent for making her readers feel something for her characters.

Heart of a Duke Series Book Six
Edmund Deering, the 5th Marquess of Rutland would seem to have no redeeming qualities at all. He lives a dark life in his dark clubs. And he lives for revenge. His next target for destruction should have been an easy one, only he wasn't prepared for Phoebe Barrett.

Phoebe Barrett had dreams of love and marriage. Unbelievable since her father's horrid reputation had her on the bad side of the ton. Being a victim of the tons gossip, she refused to listen to anything about the marquess. She saw the man inside that no one else did. Or was he just that good at pretending while he went after what he wanted?

Both Phoebe and Edmund had negatives when it came to their parents but each took a different road in life. Edmund has been mentioned in the other books as well. Another great book in this series.

Any book that starts out with a ironic sexy gandalf who ends up in a case of mistaken identity and makes out with the wrong twin gets my unconditional love just because of reasons. And I dare you to challenge that logic.

Suffice it to say, Truth or Beard -the first book in Penny Reid's new Winston Brothers Series- is pure chick-flick gold. Its hilarious, makes you swoon, leaves you with a severe case of 'Fernweh' and also...BEARDS! Beards are very important at the moment.

This was my very first read involving the Winston Brothers. I'm slowly but surely making my way through the Knitting in the City Series, which already featured the boys, but I'm not that far yet. Fortunately it doesn't matter. There really are no open questions and this series can very well be read as a standalone.

Let's talk story!

All her life Jessica James had two obsessions. Travel the world and Beau Winston. Exploring the world is not that much of a problem. In fact, she has a plan. Newly finished with college Jessica is back in Green Valley, Tennessee, working as a math teacher to earn enough to pay off student loans and after that escape her hometown. The second obsession - Beau Winston is a bit more tricky. Especially when said twelve year long crush is cut short by a case of mistaken identity and a scorching hot make out session with his twin brother Duane Winston.

Who would have thought after knowing them her whole life she couldn't tell one twin from the other? Add to that her life long frenemies status with the sexy mechanic and things could quite possibly get interesting.

I guess I don't have to tell you how amazing both these main characters are, right? It's Penny Reid book. The heroine is smart, somewhat quirky and knows what she wants. The hero is good looking, patient, a straight shooter and a bit of an adrenaline junky. Also...BEARD!

I absolutely adored Duane and Jess's relationship and history. 'Enemies' to lovers is such a great romance trope, mostly because of the built in chemistry and conflict. Let me tell you, those two know how to work with their connection. And once they figure out what they want *cough*each other*cough* it gets so cute and adorable and bananas and coconuts and revved engines and wanderlust and read the book....

MVP - Cletus Winston. Seriously, there were times when I thought he might just be my favourite part about the whole book. Mind you, that's quite a challenge when you consider that this book and everyone in it is just damn near perfect. Cletus Winston, mark that name. I think he will become one of my all time favourite book boyfriends once he gets his own book in the hopefully near future.

Every character in this book is so darn lovable and I really adored how Ms. Reid managed to balance such a large range of characters. Starting with all the brothers, town people, family, friends and the designated bad guys - the local biker club. Well done on the world building front, without losing sight of the romance. Makes you hungry for more.

2. Write thank you notes.
3. Take a hostess gift when you go to someone's house for the first time.
4. Don't get married if you don't know anything about the person.

You would think #4 should be a no brainer. But alas and alak...it is not. And that is basis of our story.

Katia is trying to make ends meet. She has a job she likes except for the s*** boss, she is taking care of her wheelchair bound mom and she occasionally gets laid. Her mom took care of her as a single mom her entire life. She owes her everything. Not exactly living the dream...but she is okay as long as her mom is okay.

Marcus is a sexy guy who sweeps her off her feet. Katia knows he is not a boy scout.

""He's smooth, he's sexy and he knows what to say. He's the true meaning of the word player.""

Marcus is not an open book. He has a secrets and doesn't even pretend to be open with Katia. He has his own reasons for wanting to move quickly with Katia. But can he keep his feelings buried with Katia like he has with everyone else in his life. She's different.

And even though she doesn't know what she means to me, or what she doesn't mean to me, I know that I'm the right choice for her.
At least that what she thinks.

Marcus is one focused, self-serving SOB. He manipulates, lies, and doesn't apologize for it. How long can he keep that up?

""This isn't meant to happen. It's not, because I'm Marcus Tandem. And I'm falling in love with my wife.""

As a reviewer, that makes my job really hard. Really, really hard. Readers see a a three star book and assume the worst, but by assuming not only do they christen the world an ass; they have the potential of missing out on something pretty spectactular. Stripped was a good book, but lately ""good"" has somehow become synonymous with ""bad"".

Flow with me here; my three star rating means absolutely one thing. It. Was. Good. The reason or reasons behind my three stars may be the very thing that draws you to a book. Google the word ""good"", and if you're still confused about my rating, you are beyond help. I think Stripped was a very well written book, and Jasinda Wilder has unquestionably earned her way onto my instant approval list. I will continue to read anything she writes; anything. I also think there's a large audience out there that is totally going to love this book, but a few of my personal preferences kept me in ""like"" with Stripped, not in love.

I'm a very tough nut to crack when it comes to insta-anything. I totally have an STD! Sexual Tension Disorder. Love at first sight and quick romance just isn't my thing. It's extremely hard to pull it off because I'm usually the one left not understanding the feelings.

I loved Dawson...LOVED!! He fell for Grey hard and fast. His persitence was perfectly endearing, but I didn't understand it.

Why?

Probably because I thought Grey was completely insane; totally stripping her way around the cray cray pole. It did create drama, and intesnity, and I guess I sort of understood her ""outbursts"" and irrationability, but it was too much. As much as it pains me to say, I didn't like Grey.

That being said, Dawson's devotion to her in spite of all the crazy made me love him even more, but it also pulled me away from the story. He possessed an unconditional devotion of someone in love, but why? I just couldn't buy someone tolerating so much push and pull, so much eye widening drama. My heart just couldn't accept that there was enough time between Dawson and Grey causing feelings to develop that were deep enough to elicit that kind of devotion. I didn't undertsand the love; I didn't feel it. Damn my cynical heart!!

None of this was Jasinda Wilder's fault because many, many readers love the idea of soul mates, but as a reader without feeling what they feel, it's hard for me to, well...feel.

The premise of this story was fantastic and the plot, entertaining, but without me being invested in the relationship I couldn't love it.

Alexander is really impressed by this as he knows for a fact that even now Oliver still doesn't open up fully to him.

After discovering that Oliver has musical talents Alexia mentions that as a way to help Oliver that Alexander should help set up a meeting with a record producer to see what they think about Oliver's talents. At first Alexander isn't sure but after a few moments he realises that this could be a good thing and organises it for the next day. The meeting goes quite well and even Alexia sings with Oliver, Alexander couldn't be happier that Alexia suggested that he set this up for Oliver.

The next day is Alexia's birthday and even though Alexander is still asleep she can't stay in bed any longer, however even though she thinks that her day will be spectacular now that she is with Alexander she is wrong about that. With a knock at the door Alexia is surprised to see some flowers waiting at the gate and as she runs to get them as there is no one there she ends up being knocked out and kidnapped.

After the amount of abuse that Alexia receives she is in so much pain but then she gets a real shock when she discovers that she's carrying Alexander's child. Knowing that her child is inside her is the only thing that is keeping her sane but will she be able to escape in time to help protect her child or will it be too late.

What I enjoyed from the read....

""Promiscuous Christmas"" was indeed a sweet cute short contemporary romance that took place around the Christmas season for Annie and Jack. Wow, be prepared because there was some steamy hot sex scenes that really added to this delightful fun romantic read. I liked how the author presented the point of view from the heroine and hero in how they arrived at their decision along with some good secondary characters that added quite a punch in this captivating entertaining read.",Good Read!,1419897600,,

When her relationship of 3 years is suddenly and unexpectedly over, Thea heads back to Magnolia Bay for some much needed down time. She certainly does not expect her neighbour to be Calder...the motorcycle ""bad boy"" every girl in high school lusted over. Or that she can still feel regret over a kiss that never happened, that he is hotter than ever, and she still tingles when she's near him. Thea is coming away from a break up though, and is still working through her feelings for her ex. Calder is only in town for a brief period, for work and family obligations...then he'll be gone again, right? Thea has never listened to her heart though...maybe it's time she did.

Pick Me is a fast paced novella that packs a lot into it without overloading the reader. Erika made me feel like I really got to know Thea (as much as she drove me a bit crazy at times!), the feelings, doubts, and insecurities she has all add a very real touch to her character. Calder has come a long way from his ""bad boy"" image, but he still rides that motorcycle and thanks to Erika I can totally see him on it in my mind! Great imagery!! He is dealing with family issues while back in Magnolia Bay, and those issues actually help to bring Thea and Calder closer, even if he didn't want to involve her. Erika manages to let us look at the whole package of Erika and Calder in Pick Me, and she blends it all together very well. Their characters are strong, and in this brief novella the character growth is enough to make your heart happy for Thea and Calder.

I loved the integration of Calder's family as a sub plot in Pick Me. Erika manages to make it completely relevant to the story line and uses it to draw us in even farther. I also liked seeing Thea's relationship with her sisters.

Well paced, Pick Me is all about following your heart. I'd recommend it to any romance reader looking for a very well written novella!",Pick Me!,1404345600,,

I am one of John Meffords advanced readers. Although I received a free copy prior to publication, I bought my own as soon as it became available. Why? Because I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

AT Dusk, the fifth of John Meffords Alex Troutt series, is another must read book. Like all the others in this series, it is very readable by itself. I highly recommend getting the earlier books because you will find it so much more satisfying if read in conjunction with the others in this series. Alex Troutt is a kick ass female FBI agent. She is as tenacious as a wolverine, while still maintaining a strong sense of humor and a surprisingly soft side as a single mother.

This episode in Alex Troutts life reminds me of an episode of Criminal Minds.  it's more like watching a movie or tv show and not just reading a book.

John quickly develop his characters. Even casual characters are more than cardboard cutouts. He deftly weaves his tale, presenting situations and locations so real, you find yourself immersed in the storyline, caring about the characters as if you know them personally.

Generosity oozed out of every pore in Jesus' body. He gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, attention to the outcast, cleansing to the leper, food for the hungry, and even new life to the dead.

And in one final Act of Generosity that trumps all others, He gave Himself completely in death so that mankind could be restored and freed from the curse of sin.""

In the present culture, generosity seems to be linked only to the Christmas spirit, but is rarely thought about the other eleven months of the year. Yet generosity is talked about as a signpost for the early Christian church. It was said in the New Testament that the early believers were known for their love for each other. Their generosity radiated out of Jerusalem to the spreading communities of Christ's followers. From there it spread on to non-believers and was one way the new Christians were known.

As a culture, we've all but forgotten how to be generous. The emphasis on self help, self improvement, self aggrandizement is rampant and has to some extent curbed incidences of generosity with growing emphasis of distrust, whether one deserves the generosity given or not. That is one reason I find this book such a refreshing draught in a desert of self emphasis. Among these stories are incidences where generosity was completely unearned, unsought and unexpected--given to the individual or family telling the tale.

Many of the stories were reflections on such a case of generosity that it inspired the teller to live by its example. Some individuals began spreading generosity around quietly while others created ministries of giving. These are not stories of people crowing about their own achievements or worth. So many are tales of joy, meant to bless the reader with inspiration and hope. Human kindness is not dead yet.

One of my favorite stories was about a person who obeyed the impulse to purchase someone's groceries while she was waiting in line. She recognized the person as one who had come to her church asking for some financial help. What made the incident special for me was the writer's reflections about this later. The person she saw in the store hadn't made a very good impression on her. In spite of that, she felt compelled to demonstrate generosity anyway. Her conclusion was about obedience. God doesn't ask us to judge whether a person is worthy of our generosity. He just asks us to obey Him when He prods us to action. It reminded me of a conversation I had decades ago with a loving godly woman; we were discussing the term ""used."" Her point to me was that in the world, the term means to be taken advantage of or despoiled somehow. But in God's eyes, to be ""used"" is a blessing. It's our choice how we view being used. That short conversation changed my point of view and from that moment on I was determined to be obedient to God's prompts.

I hope you will take the time to read this little book. Many of the stories are endearing, motivational, and heart-warming.

This is the second book in the series and the second book I have read by Caroline Fardig.  The more I read the Java Jive mysteries the more I enjoy Caroline Fardig books.  I like the way that although she deals with dark subjects such as murder she always injects her books with a lot of humour making her books a light and easy read that are thoroughly enjoyable.  This is an author that will be added to my favourites list and I can't wait for the next installment of the Java Jive mysteries.

Although this book is about murder it is fun!  Juliet, the heroine is surrounded by a lot of quirky, fun characters.

Peter her friend from school, her boss and the person that she has unrequited feelings for is arrested for the murder of his girlfriend.  Juliet doesn't believe he could do something like that  and so begins a high octane, fast paced, humourous adventure to find the culprit.  There are so many candidates, including the victim's very dysfunctional family that I found myself loving every minute of the investigation, chuckling at all the events and twists and turns that unfold.  In fact this author reminds me so much of Janet Evanovich books which I thoroughly enjoy and read as soon as they are published.

Seth had lost his wife, and did not want to loose his daughter, Faith who was living with his wife's parents. He was a 'famous' country and western singer, but had stopped singing, causing financial issues.

We first start out with Seth rushing to get to the airport, when he sees and stops at a car accident.  Although he doesn't want to miss his flight, he decides to stay and help.  Leaving a necklace with the girl in the car, so she can get it back to him.

We them jump a little further, after he looses his car, with him at the airport in the worse storm Nashville had ever seen, all flights cancelled!  He is desperate to get back to his daughter, but the weather has other ideas!  We also meet Trista and her daughter Savannah, who has left her boyfriend, but they are stuck at the airport too. and we meet Frank, who also needs to get home.  Frank gets the last rental car and overhears Seth losing his patience as there are no cases left.  Frank offers Seth a ride.

So they journey begins, with Seth being grateful but still feels everything is against him.  the weather is getting worse, but they continue, after a while they come across a broken down vehicle, although Seth wants to leave it, Frank convinces him to offer they occupants a ride, its Trista and Savannah, mother and daughter.

We learn all about each of the characters stories, all desperate too get back to Fort Wayne, but all leaving something behind in Nashville.

The journey is not without hitches,  They happen onto as wedding in a place called Cupid.  Seth's attitude begins to change he let's himself begin to hope! Trista's past catches up with them, but crisis is averted! Frank is this as wise as ever!

They eventually make it home, Frank gets back to his wife, Seth makes the court appearance, still doubting himself, and Trista goes back to her mom.  But she surprisingly turns up to support Seth at Court.

AJ and Hayden separately are compelling. Together... I have never seen so many messes that left me lost - because each one has his reasons! The supporting was also good. Some m/m treats women in particular like a name and a dismissive attitude are enough. Not here. They're not all fleshed out, but the important ones are, lending Evergreen Grove a nice three-dimensional sense. (I suppose, had I read any of the series, that would be even more evident.)

It has been a long while since Ive felt so thoroughly connected to a set of characters as I have been with Just Silvia Cotton and the Dickinson brothers.  After Forever Ends traces the love story of two souls who share lifes journey in a way that is so authentic and powerful that it left me in tears and in stitches, often simultaneously throughout the book.  There were no climatic, edge-of-your-seat sort of moments, but instead the author carefully wove the beautiful tapestry of Silvias life with such grace and purpose that I can almost imagine that she is real.  I grew as she grew.  I felt what she felt.  I learned about the moving and sometimes painful truths that only time can teach as she experienced them.  There were so many carefully written segments and one of my favorite came toward the end of the novel as Silvia began the process of reflecting on her life, something that each of us will do in our own time.

I could not have asked for better friends or a better life, but theres a nasty trick about living.  It happens at its own pace and in its own way and you never, never know whats coming next.  So you keep running and running to keep up with it and most people get tired.  Others don't get tired.  They just get overtaken by the road And before I knew it, all of us were old.

He uses women & then kicks them right out of his bed, but then we see the flip side of the coin that just once he would like a woman to make it a little tougher on him, give him something to chase, but these bimbos are mostly married or engaged & are just looking for a quick romp too. But when Tristan met Leah all those years ago she made him wait, she bantered with him & made him crave her company, not just her body. Once they finally got down to business & had the most fantastic night of their lives, big misunderstandings occurred. In Leah's mind, it sealed Tristan's fate as a permanent douchebag loser. And that is why in book #1 we find his brother Dre, his girlfriend Kathryn, and Leah all teaming up with a terrible plan that totally throws Tristan under the bus. It saves their youngest sister Piper but yet it was totally unfair to Tristan. Dre & Kathryn's wedding day approaches and that is why Tristan & Leah suddenly find themselves in the same city relieving their old misunderstandings. Tristan's father is completely heinous, to all three of his kids, so much so that they've shut him out of their lives. But the one advantage is they decide to finally bond together. Once Tristan gets out from under his father's influence he seems to make a complete change in his life - not really believable but ok. Can't really go from douchebag deluxe to suddenly being a philanthropist helping out all of Dre's friends! There are many interesting side parts to their story, like Leah's mom's battle with cancer & how she may be affected. Luckily it makes her live her life to the fullest & take advantage of this new opportunity with Tristan to start fresh & establish a real relationship with him!

While we found the book's content useful, although a little bit repetitious in parts, and it more or less delivered on its promise, we were somewhat surprised by the large number of typos and errors - especially in a book on writing, and especially in such a short book.

Sadly, of late, we've come across a number of people who are teaching others how to write and publish books for Kindle, and they almost all chant the same mantra - don't worry about spelling and grammar, just put your book out there.

Ultimately, we believe this is going to give self-publishing a bad name (if it doesn't already have one), and may even lead Amazon to tighten up its submission policies, and while we accept that not everybody has the resources of a major publishing house at their disposal, we think authors owe it to their readers to at least subject their books to a reasonable level of proofreading first.

Our novel, which is approximately 112,000 words long, was proofread by ourselves, and by a couple of friends, and we'd be surprised if there are anything like the number of errors in that book as there are in the book being reviewed here.  It's really not that hard to do, and while it may take some additional time, we believe that presentation is important.

Having said that, this book is easily worth the $0.99 being asked, it's an easy and quick read, and we will probably try a couple of Rick Frazier's other books too.

We would have given it 4 stars, but had to knock one star off for the bad English.

I have slightly mixed feelings about this book, but my overall feeling is a strong ""awesome"". I'd give the first half approximately four hundred stars, and the second half 4 stars.

Premise: Annie, a librarian, is the new one-day-a-week librarian/resources person at a local prison. There she meets super-duper-hot prison Eric Collier, who writes extremely sexy love letters to her on the sly. Sometimes she watches him take off his shirt and do pushups. They have a forbidden, no-touching sexual fantasy thing going on for a while, but then Eric's circumstances change, and things suddenly get all too real.

The first half of this, where Annie meets Eric Collier in prison, and he woos her through forbidden tiny flirtations and hot looks and then secret love letters, is so well-written and so, so sexy. I didn't know that what I longed to read was a forbidden-love epistolary romance between a bad-boy prisoner and a librarian with a past that makes her wary of bad boys, but dear heaven, I did. And it was great. It was so great the second half seemed less good by comparison - even though the second half is better than 99% of all romances.

Cara McKenna is an excellent writer - and I am stingy in handing out that compliment. Her prose is outstanding, her insights ring true, the sex scenes are often very human, very real, and not the same six interactions we've all read about a million times. McKenna also seems interested in exploring the intersection of masculinity and blue-collar America and the modern economy, which is something she does achingly well (frankly, I think part of why I had a harder time with the second half than the first half is that the prison seems a relatively hopeful place, compared to the future possible in a dying rustbelt town to a man with criminal record.) And how often do you read a romance novel and think ""This person is really saying interesting things about the role of masculinity in modern-day America?""

Like I've said, the second half was not as wonderful as the first half. But it's still very good, and I loved the book as a whole.",The first half of this book is the sultriest thing ever.,1397692800,,

No change here except that this is Regency mystery.  There is some romance but there is more solving of the whodunit than there is development of the romance, although I didn't feel cheated in the least.  There's enough romance here to suit me and the two main characters are quite likeable.

The very good thing about this story is that it is Book One of a new series Rasley calls Regency CSI.  I'm looking forward to reading more of these stories in which hero Sir Matthew Holt, former ship's physician, and Russian emigre heroine Lady Natasha Danford will collaborate to solve mysteries.  Matt and Natasha have known each other for many years but have never been close.  They are family because Natasha's late husband and Matt's late wife were twins.  Matt was lifelong friend of the twins and, for some reason, he and Natasha never quite clicked although she is aunt to his two children and he uncle to her son.  In the eight years since the untimely illness and deaths of their spouses, they haven't grown closer.

Yet Matt is who Natasha reaches out to for help when she is stranded at Brighton Inn.  Prinny is about to celebrate his birthday with a big bash at his pavilion in Brighton, but on the way to the fete Natasha runs into difficulties and Matt, who lives nearby, comes to help her out.  But it's a dark and stormy night, there's the murder of a mysterious foreigner, the inn is filled with many peers on the way to Prinny's birthday celebration and with employees of the inn and people of various walks of life  All this adds up to an interesting mystery with many suspects, including Natasha.  Matt takes on the autopsy and investigation of the case, all in the hopes of clearing Natasha's name.

Matt and Natasha work well together, bouncing ideas around.  It's not clear who did the crime and it turns out that several people could have been motivated to do it.  And there's the Russian connection which seems to incriminate Natasha and turns out to be crucial to solving the case.  Things get mysterious-er and mysterious-er.  Natasha and Matt get to understand each other better.  The reader gets to enjoy both a good mystery and a romance.  (Can the romance lead to something serious?  Stay tuned.

Simone is an ordinary mom of two boys and a loving wife who happens to also hear voices.  Some taunt her, others are having normal conversations that she merely overhears.  She's sure she's crazy, but her loving husband doesn't react as though it's true.

Then one day, Simone is visited by an angel and is told something she fears more than going crazy: she's sane.  The voices are those of creatures in other dimensions, layered over-top of one another which creates a tapestry that fits perfectly together.  All by That Which Is.

While this is a novel with deep-seated spiritual ideas and concepts, it isn't preachy at all.  The author focuses on an idea of oneness and love, not on religion where a person has to perform certain tasks or take on a certain role.  It shows and pushes unconditional love.

There is much I love about this novel, but there were also a few things that brought this down a star for me.  The main issue was the overabundance of characters.  With a novel about an epic battle between good and evil, there were a few characters killed along the way.  Unfortunately, so many names were brought into the novel, characters in and out of the main focus, that I couldn't mourn any of them (save for one, a real heart-breaker near the end).

Another issue is that this novel could have easily been longer and more immersive if certain scenes had been expanded.  For instance, there is a summary of ""others"" and legends introducing themselves to the world.  There is very little concrete description of these creatures or what they said or how the audience at these introductions reacted.  At least one or two should have have been shown in full-scene, providing the audience to feel the awe of the situation.

Aside from those two issues, this novel was pure pleasure.  Below are some of my favorite lines:

His green eyes burned like emerald fire against the dark canvass of his skin.

[An angel to Simone]  ""My ability to intercede with man is limited.  Can you build a tunnel for the ants?  Even with all your strength and knowledge?""

Perhaps, but I found both the lead characters so compelling and impactful that I could not help but take their side against all comers. The story was well plotted, throughout all the novellas, and the dialogue and characterizations stayed consistent throughout. The sex? I would say also constant and consistent, however passionate.

This way you get a better understanding of the characters and what has been going on since the beginning.  I will post the reading order at the end of my review to help you know the order.

What can I say about this book but wow you amazed me with this book.  I wasn't sure if you would ever be able to get me to like Kyle after everything he has done to hurt and manipulate the people around him.  It's been two years since his last match that ended with him confined to a wheelchair.  Things have changed and so has Kyle.  He's gotten the use of his legs back and now he wants to show his sister that he isn't the same person that he use to be.  To gain her forgiveness he has to first apologize and try and make amends with her friends.  Who just so happen to be some of the people he hurt the most.

Megan didn't know Kyle before his accident and his decision to change.  The only thing she knew about him are the stories she heard and none of them painted him in a good light.  In the past Megan was violently abused by her boyfriend and survived it due to help from her friends.

Megan vowed to stay away from dangerous guys but Kyle draws her in and she can see the change in him.  Things won't be easy between these two.  Her friends aren't gonna understand and won't like that she's dating him.  Especially due to what has happened in the past to her.  Her friends aren't going to be the only problem though.

Will Megan and Kyle's relationship be able to survive her friends?  Can Kyle earn his sisters forgiveness?  What about the other people he's hurt...will they be able to forgive him or is it to late and to much damage?  The other problem will test their relationship in many ways.  To see exactly what this is gonna do to them and how it will affect them then you have no choice but to pick up this book and read it to find out.  I promise you won't be disappointed in the trip it takes you on.

L.P. I'm sad to see these guys go and will miss them.  I take comfort in knowing that I can revisit them anytime I want by picking up my kindle and selecting the book to reread.  I look forward to seeing what you have for us next.  Congrats on another great series and I'm glad that you ended it with Kyle.

Blurb:
Alina Leone is in hiding.

Her parents are dead, her best friend is a horse, and she cant return to her home planet of Gliese until the Shadows, the monsters who hunt for her, are found and destroyed.

But they found her first. The same creatures that murdered her parents and forced her to flee to Earth all of those years ago. And theyll stop at nothing to destroy the only thing standing in their way for universal domination--Alina.

She must find the strength to defeat them, even if it means choosing between victory and the one she was meant to save.

Summary:
Alina was a wonderful character who always tried to do the best she could in in spite of needing to keep the secret that she and her guardian Peter were from a different world. Alina had no memories of her parents or the world she came from. Needing to frequently move to keep themselves safe left Alina alone until she met Kate and Nightingale, her horse. One of her abilities was that Alina could talk to Nightingale who looked upon Alina more like her child. As Alina was about to become an adult in her world her abilities began to manifest leading helping James, a wolf, sent by her people to protect and bring her home before the shadows find her. Unfortunately, the shadows arrived too soon, but between quick thinking by Alina and help from nearby people allowed them to make a quick getaway. Alina found herself in a new world with people from her world looking to her to save them and she has no idea of what to do.  Add to that: an enemy vowing to kill her, fleeting memories, one young man (Ander) who took an immediate dislike for Alina, and powers that Alina has to release to save her people giving you a story that held me spellbound until the very end. And that is just the beginning of Alina's story!

It was fascinating experiencing Alina's struggle to find her place from a scared young woman finding not only her place, but a love that may just stand the test of time. The growing feelings between Alina and Ander was even more fascinating when Alina's past memories started to reveal a shared past that could change everything between them.

While I enjoyed this story, it seemed to end abruptly leaving the reader wondering if Alina's powers were strong enough to help all the people and worlds that were almost destroyed by the shadows. That would have helped round off the plot, but even with that I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great story.",Great Story!,1470873600,,

This was a quick read that showed a unique spin on the blood rose story.  What happens when you resist the mastyr vampire call but are confronted with your blood rose?

Yolen and Brianna have been dating for a while and she has been putting up with a lot.  Yolen (to ""protect"" Brianna from his work targeting her) has rules.  Lots of rules. They can only be together Friday nights.  They can only talk to confirm the dates that week.  I wouldn't have put up with this nonsense as long as Brianna did, but I guess love makes you do stupid things.  Brianna was on the edge of breaking up with Yolen when she suddenly finds herself drawn to another mastyr vampire and wants him to take her blood.

Obviously, this doesn't go over so well with Yolen.  He's been fighting the urge to ""level up"" to mastyr vampire for a while now but it's getting that much harder to resist.

Lovers of young adult science fiction/fantasy novels should not miss Shock Me by Ashley C. Harris, the first installment in the series with the same name. Harris beautifully creates her own unique world where people with special abilities live amongst the rest of the population. While reading Shock Me, I couldn't help but think of the TV show Heroes.

High school student Donna Young is not part of the popular crowd and hopes winning the a spot on the state gymnastics team will allow her dreams to come true--to leave the town of East Applegate. But, when Donna survives an accident that should have killed her, it turns her world upside down and exposes her incredible special abilities. Unsure of whom to trust, Donna works hard to keep her abilities a secret while at the same time trying to figure out exactly which abilities she has and if she can control them. Completely captivated by Donna's character, I couldn't but fall in love with her because despite not knowing what she is turning into, she accepts that she is now different from everyone else. Ryan Applegate, the most popular student in school, harbors a secret crush on Donna. But, Ryan never acts upon his feeling because he has undisclosed information that would hurt Donna. Ryan is a difficult character to gauge because you are not sure if he is a good or a bad guy. Future installments of this series, I have no doubt, will answer the lingering questions about Ryan's character. Although the reader can see the potential for a romance between Ryan and Donna as the chemistry between them sizzles, Shock Me is not that book.

Harris does a brilliant job of adding depth and developing secondary characters, Randy, Rebecca, and Spencer, who will be integral to future stories in this series. Also, the author is masterful at developing her original plot with plenty of surprising twists that keeps the pages turning.

Memorable characters and plot momentum will keep the reader fully engaged right up to the pulse-pounding, dramatic conclusion with a stunning ending that I didn't see coming! Shock Me is a gripping beginning to a new series. I, for one, look forward to the future adventures of these characters.

I received an eBook copy of the book for the purpose of an honest review. I was not compensated for this review, and all conclusions are my own responsibility.","Pulse-Pounding, Dramatic Conclusion!",1382918400,,

The second book in Zoe Dawson's Going to the Dogs series, this one tells the story of Brooke, her dog Roscoe, and Drew. While Roscoe wasn't as central as Max was in the previous book, he still played a central role in the book. This book had more sex than it's predecessor, Leashed, but nothing raunchy. Brooke, a dog salon owner, is kind-hearted and giving. She thrives when helping others and is all give and no take, caring more for everyone else than she does for herself. While she's a strong woman, she fears abandonment. Drew is the lawyer sicked on her by a disgruntled, irrational, overly self-important customer with an equally irritating (and vicious) dog. His main task is to get her to settle out of court. Drew's plan goes completely awry, however, when he starts to fall for Brooke. One thing I have loved so far about this series is the closeness of Brooke's group of friends. The books have put a lot of emphasis on relationships, whether those be friendly, familial, or romantic. I find Poe in particular hilarious and cannot wait to read her story next in Hounded. This book absolutely has a HEA ending with no cliffhanger.","Excellent book, excellent series! :)",1460160000,,

I both laughed and bawled like a big baby though this whole book, and sometimes I even did both at the same time. I can totally relate to how hard it would be to up and move to the opposite side of the world, leaving everyone and everything you knew behind. So while I knew they both had very valid reasons for not wanting to make the move, it tore my heart out watching these two people who were in love, have to say their heart-wrenching final goodbyes. Cub giving up Tess to Charlotte....let's just say there were many, many tears shed on that part of the story. But then in a way, it wasn't really such a surprise, especially after the way Cub was able to zero in on Charlotte and noticing the pain that still linguring in her eyes, the very first day they met.

I love the fact that we were able to learn more about the rescue center in Kenya, and it's inner-workings. Takes very special people with heart of gold to sacrifice their own lives, in order to give these precious kids a better life. I was so happy that we got to revisit with Rachel and Logan, I just wished we could have gotten to re-visit Paige, Cody, and little Ryan, too. I also thought we'd get to see more of Mia and Dee-Dee on this trip then we did, but hopfully we'll get to see more of all these characters in upcoming books. Maybe in the next family vacation trip to Myrtle Beach, maybe? The one character that really has me curious about, though, is Evan. I think he has a lot of hidden secrets of his own to tell.

I'll try to sit back and wait patiently for the next installment in ths series, but it won't be easy...that's for sure!","An outstanding book filled with the message of love, forgiveness, Mercy and Grace.",1461801600,,

This story starts off so slow that I caught my attention drifting...I was daydreaming while reading!  I put this story down several times...something I never do.  What little action there is...well, it drags and characters are slow to connect with.  I kept waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen.  By chapter 10, I was still waiting.

We have two, young movie celebrities...Francesca Leon and Calder Fox.  Calder is a reformed douche and recovering drug addict.  He's a sober/recovering alcoholic with a mess of emotional issues.  He's trying to mend his ways from being a renowned manwhore of Hollywood...trying to salvage his reputation in the movie industry because nobody will hire him.  He's a real hottie and is perfectly aware of his attraction to women and fans and he knows how to work it.  He battles with survivors remorse, guilt and depression among other things.  But he can also be kind and considerate.  He's very sweet and understanding.

Francesca (Frankie) Leon is simply stunning, with her long dark hair and hazel green eyes.  She's the type that takes relationships seriously....she must feel emotionally connected to someone before she acts or pursues someone, or allows them to pursue her.  She doesn't jump easily or randomly.  She's dedicated to her work...she's kind and compassionate.

By chapter 17 this story began to grow on me a little bit even though it was moving at a snails pace.  And don't misunderstand, I like a growing romance.  But this one just wouldn't take off.  I eventually perked up a little when I read that Calder and Francesco had to pretend to ""like"" each other for publicity purposes while maintaining  their distance --- they had to make it believable that they were a couple to dredge up publicity for the movie they were both starring in.  I thought ""finally...this is going somewhere...it's going to pick up the pace"".  But... I simply never connected to either of these two characters.  It was too little, too late.  Their interest in each other wasn't believable.  Their attraction wasn't believable.  I liked that Calder experienced so many ""firsts"".  First time to really get to know a woman before trying to jump her --- first time to appreciate a relationship or even have one --- first time being committed to anything (people/friends, movie set) ----first time being celibate, etc.  As much as I liked him, his feelings of unworthiness and self loathing and thinking he was undeserving of anything overshadowed the plot.

This story was predictable.  A guy with a massive ego and issues doesn't want an emotional relationship, yet begins to feel more than he bargained for and faces getting hurt and relapsing (fall off the wagon).  On the ""up side"", I liked that there wasn't the usual misunderstandings or false assumptions between the two main characters...they were both open with their questions to each other.  If any confusion or wrong ideas from the paparazzi would begin to arise, they'd talk it out openly.  But the drama was mild and not very interesting.  The conflict wasn't much either....more built up to be a problem that what was actually problematic.  Ms. Grace made lots of silly written mistakes that weren't edited out, like; ""...he brushed my hair away from my house""...???!!?!?  It took me 4 days to read this story...that never happens with me.  Not with a story of this short length.",Disappointing and predictable...,1477440000,,

The character development was slightly lacking and I hope they will get better in the next books.

The process was known as `blackbirding', and most of the workers were effectively slaves.  The methods of blackbirding varied: while some labourers were apparently willing to be taken to Australia for work, many were tricked and others were kidnapped.

This novel is set in during that period in colonial Queensland and Kiri is a beautiful young victim of blackbirding destined for slavery until she is rescued by Ben Luk.  Ben is half Chinese and is himself a victim of the racial prejudice which seems endemic within the colony.  Ben has plans to make his fortune in Brisbane, using wealth obtained from the Palmer River goldfields.  Unfortunately, Ben makes enemies while defending Kiri and those enemies seem determined to destroy everything Ben has worked for.

This work of historical fiction incorporates a love story within a much broader story about a period of Australian history which is probably not as well-known as it should be.  Each of the characters and many of the situations encountered illustrate particular facets of late nineteenth century colonial life - the good, the bad and the ugly are each covered.  There are some truly unlikeable characters in this novel and they sometimes meet with marvellously appropriate (if occasionally fortuitous) outcomes.

This was David Crookes's first novel, and I am looking forward to reading his other books.

In the previous volume, Callie was leaving the boarding house to meet Jack at the MGM studio.  Her landlady caught her sneaking out and made sure that she wasn't moving out without paying the rent. Then she gave Callie a biscuit to eat on the way.

After a long trolley ride, Callie was barely able to think because of all the wishes in the minds of the other passengers.  As a fairy, she really wanted to grant these wishes.  But the Seelie would then detect her presence.

When she got off outside the studio, the clamor of wishes was even worse.  She followed the crowd to a side gate.  On the way, she gave a nickel to a bum with a sign saying that he is a vet.  The bum recognized her and tried to follow her into the studio.

She ran into the gate and almost knocked down Jack.  She told him about the bum.  Then he showed her how to sign in.

In this novel, Calliope LeRoux was a teenager living in a hotel within Slow Run, Kansas.  Callie was beginning to hear voices in her head.  Then she left Kansas to go to California to find her parents.

Donchail LeRoux DeMinnit is Callie's father.  He is a full-blooded Unseelie Faery and was the heir to the Midnight Throne.  He abdicated the position and now Callie is the heir.

Margaret LeRoux is Callie's mother.  She is human, but is married to Donchail.

Jacob Hollander is a teenage hobo.  Jack comes from a bootlegging family.  He is fleeing feelings of guilt over the death of his sister Hannah.  He helps Callie get to California.

In this story, Callie and her parents rode a street car out of Culver City.  She didn't remember much about the ride to downtown Los Angeles.  Her father sat with his arm around her mother the whole way,

When they leave the street car, Donchail yells that they had done it and kisses Margaret.  Then he bows to Jack and Callie and thanks them for the escape.  Margaret suggests that it is a little early to be celebrating in public.

Donchail leads them around the back of the street car shelter and whistle up a cleansing and new clothes.  Then they go to get something to eat.  Afterward, they discuss their next move.

They decide to go to New York City.  Callie opens a gate and walks through it.  The betwixt and between is gray and filled with Unseelies.  Callie realizes that it is a trap.

Callie struggles to remain near the gate, but cannot find anything to cling to.  Margaret wishes really hard for the gate to open.  Donchail and Jack also wish for the opening.  Callie shriek and shoot back through the gate.

Now Callie is afraid to open gates.  They discuss other ways of getting to NYC.  Donchail will not do well on a train, but he decides to ride the rails despite his reaction to iron.  They head for the train station.

This tale causes Callie to help humans trapped in a fake Hooverville.  Her fairy sight shows the huts to be growing from the limbs of a tree.  When she is trapped by the tree, Jack leads humans to attack it.

A Halfer accuses Callie of killing the tree, a friend of his.  He spreads the word among the Halfers about the incident.  Then Callie is saved from an Unseelie by another Halfer.

Halfers are separate from the humans and fairies.  This is the last volume in the sequence.  While waiting for the next work by the author, you might want to read her prior volumes, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fool-s-War/dp/0446602930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fool's War</a>.

When reading this book I can say that if I was a woman struggling with my sexuality that this book is definitely something that would help. Our one main character Jamie is in Paris trying to make her way Internationally with her company. She works in I.T. and isn't having the best time in gaining clients or a sale. Then one day Jamie meets Giselle. Giselle helps Jamie with her dress outfits and learning how to talk to the French and what points to market and how to truly be effective. These two start spending a lot of time together getting to know one another and before long become best friends. One day Giselle tells Jamie her biggest secret...that she's not into men, but rather women. This throws Jamie a little, but doesn't really put any type of rift in their friendship. But through time and different relationships that Jamie comes into contact with she starts to realize a few things. She's never really had a boyfriend and sometimes the thought of women wasn't always the purest.

Once this is the mind track Jamie is going down the book kind of takes an interesting turn. Misconceptions are made along with misunderstandings. Feelings are brought up and questioned. Life choices are questioned? And then the question becomes will Jamie realize her true feelings before it's too late? Will she find a happy ending? Is it the one she wants? Could she finally have what she's been searching for and never really knew it? There are a few questions that one has while reading this book and while it was a quick read, it was the perfect introduction in the F/F world and what one could expect from this type of book.

This book follows Adam and Penn and Jared and Fenix, you should read Dance and Mask before reading this book. I just cant say enough about this series, I love it so much. There is so much depth and feelings with this characters you feel like you are right there in the story. I loved Jared and Fenix in Dance, but I have a soft spot for Adam and Penn from Mask. I love all of these men. Adam and Penn have been living together almost a year but things aren't going so well. Penn is bored and Adam cant get his creative juices flowing. Jared and Fenix are now in Sweden and invite them to spend the holidays with them. Everything isn't perfect with Jared and Fenix either. The two couples spend the holidays together and it was an amazing story. You found out what was going on and how things were resolved. I honestly loved this book and didn't want it to end. I hope there is another book soon, I cant wait to see what happens next with these couples.

It starts out with Elliot, which I thought was a man, but turns out isn't, driving to Miami to start a new job as an Econ teacher at a private high school. She's running from something that has brought a lot of unwanted attention to her family. We get bits and pieces of what happened throughout the entire book. That's what kept me from putting this book down for long. I wanted, no, I needed to know exactly what it was the Elle (she changed her name when she left NYC to help her hide from her past) did that had her running. We are given bits and pieces throughout the story. That's what kept me reading... that and Luke.

What's not to like about Luke. He is absolutely perfect (OK, there was one thing that caused an issue for Elle, but I forgive him). He's sexy, romantic, talented, great with the kids, and totally attracted to Elle. Although his life hasn't been perfect, he's dealing with things the best he can.

And then there's Aria, Elle's sister, who we hear from as emails at the beginning of the chapters. She's still in high school and has to live with her mother. She's still in NYC dealing with all the things that Elle ran away from.  Her emails are really great insights into what she is, and what Elle had been, going through. I hope to find out more about her in upcoming books.

Middle Aged Miss Stafford finds an un-posted postcard in a book and her maid accidentally mails it. This sets off a chain of events, the first is her decision to go and board with a family out of curiosity to meet the young lady who wrote the postcard, and find out if the young man (a doctor just beginning his career) it was written to will appear.

The story is cute and moves along at a fair clip. But it is not, like others of Isabella Alden's, a truly Christian story. There are a few mentions of God and the Bible that seem ""stuck in"" and could just as well be taken out again - God is in no way central to the characters or their lives. I even found myself disliking the family in the first few chapters because the daughters are so uncharitable and ungracious in their feelings towards both Miss Strafford and the young doctor, who are unexpectedly present on Christmas.

Later, the book describes these same daughters as gracious and kind, but it rang kind of false. Anyway, it's a light read and fun for an evening if you're looking for that. But, if you're looking for a story about Christian people learning to live according to Christian principles and God's will, keep looking.

The two young teenagers were walking to Elizabeth's house from swimming at an apartment complex when a gang of six young men attacked, raped, tortured, humiliated, and finally murdered the young girls who had such promise. Jennifer was an only child and Elizabeth was back on track after hanging out with the wrong crowd. Jennifer was still a virgin when it happened and she had planned to remain a virgin until her wedding night. Sadly, Jennifer and Elizabeth would never live that long until that June night in 1993 when they encountered true evil. The writer does an excellent job in researching and writing about the case. The six boys, one was only 14 years old would receive 40 years in prison while the other five would be sentenced to death. The author explains each of the boy's circumstances and backgrounds which help understand. Peter Canu was the ringleader who was obviously raised by a delusional mother who believed her son could do no wrong when he was obviously trouble since he attacked teachers, principals, security guards, and threatened to kill the principal as well. He was obviously a dangerous to others long before that June night. His mother was completely enabling him by continuing to defend him. She had no idea of how truly dangerous that can be with a monster in the form of her own son. Then there was Sean O'Brien who was abandoned by his father before birth and his mother would later leave him in the care of his grandmother who loved him until an accident rendered her incapable. He would move back to live with his mother who was a stranger to him. In the end of his life, O'Brien showed some emotion regarding his part in the crimes of the killing two girls and well as possibly Patricia Lopez. The writer does an excellent job in showing the parents of the victims' pain and horror during this emotional experiences, there are still four more executions to go.

I know that Keely was 19 and it had been 5 yrs since he had been home but didn't sound like he was that much older than she was, plus they made a point of talking about her maturity at the age of 14 and u wouldn't expect maturity level to lessen, rather u would expect it to age appropriately with life experience. (ok, I know I am putting much too much thought into a book of this caliber). The writing was ok, the angst was certainly there but what I didn't like about this book to warrant the low rating was the foul language. I have nothing against the occasional F-bomb or the GD word or even milder cuss words used a little more frequently but the F-word was their go-to expression. It is more appropriate I guess with the mano a mano male friendship scene but this was ridiculous. The author should make more use out of the grammatical pause... or maybe get a thesaurus or something but this was just too much. In one scene they are confronted by someone from their past and she starts cussing at them (and really foul cussing at that) and they take umbrage with her language in front of the baby but their language (mostly his) is no better.

I can honestly say I have never read a book like this before. Defiance is a Distopia/biker romance all mixed together and it worked. Though I have to say the writing style took a lot to get used to once I did I enjoyed it. This book if filled with twists and turns and a lot of mystery all through the book some things are left out but I believe thats just because this is a new series. I'm excited to see who book two will be about because their are so many options of interesting characters that I will be happy no matter who the next book in the series is about. I love the new trend of authors moving away from series with multiple book about the same main characters, and giving us great world building through different characters in each book and I'm so glad that I've found another series that like this. Another thing that I love when done correctly is books written in both the hero and heroines point of view and I can easily say Stephanie Tyler knows how to write from a mans point of view, normally I hate when other point of views are thrown in but in this book it works(though it doesn't hurt that the character with the other point of view is so interesting).

When the Chaos hit( a chain reaction of natural disasters) the world as we knew it changed and the people changed right along with it. Now back on Defiance ground Tru is being forced to bond with Roan Silas's(her ex) brother but Tru knows the only man she will ever bond with is Caspar. Caspar grew up the bastard son of Defiance's leader and he has has to fight for any and all respect and he has it. He is Defiance's enforcer and he is not only feared but respected and one people listen to. When he see's Tru is back and she wants him to claim her he knows he can't let her go this time. But some in Chaos aren't happy Tru is back and hidden truths she holds from the past could be devastating to some. Now Caspar has to protect Tru not only from people on the outside but people in Defiance as well. Caspar has held a lot back and left a lot hidden till now and he plans on making the wrongs right. While he and Tru set about making changes in Defiance people from Tru's life outside of Defiance want revenge and the people who should want the best for Defiance may actually be looking out for themselves.

  This is one of the hardest books to write a review for because there is just so much going on in this book there are so many twists and turns the minute you think you have it figured out then more is added and then there's another facet to the story that shifts it all completely. To explain it all I spoil the crap out of this book because that's the only way to explain it all. From beginning to end this book if cocked full of deception, secrets, pain, rivalry, hidden agendas, backstabbing, and love and when it's all put together it works so well and creates a great story. This is a book that you have to pay close attention to so that you don't miss something important. I'm excited to not only see who book two is about  but to see where Tru and Capsar go from her as well as see how characters from this book continue to grow and  move forward.",An Interestingly confusing book,1370995200,3,

I will say that the book is written in an easy to understand fashion.  It has many good points to be made in the respect of thinking positively about yourself and your life.  I also appreciate the author's desire to break us of the habit of seeing ourselves as victims or as the party that has always been hurt.

I do a lot of counseling in the realm of Pastoral work and so many times people believe they have been victims or everything is the other persons fault, it is never their fault.  Stop that thinking right now and Steve Norton hits that nail on the head.

So, why only three stars if I agree with much of what he says in the first part of the book?  Well, I didn't like his hype at the beginning of the book.  He has found the answer!  He knows the truth!  He has read everything and put it all together and come up with the solution!  That sounds more like a self-help salesman than someone who wants to help us change our lives.  I don't think he is technically that type of person, but it left me with that feel.

I also did not agree with the approach of simple self inflicted bad responses to our bad habits.  He talks about using a rubber band to twang yourself when you have bad thoughts or when you remember bad habits that hurt your life.

I guess I am more a fan of the power of positive thinking.  I turn to scriptural responses to help people see the terrible consequences of their ""victimization"" or their comment, ""It's the other persons fault and issue not mine.""

I believe that Nortons technique will work for some, but I am not a fan of it overall.

Overall there are many good points that Norton makes in the book.  So, read it with an open mind, but also read it with an honest question of how this will work for you.  In the mean time, you are not the victim.  You own your life and the happiness or pain in it.",Techniques for changing your behaviors and habits,1386028800,,

I liked the main characters, private practice attorney Cassie Blaire and corporate lawyer Brad Steele as individuals, but not so much as a couple. Both are independent, career driven people with some baggage that ends up being the catalyst to their future together.

Cassie is a widow and has not been in a relationship since her controlling husband passed away. She never wants to experience that type of togetherness ever again, where her dreams and ideas are prohibited. Although she is a fair and sometimes ruthless lawyer, she has a submissive side in the bedroom that has never been explored.

Brad is a step away from making partner in his New York City law firm and as a result, he works constantly.  Due to his father's philandering, he has a warped sense of relationships and love.  He dates, but no woman has ever rocked his boat, that is until he meets Cassie in a bar in Vail, Colorado. At this point, Cassie and Brad have no idea that they will be working together on an uncontested divorce.

Cassie and Brad hook up and experience the best sex of their lives, unmasked.  No names or identifiers, just pure dream fulfilling lust. I found Cassie and Brad's time together a little disturbing because Cassie lets Brad take control of her pleasure, without even getting to know him. Although Brad is a dom-wannabe, he has his act together and knows what he is doing instinctively.  However, as time goes on, his emotions play havoc in his mind and he goes a little to far.

Brad's alpha side is extremely hot and sexy. Ms. St. Claire can really create steamy scenes and leave the reader panting. I am a true believer in love at first sight, however, Cassie and Brad's relationship evolved a little too quickly, to the point where I thought it became almost unbelievable.  The book is well-written and I would have enjoyed a little more story in lieu of sex. Overall, a solid read and I look forward to reading more from Ms. St. Claire.",3.5 Stars!,1393200000,,

 Leah Koopman finds herself waking up after celebrating her 18th birthday to the most horrible dream.  She remembers a fire, an explosion, her best friend being incinerated along with a lot of others.  Surely this can't be true, but then she looks down and finds herself covered in soot and realizes that her nightmare is real.  She takes off running, suddenly realizing that everything has changed.  She notices that she can now see things she that couldn't see before.  All of her senses are heightened.  She  has strength and speed that she can't explain.  She also has an insatiable thirst burning her throat, and finds herself craving human blood.  Not knowing who to trust, Leah runs, and when a group of beautiful immortals try to help her, she doesn't quite trust them, but then finds herself being chased by something even more dangerous, the Brotherhood, who want nothing more than to see her dead.  As she travels with her new immortal friends, she finds herself immediately drawn to Max Machiavelli.  He is absolutely beautiful and Leah can't stay away from him.  Max feels the same way about Leah.  She joins his coven in Amsterdam and learns much about her family and her past.  Leah desperately wants to find a way to avoid continuing to kill humans to survive.  After being captured, she meets, Adam, a human and a member of the Brotherhood, who also has the same vision.  Can they work together and come to an agreement between the immortals and the brotherhood, or will everyone end up dead in the process?

This was an interesting book.  The immortals in the story don't claim to be vampires, but they do live off human blood, though they don't share all the common traits with your typical vampire.  This was a different and interesting concept.  Leah is very powerful, and destined to be the leader to bring the different covens together again.  She is also very opposed to the killing of humans.  Being raised as a human for the first 18 years of her life, she has an aversion to the slaughter of humans, even if only done for survival.  It was kind of hard to get a grasp on exactly what was going on in the beginning of the book, but once it was made clearer what was happening, the story progressed at a fast pace.  Max and Leah are mates, and there is quite a bit of hot romance between them.  Max loves Leah dearly and would do anything for her.  He is quite the hottie himself.  Adam, the human, was a very nice guy and helped Leah out a lot.  She cared about him a great deal.  Several other members of the different covens were also interesting to get to know.  The setting and locations in the story were all beautiful, and the progression of the story is interesting and keeps your attention.

Wow. This story. This story. First of all let me say that the scene between Christopher and Jesse in Jesse's office that starts off with them kissing with the fake pearl necklace between them? H-O-T. Seriously. The whole scene made me hard and hot. But then again there were a LOT of really hot scenes in this book, interspersed between a magnificent plot that while it had a number of editing mistakes, we're not enough to throw me out of the story. The setting was magically described, not just by the characters' awareness of their surroundings or giving a basic layout, but the setting was developed to the point where every place, and even inanimate objects held a memory, an emotion, a deep emotive power that resonated not only within the characters but within the reader as well. The same can be said for the characters. For while not every gay/bi man's story is the same, there is a air of familiarity within these characters. The desire to be able to let go, be one's true self, to love again after tragedy, to live one's truth, to love someone in spite of the adversity you may face, to long for a significant other even if it costs you relationships you thought were essential to your happiness, to stand up for oneself or someone else, and most importantly the desire to be seen by someone, anyone, who finds us worthy enough to want us to be a part of their family. The biggest issue(s) I had with this book could be greed on my part, although it sort of stuck in my craw for a bit: 1)What happened with Marcy? We know what DIDN'T happen, but inevitably, what occurred? It seemed like such a big buildup only to sort of stall out. 2)-here comes my greed- What happened with Gareth? He turned his attitude and personality around and really redeemed himself. He deserves a HEA.

What do you do when after seeing something you were never supposed to see your perspective of someone changes completely? That's exactly what happens for Zach when he catches his step-sister Sylvia in a compromising position.

Sylvia is suspicious of her step-brother Zach's change in attitude, he's acting strange or at least she thinks he is. How did she not notice before how much of a sexy man he'd grown into, wait is it wrong for her to find her step-brother hot? Torn between what society says is right and the growing passion inside her she finds herself turned on by his actions and unable to resist his new tactics. How far will she let it go?
If possible book 2 is even hotter than book1. Now on the same page and seeing each other in new light Zach and Sylvia must figure out how far they will take this. There parents are away so there's no risk of getting caught right?

After no one comes in Zach's curiosity gets the best of him and he goes to find out who disturbed their night, can he get rid of their guest and continue with his plans to corrupt his innocent little sister?

Wild passions by Kate Douglas

4.5 stars

Feral Passions is run by hot sexy werewolf shifters.  Some have been lucky and found their forever mate but some are still searching.

This was a sexy, funny yet cute read.  I loved how the wolves shape shifted and slept in the women's bed.  The chemistry between the women and the werewolves was definitely off the charts.  All the werewolves are sexy but I felt sorry for Trak who has yet to find his forever mate but hopefully a future book will bring his happy ending.

Her perfect mates by A C Arthur

5 stars

Fantastic book with an unusual yet sensual narrative.

Caroline is a vet, and she moved to a small town to get away from her past and make a fresh start.  Her life turns upside down when a hot sexy guy called, Malec comes in with an injured animal.

Malec is instantly hard just looking at the sexy vet but he doesn't have sex with humans no mater how tempting she is to taste.

Malec is a Lycan, a hybrid werewolf.  He resides with his pack but over the years he has shared women with another Lycan called, Channing.  Malec's past doesn't allow him to emotionally connect to the females therefore, Malec's sole objective is to pleasure the woman whereas, Channing is the emotional care giver.

There's a strong sexual attraction between Caroline and Malec from the moment they meet.  However, Malec is haunted by his past and therefore resists his attraction.

Injured animals, mysteriously keep appearing. Malec during his run smells the scent of another Lycan which is not from his pack.  Could these two things be related?

Channing and Malec go to a bar to release stress only to cross paths with Caroline.  When Malec takes her to the dance floor and Channing comes up behind her, grinding into her, she's aroused by the two sensational men offering her pleasures beyond her wildest dreams.  She resists temptations as she doesn't want her name tarnished as a vet.

Will she succumb to her sexual desires involving these men?

I had a weakness for such man. What make this one so different is the heroine, Manny, who suffer a rare mental problem.

Manny is a short little petite young lady who had reactive attachment disorder and difficulty in interpreting people emotion. She don't understand hidden meaning or innuendo. Actually she felt pretty much like most of the autism characters that I read before. The main difference is, she is susceptible to violence when she is having one of her major breakdown.

Due to her condition and the need to be brutally honest, this bring forth many hilarious and surreal conversation between her and Luca. Plenty of WTF and LoL moments.

Luca is a the kind of harmless bad boy who enjoying his single life. His encounter with Manny make him intrigue with her colorful personality. He can't keep this weird girl out of his mind.

I totally get what makes Luca want to be with Manny. But this girl don't know how to love someone and never been in a relationship before. Everything to her is foreign and she don't even like people touching her. The whole no touching rules she impose on Luca felt too much to me. It reminds me of the TV series Pushing Daisies whereby if Lee Pace ever touch his girlfriend, she will drop dead.

Back to Luca and Manny, their relationship is totally out of norm and I love seeing how they become such an intimate item. But honestly, I felt that Luca is working too hard for it. He is the kind of guy who can get whoever he want, but he seems to suffer so much to be with this difficult girl. If you like reading such a patient, giving and accepting guy, Luca is your man.","Luca Pagano is the bad boy, the rebel",1423180800,,

Now she's working at a saloon trying to save enough money to finish the trip to San Francisco her family initially set out on. Jessie begins noticing signs that the chupacabra's curse may have survived their last deadly encounter. Townspeople start to go missing but not all the disappearances can be blamed on the chupacabra. Legend of The Chupacabra is the third book in the Chupacabra series.

Legend Of The Chupacabra is a great addition to the Chupacabra series. It combines elements from the previous books while increasing the stakes and action. The world building gives a great western interpretation of Portland during 1878. I liked how the story incorporated seafaring details that affected the town such as shore leave, trade, and recruitment. I also liked the attention paid to weaponry from the era. The action scenes with the saber gave the story a fun and exciting swashbuckling quality.

Characters from previous books were reintroduced along with the inclusion of additional new characters. There was a secondary plot involving the monstrous acts of humans that was both independent and intertwined with the threat of the chupacabra. I liked that both storylines were equally intense in terms of conflict and action while later combining to create a suspenseful and dramatic outcome.

I'm always wary of any type of media that portrays Native Americans. This series is one of the few that I felt handled it well, components are concise but fleshed out to the point that it feels credible to the story it's trying to tell. I would have liked to have gotten to know Tree Cradle better but she felt more like an extension of the curse's back story. In this installment the chupacabra's origin mythos is further explored and the curse is revealed to have more perilous variables. The story introduces a frightening new manifestation of the chupacabra that further heightens the tension.

I enjoyed reading the Legend Of The Chupacabra. The viewpoint transitions are smoother and the increased suspense creates an engaging horror story where every character is in danger. The story ends with a dramatic conclusion that hints at an ominous future for everyone involved.

I'm going more toward a 3.5, but listed at 4 due to pure cuteness.

What a great concept for the plot! Fellow co-workers for an online magazine get thrown together by their bosses to write stories on the best places in their city to 'date' for Valentine's Day. HOW they come up with their story is completely up to them. For the characters in Time Out, that means actually going out on dates. And, falling in love, of course!

Ms. Dozier put together a quick, easy-to-read contemporary romance. A bit quirky, the characters were definitely chuckle worthy a few times.

My issue which pulls me more toward that 3.5 is there are a handful of dialogue / cliche moments where I really felt Ms. Dozier could have made a little more impact.

Mason Cambridge is a young, popular, and very talented bartender with hopes of one day owning the bar where he works when his boss and friend retires.  But Mason has baggage. Completely heart-wrenching baggage that he feels he has to deal with alone.

Lexi Swafford returns to Creekview, Tennessee, a place she loved to visit her grandparents, and finds herself on a barstool in front of Mason.  Lexi has her own baggage in the form of a cheating ex and uncertain future, and is determined to never let herself become vulnerable again.  She never expected her new job as bartender trainee to Mason to change everything for everyone.

Mason agrees to let Lexi be his roommate while she waits for an apartment to open up in a new complex.  They work together, room together, and begin to spend all of their time together in a new-found friendship.  But neither one of them is prepared for the pull to the other that they feel.  One drunken night between friends unleashes secrets, self-doubt, avoidance, and longing that truly tests the bonds that have begun to form between them.

I can't tell you much more without spoiling this wonderful book.  Mason is amazing, and I just want to hug him soothingly, and shake him hard all at the same time.  His past has him by the throat, and his stubbornness to let others in breaks my heart.  Lexi is the only one who seems able to reach him, but he tries his hardest to keep her out.

The chemistry these two have is amazing, and I love them both! Mason is the kind of guy that takes forever to reach, but the fight is worth it. I just love him hard!

That in no what changes my opinion of this book.  With that said this was a quirky quick read, and I enjoyed parts of it.

It is the second Java Jive mystery, I didn't read the first, however I didn't feel like I'd lost too much by not reading the first.  I was never lost, most of what you need is given to you in the story.  The main character Juliet is a down on her luck musician who can no longer preform in front of people, because of stage fright.  Her best friend Pete won't let her live in poverty though, and gives her a job managing his coffee house Java Jive.  While getting ready for the annual Holiday 5K Race organized by Pete's snobby socialite girlfriend, Cecilia Hollingsworth, Juliet finds said girlfriend dead in their Java Jive sale booth.  Seeing Pete going down for a crime he didn't commit Juliet finds herself needing to solve this crime.  It was a standard plot though it didn't really give many clues as to the crime, instead it mostly feed the answer to us at the end.  I could have really enjoyed this book but there were these flash backs that happened many times during the book.  They were just little anecdotal storied that didn't further the plot they added nothing to the book except to add pages; and they were boring.  These little flash backs distracted from the story and I ended up sitting down my kindle during a couple of them.  Only to pick it back up later and sigh as I read through them.  They should have been cut from the book as they pertained to stuff that happened during either their childhood or college, didn't have anything to do with the murder, and added no extra merit to the story.

Also instead of one love interest or even a triangle, there is a love trio of three suitors for Juliet.  We have not only the best friend Pete who flirts but never declares, Stan the rich brother of Cecilia, but there is also Ryder a cop who is also after Juliet's love.  And this just didn't work for me.  Stan is a sad man, Pete while professing love for Cecilia who just died he still flirts and seems to want Juliet which seemed off, and Ryder who has lost a wife and is ready to move on what the only one who really worked.  I hated that she dated two of these during the same time.  It just didn't work for me and I didn't care for it.

This is not a bad story but I probably won't read anymore books in this series.  I might try a different series by this author in the future though.","OK Mystery, Nothing Special...",1461369600,,

Gemini is the story of Zoe and Cade. Zoe has had a really tough life. Abused as a child and abandoned by the most important people to her during her childhood, she has built an almost impenetrable wall around her heart. The one place she lets her light shine is on stage while singing. Her band, The Eternals, is made up of her closest friends. We meet both Zoe and Cade on Zoe's 21st birthday in the club where she performs. When they meet she knows immediately he is her soul mate. Cade can feel she has been hurt in some way and realizes she needs to go slow while getting to know him so he can break through her wall and fall in love. This story is so fantastic I am trying not to give too much away! It is a story of Adam and Eve. Only here, in this time, they are called Zoe and Cade. It takes place in modern times and occasionally we see small glimpses in the past which helps to explain the story (the whys and what's going on things of the story). I really loved Cade. He was sweet, understanding, patient and kind. He had so much more patience than I ever could. Zoe was easy for me to like in the beginning. As the story went on it was harder and harder to really like her. She was funny, sweet, kind. She then turned way to self centered for me. As I kept reading I understood where she was coming from and I even started to agree with her views somewhat. The side characters were absolutely fantastic! I really hope to see more of them. Especially Micah, Julian and Phoebe. Most of the characters showed a bit of growth throughout the book. Zoe's transformation was the biggest. I really enjoyed seeing her go from selfish naive girl to a beautiful soul willing to put others before herself. I had many many questions while reading this book. I liked that the author adressed each one I had and explained it. I found my questions being answered as events unfolded. Zoe learned  at the same time as me. I found the book easy to keep up with time wise. There was no skipping around. Nothing seemed rushed or unfinished even in the end.

Excellent write up and  I especially like that Watson doesn't let this bio get dragged down in personal rosters or legislative affairs.

One Word: True

Beneath a tough faade, some people carry the burden of seemingly unmentionable secrets.

On the surface, Macy seems to have it all, a best friend, great boyfriend and loving family (even if her relationship with her mom is tumultuous). Until the night she encounters the mysterious Sebastian at a party. Only he seems able to see that her eyes belie the girl she seems to be. He knows it. She knows it and for the first time, she the real Macy wants the be seen. But, the next day Sebastian ends up on a psych ward for substance abuse. What could have been a one time encounter continues as she visits him in the hospital and the two develop a fast friendship and maybe more.

Like Macy, I've hidden secrets I thought too shameful to tell and like her, I've met someone with whom I had an immediate connection and no longer wanted to keep what happened to me secret.  I can so relate to that connection, I almost wish Natasha Sinel had forgone the romantic overtures in favor of pure friendship, because that type connection transcends romance, in my experience.

Sinel gave Macy an authentic, compelling voice. Her pain was palpable. She was a complex character, not always kind to her family, but what teenager is? Her underlying anger is certainly justified. I loved the diverse cast of minor characters as well.

THE FIX made me feel so many emotions on so many levels. Sadness. Fury. Hope. I keep erasing detailed examples, because I don't want to spoil anything for readers.

Let me start off by saying the story was awesome. I was glued to my chair with my kindle in my hands and devoured every single word of this book.  The writing was absolutely flawless and the characters were so realistic and easy to connect with.

Isa was so strong and brave. Her home life was horrible and heartbreaking. My heart broke for the way she was treated. I wanted to crawl into my kindle and give her a hug so many times while reading this book. I loved her relationship with her grandma and understood why she thought so little of herself.

  I live in my own little shell as the outcast. Sometimes I feel like I can barely breathe, like the walls are closing in. My worst fear is that Ill die in that damn shell, probably by asphyxiation.

The author created characters that felt so real and wrote emotions raw and heartbreaking at times you felt like you were actually standing there witnessing things as they played out.

 Kyler and Kai Meyers are brothers that live next door to Isa. She has had a crush on the one for years and use to be close to the other one. I cannot express how much I hated Isas sister Hannah. She was heartless and just cruel. I would of loved to have gotten my hands around her neck so many times while reading this. This book brought out so many emotions and that is what separates a good book from a fantastic book!

  Life is all about the experiences, the good ones and the bad ones.

This book consumed me and when I got to the end I saw red!!!!  This plot is unique and heartbreaking at times but I love how the author still added humor and some fantastic banter between characters.

Science fiction is always strangely fascinating, but this author takes fascinating to a whole new level as he intertwines the existence of 4 beings living parallel-like lives in completely different eras.

It is with relief that I have finished this book. Endless is an apt title for multiple reasons. However, I don't want that to suggest this book is not worth reading. Quite the contrary in fact. This book essentially is a start to a vast quest of a ragtag band of 5 people from varied backgrounds, different worlds in fact. We are introduced in alternating chapters to John, who comes from Earth after a horrible apocalyptic event, and then Telda and Ceria who reside in the other world. From there, they meet each other and journey across many lands in the attempt to defeat the horrible Half-man and the Endless, light beasts that can kill large volumes of people easily and without remorse. They are joined also by Manvedian, a character that has perhaps different goals.

There are many strengths of this book. I was very impressed by the creation of another world, with different kingdoms warring against each other, different sort of beasts and culture. The magnitude and scope of the book in itself is daunting and vast. The prose is beautifully written and descriptions well done. I admired the development of two particular characters: John and Manvedian. John has been thrust into a completely different world, losing someone he loved back in his home planet, and has to figure out his new place in this society. Manvedian was probably my favorite-- I will not give away his secrets, but he is a fascinating character that I hope we will see of more in the future.

The book is long. It took me three weeks to finish and I usually finish a book in 2-3 days. It reminded me a lot of Fellowship of the Ring where we journey for a long way with hobbits until the action picks up a lot at the end, leading up to the Two Towers. In this book, we have Ceria instead of a ring, as a tool to end overwhelming evil. But like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's worth staying until the end. I look forward to seeing where this goes in the next installment.","Elegantly written, vast and impressive world building, intriguing characters... but be forewarned, it's long!",1331337600,,

There is nothing cozy about a murder, even if nobody uses profane language and there are no graphic description of sexual intercourse. God created human beings as animals that procreate by sexual intercourse and have the capability to enjoy it, so a disrespect for sex is a disrespect for the divine being that created it! But that same divine being gave ten commandments, one of which forbid murders. So there is never anything cozy about a murder mystery, and it is about time to abolish such disrespectful language.

That said, I prefer mystery stories where the decent people outnumber the hateful, corrupt, vicious people by a wide margin. In my limited experience of my 66 years in this lifetime, that is much more realistic than peacetime situations where everyone is a creep or a scoundrel.

This author does a very good job of creating murder mysteries where most people are imperfect but mostly very good in spite of flaws and in spite of dealing with difficult circumstances. So the few people who are bad enough to commit murders are all the more shocking by the contrast with characters who are struggling against much worse circumstances and not even tempted to break that commandment!

Not quite as well written as most of the books that I give a rare five stars review. But an especially good picture of human strengths and weaknesses in a variety of challenging circumstances, and how character triumphs over adversity while weakness makes excuses for horrible behavior while yielding to temptation at the slightest provocation. In other words, the bad guys are bad because they choose to be bad, not because they were in a horrible situation. Good people remain good even in more desperate circumstances. Character matters.","Better than most ""cozy mysteries""",1519171200,,

Prescott is a very successful architect who takes peace in the fact that his life is very simple and calm. He has but does not use electronic devices and likes to become one with nature when preparing for his next design. Prescott prefers the quiet life though he came from a very chaotic family.

Holly is the complete opposite of Prescott and is determined to get her a position within the company of a very successful man who is not too nice. Holly cannot go through her day without having some electronic device in use. When her boss decides thanks to his wife that he must have a Prescott Chance home, Holly is given the task of making Prescott say yes after already having said no.

Holly and Prescott meet and due to her determination and just something about her, Prescott agrees to work with her if she can find the right home within 5 sites. So Holly naturally sets out on a mission only to entangle her life into the life of Prescott Chance despite the fact that they are complete opposites.

This book was one of my favorites. Watching Holly and Prescott fall in love and not even realize it knowing they are so different and nothing like what they would normally date but yet something is just so right.

Malcolm and Wes have compatibility and sexual chemistry. Even their differences compliment each other's personalities. My Summer of Wes has a happy ending and is endearing and romantic.

I only noticed it accidentally this past weekend. I can't believe l allowed this little gem to go unnoticed for so long. I didn't even care that this was a rehash of the exact same story for the fourth and final time. All that mattered is that it was Liam's and Yuri's story.

Seeing things from Liam's perspective was great. I'd already gotten to know him a little bit from the the three other books. My anticipated idea of how much I'd enjoy this story was met. What made the difference was his sweetness and innocence. He was introverted, afraid of crowds, really big people, and loud noises. He wasn't outgoing or self confident or brave. Liam definitely couldn't fight. If he tried to punch someone he'd probably end up punching himself. But he could scream, louder than most. His three best friends helped as much as they could, but Liam needed someone just for himself, someone - a man who would stand between him and the world.

Yuri was just that man. He was built like a semi truck. Despite being huge and relied on by his brothers for his strength, Yuri was gentle giant. He was afraid he'd be too much for the little man that was destined to be his mate. Especially with the enormous secret he was hiding. Yuri was shocked by the his small mate's acceptance of his tiger and eagerness to be claimed. He loved that his mate wasn't scared of him or intimidated by his size.

As different as they were from each other it was their similarities that cemented their bond. Both loved cuddling, laughing, and a certain porch swing.

Rosalind de la Fontaine isn't her real name. She doesn't know it nor does she remember her past. Ryder Sherbrooke finds her when she is around eight. No one is certain that was her age. She was severely beaten and it was a miracle she lived. Ryder and Sophia Sherbrooke took her in and raise her as a relative.

Her first season in London, she meets and marries Nicholas Vail. What neither of them are aware of is both have within them very powerful magic. You see, both are descendants of wizards. The answer to their past unfolds like a mystery. Both have an important mission to carry out.

There are certain things about audiobooks that just drive me nuts. I'm not a fan of when a woman has to do the mans voice. But when she doesn't do it well, it throws the story off. And here is the thing that I think absolutely turned me off of this audiobook so bad I almost didn't finish it.... When the narrator sounds happy/laughing/excited when she shouldn't be. There were only two ways her voice sounded during this book- normal and happy/laughing. I know normally this would be ok but when you have a book that has a very large share of sex and steam in it, you don't want it to sound like the character is laughing. Our leading lady is full of spitfire and sass and instead of some comments coming off as smartass or sassy, they sounded like she was laughing. Instead of sounding like she was in midst of a toe curling orgasm, it sounded like she was laughing. This really threw me off of the book. I wanted to be able to hear the sass, and sexy, and steam and I totally didn't get it. I actually found myself skipping through chapters because by 75% I just wanted to know how the story was going to end.

Now as for the story, I'm a huge mc fan. There were a few things I didn't like- this woman was in the army, I can't believe she would let herself be in the relationship she was with Jeremiah. And she just continued to take the abuse. But Rachael did manage to still throw me through some major loops. Who her rapist was. What she was hiding. How bad it was.

http://mnonmklreviews.blogspot.com/2015/03/review-scoring-his-heart.html

I love hockey books. So while the synopsis and menage made me cringe, I wanted in with this story. There's honestly not a hockey, baseball, football based romance that will steer me away.

When Zoe first walks in on her best friend making out with her crush, she's shocked. Two men's men who she likes...

And they could never like her back.

I liked Zoe for the most part. She was a well-written nineteen year old. She was a daddy's girl, her mother abandoned her, and she was super smart and getting prepared to be a doctor. Her 'in' with the hockey players was her father owned the bar they frequented.

When Zoe walked in on them, Misha and Gavin's friendship took a four-month hit. They were used to doing sexual things with eachother in the company of a female, but this was the first time they'd kissed one another without another player (err, girl). Misha very much likes girls, but he likes Gavin too. He doesn't want to ruin the friendship he has with his best friend; besides, he knows that Zoe likes Gavin and wouldn't want to get in the way of that. He doesn't have forever written in him (which, *clearing throat* I sense his story coming soon!), but Gavin could.

Gavin fancies himself in love with Misha, but once Zoe walked in... he realizes he may like her just as much, if not more.

This love fiasco was a bit interesting to read. You had multiple friendships at play and an impending romance. You had a virgin who was initially terrified, but ended up being extremely open to the idea of being shared.

All in all, the story was hot. It was written well in that aspect.

I have to add, though, the part I appreciate most?

Gavin falling for Zoe quickly -- there wasn't a doubt in his mind that he loved Zoe and he let her know, even though he knew it was said far too quickly. I almost appreciated that he and Misha ended up putting a stop to sharing Zoe -- because when you're talking about forever, I think there are just some things that shouldn't be crossed.

Besides, if Misha does end up sharing word space with Sara... Yeah, there's no way Gavin wants in on that action..!",html I love hockey books,1427068800,,

It's nice that it's erotica, but even nicer when the person behind the word processor really knows how to create believable characters and situations, and them gets them offexplosively. My favorite of the three, Over the Top, features two gentlemanly fireman and a young woman from out of town visiting for a job interview. It's good-natured Southern hospitality at its finest in a tale set in Atlanta. You know it's a going to be a fun ride right from the get-go: West's lead paragraph is a hoot. My next favorite, The Visitor, offers an ingenious set-up for a young guy who is agonizingly hornyhe stupidly broke off with his girlfriend before heading out for a stay in a cabin with another couple who can't stop banging in the overhead bedroom. Let's just say they realize their rudeness and get sympathetic. It's a nice set up, and goes on from there. The third story, Truth & Games, may be the best written. But for my taste, it's more of a romance than erotica. The sex is there, but the emphasis is a love story (with a surprising ending that I won't reveal). Overall, West delivers in these three stories (which are all MMF, the only sexual combination that makes any sense, at least to me).

I was so looking forward to finding out how Mason was going to break through Jesss painful walls and how she was going to teach the scarred fallen angel how to forgive himself. The fact that they clashed so well from the start made the love story that much sweeter. To have Lucifer in the mix as a sort of third wheel and devils advocate was an added bonus. And she sees what kind of faith she has when God tells her what the sacrifice will be in order to save her world.

Jess has sass and stands up to both Mason and Lucifer with the same ease, though her feelings for Mason make things a bit more awkward for her. Their love story starts out sweet and becomes a bit more steamy than might be necessary, for me, but it gives us an insight into how extremely intense and possessive these children of God can be.

Each of the secondary characters become an important part of not only an important set of back stories, but also to the story itself. They are all just as important in their parts whether they be large or small. The loss of a beloved character is heartbreaking and the all-consuming love of the lead characters is passionate.

They can read our minds, make us do things we don't want to do. Teenagers are bad enough under the best of circumstances, what with ratting the roads, being obnoxious in fast food joints (and everywhere else), roving in gangs, being disruptive and disrespectful, and all manners of mayhem. Throw in the mind control stuff, and, well, they're a menace to be removed.

Thus the general British public is probably thinking with the rise of the teenage percievers. These percievers cannot read minds, nor can they control them. They can barely manage their own minds--why would anyone think they're out to direct others? No, the percievers can sense general emotions and sincerity, at least through most of this story.

Its the only way to handle things you refuse to understand, right? Except for the Cure, of course. While the band, The Cure, might well play into the emotions of most/many teenagers, this Cure is a means of removing the perceiving disease to restore the perverted teens to normalcy.

According to the commercials for the Cure, all the kids are super happy to be fixed and immediately turn into well-adjusted, normal individuals. And commercials never lie, right? Your results may vary. Wildly.

Michael remembers waking up in a room, trying to escape a bunch of men and <spoiler>stabbing one of them to get away</spoiler>. Eventually, Michael, a mere norm (non-perciever), gets hooked up with a couple or perceiving teenagers (Otis and Jennifer). More like they let him sleep on their couch. They decide to figure out exactly what the Cure is, and then things get wild.

Did you know that teenagers have a small streak of rebellion in them? Yes? No? Well, they do. Really, its true. This plays no small part.

The first four to five chapters were kind of humdrum, relatively speaking. Good in the modern sense of grabbing you and not wanting you to let go. Read enough stories that start this way, though, and it needs to stand out from the pack a little more. After this introduction, the story picks up, becomes its own. Some things I suspected were shown to be true. Others, to be false but supplanted by much stronger ideas. I grew to love the characters over the course of the book. Hate one or two, also.

This is the first in a series of books (four total as of this writing) about the Percievers. The author has done me proud in writing a book that stands on its own yet whets my appetite to want to read more of the story. Kudos! A strong 4 stars.

Kendall and Johnnies story will break your heart, make you cry and take you through a kaleidoscope of emotions.  Kendall, her mother and sister are all victims in a world gone mad.  Innocence had been stripped from their eyes and only the evil done by monsters remained.  Why do bad things happen to good people?  How did she become so entrapped in this seedy side of life? Involved with the president of another MC she has no choice but to do whatever is demanded of her! Her sisters life was at stake!

Johnnie has been left in charge of the Death Dwellers MC while the Prez is on his honeymoon.  The only thing that Johnnie wants is to keep it together until Outlaw the leader of the MC returns. The heavy tension that surrounds the club is due to the conflict between the Death Dwellers and the Torpedoes.  War is on the horizon with blood and death for each club.  If Johnnie can just keep things together and put out all fires while he is in charge, life would be great.  Before Outlaw left a beautiful woman had tried to seduce him to cause problems between the Prez and his wife, but instead Johnnie had taken care of her.  He felt like she was the one that got away and maybe the one that could help him let go of his feelings for Meggie the Prezs wife.

Kendall is struggling to make sense of what is happening in the world around her.  How does Johnnie fit into her world and her into his world? Will she be able to get away from her ex?  Or will evil win?

Gustav Levi is watching Serena spread her wings and fly.  The demand for her photos grows exponentially with each assignment that she accepts, but now they are demanding her body and soul.

**Slight Spoilers**

Chris Scaife is rich, super successful and has 3 children by two different women.  One woman uses him as an ATM for herself; the other uses him as an ATM for her family.  Either way, Chris feels used for money.  This makes him cynical; gifts are his currency of love and caring with the women in his life and with his children.

Robyn is coming out of a bad divorce; after years of marriage, her husband is expecting a child with someone else. Robyn is somewhat broken and very fragile, but resilient.  She's a nurturer.

The best part of this story, if you've known Chris since Commitment, is watching him become an even better man (and he's really a good guy at his core) with a good woman influencing him.  It is slow.  It takes a long time and there are plenty of missteps.  But well worth the wait.

Frustrated, she comes up with a plan with her best friend in order to get her revenge. She disguises herself as a guy and successfully become a member of the band. Being Sticks, a gay man, is not easy, and she gets herself into all kinds of situations because of her disguise.

What begins as a plot for revenge becomes something more when she realizes she doesnt want to quit the group and when she falls for the lead singer, whos not the player she thought he would be. Furthermore, it seems that they have a great chemistry from the few times she meets him as a girl. Hes even written a song about her! Its too late when she regrets what she has done, because she won't be able to reveal who she really is without hurting him deeply.

This book is a great addition to the Forbidden Men series. It was funny, entertaining, and just anything we would expect from the author. Remy speaks Spanish, so there is a lot of it in the novel, but we can understand what she means, in general. The prologue really made an impression. It starts with a scene one month after the events, and we are then told the story from the beginning. It totally made me want to know what happened to lead to that moment.

The plot is kind of not believable, because why wouldnt people recognize she was a girl after so long in her presence? There were many clues, and I was surprised that only one person discovered it beforehand. The disguise was not what I expected. I thought she would only change a few things, like the normal wig and bandages for the chest, but she got herself the entire kit. A latex mask, some sort of jacket that would hide her breasts, and all kinds of things that would be useful to keep her secret.

Asher is not like what I thought he would be, from the small glimpses we get of him in the previous books, but in a good way. Hes not the bad boy rocker we could imagine, but more like the hot lead singer/manager/songwriter of the band. Hes responsible and really sweet. Even if he could get any girl, he wants a connection with someone who understands him. Hes envious of what the other workers of the club have with their significant other. He won't know what hit him when Remy comes into his life.

My Rating: 5/5 stars
My Mini-Review:

Haley Miller has a reputation to uphold and damn it all if she is going to let her hard earned party girl persona fade into the past.  The problem with maintaining her reputation is twofold: 1) she has been logging 80 hours work weeks between two cities and 2) the guy she has lusted after and crushed on since high school just isn't into party girls with a reputation.

Seth Gardner has a dilemma on his hands.  His aunt and uncle are in a financial bind thanks to their neighbor and his bad business practices.  That neighbor just happens to be Haley Millers dad and Haley Miller just happens to be the girl Seth has lusted after and crushed on since high school.  How to deal with a dilemma????  In a perfect world, the two would just confess their feelings to each other and be done with it.  In a naughty world, Seth will uncharacteristically answer and online posting by Haley to fulfill her second wildest fantasy, to orgasm while tending bar.  Thank goodness this is a naughty world 

When the time and date of her scheduled encounter arrives, Haley has no idea who her mystery man is.  She is excited, almost to the point of distraction until she runs into Seth.  The encounter with the mystery man feels like a betrayal of her feelings for Seth and she doesnt want to risk running him off.  Unfortunately, circumstances prevent her from cancelling the encounter and before she knows it, Haley is mixing up chocolate martinis for her friends while her mystery man plays her lower body like a finely tuned instrument.  Her mystery man isn't just good, he is fanfreakintastic and is she finds out who he is, there may just be a real future for the two of them.

The Bottom Line:  The Bad Boys Guarantee is by far the hottest book in this novella series and I loved every minute of it!!  Both Haley and Seth are completely likeable characters who are in really tough positions.  Haley wants nothing more than to help her dad out but her dad has been far less than honest about his financial situation.  Seth is determined to see his aunt and uncle back on sure financial footing and can only do that if he gets some straight and honest answers out of Haleys dad.  Complicating everything is the intense attraction Haley and Seth feel for one another and the very real feelings both have been harboring since high school.  This isn't just sweet HEA, its also a dirty little read that is funny and intense.  Haley and Seth are by far my two favorite Regret Hollow characters and I so hope they make an appearance in the final installment of the series.",Book #3: The Bad Boys of Regret Hollow Series,1462406400,,

I liked that Jax respected her enough to give her time to grow even thought it was hard on him.  He was always the gentlemen and showed how much he cared for Dori.  Dori was a unique character that seemed to be in the wrong time period.  She had simple needs and wants and was very open minded to the things that were presented to her. I thought it had a good storyline, likeable characters and the ""Dragon rules"" were very unique. The time span of the book was over a long period of time but we only got to see a few instances of interactions between Jax and Dori.  I would have like to have had more scenes of them getting to know each other instead of a brief reference to the events. I also would have liked to have heard more about their life on the island.

Review Courtesy of April Hollingworth

Another wonderfully fun and brilliant book by the fabulously talented Molly Harper. Snow Falling on Bluegrass is a fabulous story of taking a chance on yourself. Of allowing your own happiness to take precedence even if it means being alone. This is the third book in The Bluegrass Series but can be read as a standalone. Witty and smart, this wonderful book, and a must read. Molly Harper is an author to remember.

The Review:

Executive assistant extraordinaire Kelsey, is known around the office for her unflappable control in any situation. So when Kelsey and her fellow co-workers of the Kentucky Tourism Commission head off for their office retreat, no ones surprised that she and her boss Sadie have everything planned.
An unprecedented snow storm changes things when it knocks out the power, trees and generally brings the state to a standstill, trapping the group in the lodge. Thankfully they have open fireplaces and plenty of food, to keep them from turning on each other.
Kelsey has had the fiercest crush on gorgeous Charlie, the offices statistician for the three years she has worked with him, and is tempted to find a warm spot to snuggle up with him, except she just doesnt know how he feels about her. But the handsome Ranger Luke, the only staff member in the lodge makes it very clear that he would love to keep her mind off of Charlie, and any other distractions she has.
Though the weekend is meant to be all about work, Kelsey cant help her mind wandering, and her feeling of conflictions grow over who she wants, Luke or Charlie. Both are wonderful, but she can only have one.

I love Celia Kyle and the Ridgeville Series, but the last 2 books I've read from (books 3 and 4) it just seemed to be missing the chemistry.  This book was around 100 pages, and I never really felt the connection between the hero and heroine. The insta-love was almost an overkill.  I get that they can find their mate with just a sniff, but come on, can't they also get to know one another?? They sniff, they have sex, and live happily ever after.  It was just missing any sense of foundation for me personally. It lacked character and plot depth/development.  The sex was hot, but even that wasn't enough to redeem this story because I felt nothing for the characters.  I also feel it to be quite overpriced at $4.99 - it's a short book where very little happens. At this point I'm not sure I will even continue reading this series.  At very least I'll be taking a break from it for a while.",Almost too short - made for a bad case of insta-love,1427155200,,

I mean sure, I had a summer job, a lot of book tours and family traveling in and out of the country. But still! Look at the cover? Isn't it fantastic? I absolutely fell in love with it! The rest of the covers in the series are equally as amazing.

I just want to stare at them all day. That and well, read them as well.

Anyhow, the book talks about Marina, a girl who's so used to traveling the world with her father until one day he heads of to Afghanistan and thinks this time it would be dangerous to take her along. Marina isn't happy about it, but her dad had put his foot down, so she's forced to spend that year with her aunt and cousin. As she starts her life there she realizes two things; one, all the surfer kids - except Ethan- are jerks; two, there was some strange creature in the sea. Even though she nearly drowns more than once, Marina is still drawn to the creature in the sea. Her cousin Cruz and his best friend Megan, try to discourage her, but she's determined to know more about this creature in the sea, especially when the creature implies Marina might be one of them. Problem is, that's not all they'd want, and Marina is scared that they'd hurt someone she loves to get to her. How can she stop that? And the terrifying nightmares that have been making her sleepwalk every night? Can Ethan help her? Or would that just put him in danger too?

I love mermaids. And Ariel of all things is my absolute favourite. Seriously. I loved that cartoon as a kid and have been into the idea of them even with how they're described in Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean. I know some legends show them in any other form but the complimentary one, but I choose to go with the one involving Ariel. So, the more I read this book the more I was drawn into it. It is such a great summer read! I love the idea of the ocean and sea creatures - even mystical ones. I lived right infront of the sea in Kuwait so I had a lovely view every morning. However, I was terrified of sharks -still am- so it's the main reason I stopped swimming for a while. Therefore I can't understand how Marina would still go into the water after nearly drowning more than once.

The characters were really great, though I'd personally love an aunt 'Evie' too! One who'd pamper me with expensive clothes and cars and such. Although I don't care for them that much, but who hates being pampered? I like the idea of Ethan. A hardworking boy who wants to be independent, he is responsible , nice and very friendly. I love how he worries about Marina when she nearly drowns even though he barely knew her at the time. He was  a nice contrast to Cruz, who I also loved. His relationship with Marina was amazing, too bad I don't have similar relationships with my cousins!

The writing was good, the style was flowing and easy, and the events were intriguing. The story did remind me a bit of 'Telesa - The Covenant Keeper' which I had reviewed recently. But the protagonists seemed to have opposite powers to the ones in this book, plus it was a slightly different setting. But I think this one was a bit more my style, I really enjoyed it!

Now, I'll have to get my hands on the other three books! I just hope they're just as good.

So as I said in my review of The Curse of the Sphinx (Book 1) I had never read Mythology books before. However this series has opened my eyes to a whole new reading world. I can honestly say that this book is by far my favorite of the two. I was hooked from the quote on the first page. It had such a dramatic affect on me, I could not wait to dig further into the book, and I definitely was not let down. I want very badly to say so much about this book, and the story-line, and the characters, but I won't because I do not want to spoil this treasure for anyone. I will however say, that I LOVE Dahlia and I would absolutely devour a book written about her.

I've read the Signal Bend series and am half way thru the Night Horde series, but this series is probably gonna capture my heart as well.  This book focuses on the Pagano family; there are 6 kids: Carlo Jr, Luca, Camen, John, Joey, and Rosa whose dad runs a construction company. They have two uncles - Ben and Lorrie and a cousin, Nick, who are deep into the Mafia and are kind of the Mafioso of Providence, RI (who knew Providence had Mafia?!). The Pagano's that the book focuses on are not really in the Mafia life, although they occasionally get pulled in trying to help family members or friends.  Carlo Jr is an architect and he meets Sabina Alonzo-Auberon is a beautiful Argentinian who is married to a cruel and powerful butt-face, James Auberon.  Carlo ends up rescuing Sabina from this abusive relationship by having his uncles take care of the matter.  Now most readers would expect Carlo and Sabina to get to their HEA after that, but what happens, surprisingly (but in a good way) is Sabina holds off getting too involved with Carlo until she can stand on her own two feet. At times, this is frustrating, I wanted to tell her, you can be independent and be in a relationship at the same time, but I got it, she had been so passive and submissive with James she really needed to know she could stand on her own two feet. There is another part in the book where Carlo reacts to something that happens to his adorable 3-year-old son Trey, and while I understood his reaction, I don't know if I could have stayed in a relationship after that. It really spoke to Sabina's maturity and sweet spirit that she was able to do so.  A great couple but I really want to read about Luca and Joey.",Great Beginning for a Series,1522281600,,

This is the third book in a trilogy but still works well as a standalone story. A nephilim, Emma Jane loves her angel partner, Eli, but consummating their love means that Eli is now a fallen angel  one of the angels she is supposed to kill! Her father is also a fallen archangel and he has plans for her . . . ones that conflict with her original goals. Now shes confused as she cant trust anyone but Eli and her love for him makes her really want to redeem him  whether he wants that or not! Life certainly isn't a bed of rose petals for Emma  more a bed of thorns  as the two sides try to use her and her skills against others who were actually her friends. Emma needs to find out who is behind all the drama, angst and try her best to make the right choices, but will that be to save humanity or the angel/man she loves?

Ms. Cheever is a non-black author who took the leap into the BWWM genre ... and, in my opinion, failed miserably with the four novellas contained therein.  In the first novella, the she-wolf is described as ""creamy brown,"" but much later in the story the same she-wolf has ""alabaster"" skin.  If my webster's dictionary is working correctly, the word ""alabaster"" is typically used to described white skin.  And then later, yes, in the same novella, we are told that she has pale cheeks. So which is it?  Is this a BWWM story or did the author initially create the story with a white character in mind?  Confused.

Despite the problems I saw with the first novella, I continued to read.  Yes, the four novellas are formulaic [she-wolf meets vampire/wolf man then she-wolf pretends like she never wants to mate then they come together to battle some great evil then they fall in love and mate.  Simple, but the problems persisted (for me anyway).  In the third novella, the she-wolf is described as ""ebony"" colored.  So, then how does a dark skinned person pale?  And do dark skinned women's nipples resemble cranberries?  Hmm... no.. that would be for another skin color or race.

After reading Ms. Cheever's stories, I really wanted to learn about Lupires and the vampire council.  Great story idea.  I would not, however, want to read this as a BWWM.  Ms. Cheever writes from her own perspective -- so most of her characters that don't look like her still have the same physical attributes (alabaster skin, cranberry nipples, paling when scared, etc.) as she does.  More importantly, there is nothing about these stories (other than the author describing the characters as brown, ebony, earth toned, russet, etc) that would lead anyone to think that the characters are non-white.  Does she have to write a story with a gum cracking, head shaking, finger popping stereotype?  No, but it would be nice to read a BWWM story from Ms. Cheever that made other BW say, ""Wow.  I get it.  I do that too.""  Although well written and edited with love, I didn't get it.  I'll buy Ms. Cheever's novels in the future because I think she is a great writer and I like her style, but not if its a BWWM novel.","Thanks, but no thanks....",1411603200,13,

Fore warning though this is part of a six part serial which doesnt completely come out till the end of october 2014.
Dont let this deter you though its actually a good story and well worth the read.

I really liked Mia she is fierce and quite mature for her age.

Lucas and that Tattoo are hot and ALPHA OMG, definate Knight in shining armour as well. And I love his brother Lev is great I hope he gets his own story.

I think they work well together and look forward to getting to know them more through out the series which i will most definately be following.

There is a sexy scene and its nice and spicy.

Overall I thought it was really good the characters are great the story is exciting and authors style is really quite nice.

Guarded
If you liked the first installment then you are going to LOVE this one.

I love how the story picks up right where the last installment left off no back tracking and no recapping BRILLIANT!!!!!!

I love Lucas and Mia they really have a strong connection both of wolf and human and I really cant wait to read more and see their relationship grow further.

I really enjoyed Mia's boldness it is refreshing and mischievous. Her growing affection for Lucas is evident and I really enjoy their time together. Even though her age would make her quite young she really is quite mature.

Jupiter Mia's roommate is a blast she has some crazy get up though.

Lucas' attempts at keeping his distance from Mia is downright comical especially when he is so adamant at keeping her safe and I find it endearing that he feels he has to. Lucas' reveals from his past is really interesting and traumatic and opens up the world of magic.

I loved how Lucas explains the whole how to be a wolf to Mia especially the mating ritual which I loved. I enjoy how Mia takes the whole wolf thing quite well and eagerly soaks up the knowledge.

I love how the story draws you in so much you feel a part of it. Little twists and turns and a a number of laughs make for a more enjoyable read, I cant wait to find out what happens next. I will MOST DEFINITELY be continuing on with this series.

Hunted
I completely devoured this installment in one sitting!!!!

This follows on from the 2nd installment and I recommend you read the first 2 installments before this one you will want the whole story and you won't be disappointed.

The introduction of the wolf packs is really exciting, I am absolutely loving reading all the new characters and the whole wolf pack world is beyond fascinating.

Mia learns more about what it is like to be a wolf and get a serious introduction to some of the Dark wolves and their barbaric and scary traditions.

Mia is really becoming more alpha learning about her power and asserting herself especially towards Lucas. Lucas is still trying to control himself around Mia with alot of difficulty. Lucas I love more and more with each installment he really has enormous appeal.

The sexy scene is scorching in this installment and I cant wait for more. Mia and Lucas' connection is so believably strong and beautiful, am really looking forward to seeing where they will end up.

I TOTALLY love Colin and he needs his own story an Alpha in the making.

All up this installment is a beauty all the excitements and twists and turns you would want to keep those pages a turning, I am LOVING it!!!! Bring on the next installment. I will MOST DEFINITELY be continuing on with this series.

Captured
If you haven't read this serial yet go get the first one NOW!!!! And I think it's still FREE!!!

This gets better with each instalment, I am loving every moment. So intense I did not put it down for a second!!!!!
We want more We want more!!!!

Mia is really growing from page to page I love her spirit and determination.

Mace is freaking scary and needs a good submitting himself lol!!!!

He'll yeah to the more Colin, I freaking love him!!!!

Lev seriously is so sigh worthy I want my own.

Lucas is still in denial of his feelings and this kidnapping may just be the push he needs to make Mia his mate!!! I'm finding I enjoy Lucas' character more and more with each part, I love when his wolf comes out to play.

It's now starting to get intense Mia has been captured by the red wolves and so has the oh so hilarious Jupiter (her roommate). Jupiter is really cool about Mia being a wolf and so funny I completely laughed out loud.

More twists and turns in this instalment that keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait to see what happens next. Can't wait see Mace get his!!!!

All up another fabulous instalment so close to the end I can't wait to find out what will happen!!! I will most definitely be continuing on with the series.

Sacrificed
ARRRRHHHH I cant wait much longer for the next and final instalment of this serial I WANT TO READ IT SO BAD!!!!

Could not put it down had to read in one sitting AMAZING!!!! AMAZING!!!

I freaking loved this addition Lucas is fierce and strong and AH MAY ZING!!!!! Love him!!!

Mia is so bold and brave, and has excelled as a character beyond my belief, Love her!!!!

This by far has to be the most gut wrenching of them all so far so much blood and violence and action and suspense, I loved every minute of it.

Jak is an interesting character, Alisa Woods has this incredible knack to introduce characters that you immediately love and want to read their stories. I can see about a million spinoff serials just from this instalment alone. Hello to the new shifters did not expect that (I won't say more here as too much of a spoiler) definately need more of this!!!!

Thank you for the more of Colin much appreciated  Yes I still love him and I still think he needs to star in his own spin off HINT HINT!!!!!

Lev Oh My what the!!!!!!! Somebody get their ass in gear and fix this now!!!!!

Action packed and the twists Oh the twists and turns are Fabulous!!!!

I need the ending now though Im on the edge of my seat white knuckling the darn thing.

All up another FAN FLIPPING TASTIC instalment and I cannot wait until the next and final one is out!!!! I am most definitely continuing with the series and most definitely ENCOURAGE further stories/spinoffs from this author for this series FREAKING LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!

Claimed
LOVED IT!!!! Read it in one sitting Could NOT Put it DOWN!!!!!!

Following these characters on their journey has been and excellent reading experience I enjoyed every minute and look forward to much more from Alisa Woods and her shifters.

Yes there could have been more I wanted more, but I think you need to re-read this as a whole story and you will enjoy it more. **NOTE: - Just so happens the complete story is due out very soon.**

I loved how Alisa Woods just got on with it no stretching the ending to get more suspense. The sexy scenes were hot and spicy and the connection was instant and believable.

I loved Mia's courage and firmness in her choice she wanted the love and the mate to be a whole, not just a stepping stone to a maybe love.

I don't know how she did it but I believe Lucas got hotter in this instalment. His love for Mia really shines and feels important. I really loved alot of Lucas' lines, could not get enough.

The mating is intense and their connection feels instant and true.

Sigh** I'm going to miss Colin but hopefully he will pop up again????
And Lev oh how I will miss Lev!!!!

The world that Alisa Woods has created has many a fan wondering where will she lead to next and hanging on every glimpse of future work coming our way. The wondrous array of brilliant characters has given me a taste of what I cant wait to read whose story will be next and what is going to happen, really exciting. I am so freaking excited that the series will be continued with Jak's story there is so much more to him and I want to know.

It  is the holiday season in Solitude, Oregon, but it's anything but merry and bright.  When Carly's brother, Bruce goes missing and his girlfriend is found murdered, it's up to Seth, to solve the case and keep his family safe.

It seems like it's been a long time since I have touched base with this series, so I was happy to see a pair of novellas coming out this month- this one from Melinda Leigh and Dead in Her Tracks By Kendra Elliot.

This story reunites us with Seth and Carly, who are back together and making their marriage the top priority is their lives now.  But, when Bruce's girlfriend is found murdered,  they find it hard to find balance in their personal lives, especially when a young child is left without parents.

This is one action packed story, though,  a little gritty, and pretty realistic as the author showcases just how dumb criminals can be and the horrible consequences of their actions.

I was happy to touch base with Seth and Carly, and am thankful that this couple are working things out, and that for once, Seth didn't get on my last nerve. He is really coming along, and showed that he can stick to his guns when it comes to trusting his wife and letting her do her job, just like he has to do his.  The pair actually worked together on this one and make a pretty darned good team, if you ask me.

Guilt, anger, second chances, amends, revenge, and love this sums up how your emotions will run wild in this book.  I have to say is wow.  Never reading this author before and diving into this book, made me realize this is why I love reading new authors for the first time.  You never know what to expect and when you get something great, you never want it to end.  This is what that book did for me.  Remember you first love, the one that you heart never stopped beating for and then realize that it was only one sided and you have this emptiness in your heart that never goes away.  I love that this is not the same old story that they find themselves ten years later and it all comes together and everyone goes and lives happily ever after not realizing the consequences of a lie, a stretch of the truth can cause.

The characters in this book are written in so percisely that you feel everything they are feeling and more.  I love that is starts in the city but then goes elsewhere for the plot to become more intense.  Each character tells their story and it all runs together so well being intertwined makes you want all of these people to win in love at the end.  Its beautifully paced and nothing seems to be rushed in the book at all.  It lets you visualize everything that they are feeling and you react the same way as the characters and that is what makes this book so real.  The only real disappointment I had was that is a cliffhanger and I was not expecting that.

Sydney had something traumatic happen to her ten years ago and it has completely changed her. She is not the happy go lucky person she was back then.  She is confused, angry and trying to prove to herself that she is in fact in control.  Easier said and done when it comes to  Simon, her first true love.  She sees him sparingly in the city but when her parents decide to throw a anniversary party all bets will be off.  Sydney is a very strong but fragile character.  I know that doesnt make much sense, but as you read the story you will understand why.  She tries to put her heart in the back burner and concentrate on everything but, but it is hard when Simon keeps popping up unexpectingly all the time.  Simon.  OMG I can only describe him as sex on stick.  He is powerful, gorgeous and determined.  It is exactly what Sydney is not expecting.  So this anniversary weekend is going to be a time not forgotten any time soon.

I know these are the main characters, but really I think you need everyone in this story to make it complete.  Now we can not forget Syndey's sisters.  They are great.  They bring the story to life.  They are Pyros, they love to get into trouble and lets not forget that they are also in love with Simons brothers, which by they way they are triplets.  More sex on a stick in this book and it keeps on coming.  Lexi is Sydney's best friend and I love her to death.  She centers sydney when she needs it and that is what Sydney needs at times. Lets not forget the gay best friend Jacob.  He is totally awesome too.  You've got to love a guy that can touch a girls boobs and get away with it.

This has to be one of my favorite books I have read this year so far.  I can't wait to read the book in this series and can only imagine it will get better.  I would recommend this author to many people and hope that she gets many more followers.

Someone Like You is exactly as advertised. It is a heartwarming romance with a happily-ever-after. It includes forgiveness, redemption, and a relationship that is meant-to-be. Kayleigh and Niall were friends as kids, lost touch, and eventually reunited over a business proposal. There were a few hurdles, but, as is the intent with hurdles, they are eventually overcome.

This book is very well-written. It flowed nicely and the vocabulary was rich and varied. The pacing at which the story unfurled was a bit slow for me. I like to experience more of the relationship rather than having the book end just as the romance begins. In addition, I would have liked a few more suprises within the storyline. However, Someone Like You is the book that it purports to be. What you see is what you get with this book, and if you like a clean, uplifting romance, Someone Like You may be just the book you're looking for!

My grandson is in 3rd grade and this book would be awesome for him. I believe this book should be a part of his extensive library. Something that should be a great read for him. He reads way above his age as he grows so does his knowledge of the world as did his mother at his age. Reading invokes imagination, knowledge from a foundational status. Reading makes the brain work where television arrests the brain function by not making any one think. I so do love these books for children and adults, making us think about what we can do and what might be if we open our minds.

This is book 2 in the Saving Mars series, and picks up where book 1 Saving Mars left off. **Warning, some unavoidable spoilers for book 1 (such as where book 1 left off)**
Jessamyn and Crusty are leaving Earth, leaving behind not only Jess brother Ethan (who has been rebodied), but also 2 other crew members, and Pavel  the earth boy who Jessamyn cant stop thinking about.

Jess and Crusty have even bigger problems to contend with when they get back to Mars though, as the people in charge have different ideas about when they should be rescuing the people left behind. Jess wants to go back immediately  they want to wait a mars annum  2 earth years! But Jessamyn knows that those left behind won't last that long.

There are other things going on that Jess doesnt know about though, and political landmines to avoid too.
Can Jess get permission to lead a rescue mission? Can she go back and save her brother the way she promised? And how many people will get hurt in the process?

OMG I thought Saving Mars was brilliant, and boy did Defying Mars make an equally amazing sequel! Cidney Swanson  you have done it again!!

Having just finished this book my heart is still racing, and Ive got no idea how to burn off this excess adrenalin running through my body! Yikes!
Defying Mars starts off with the crew of the Red Galleon down to just two members, and neither are happy about the situation, not because they cant stand each other, but because it feels so wrong to leave good people behind on a hostile planet.

Jess is once again an amazing character. She has such strength, and her drive and determination are just unfathomable. Shes so young, yet she knows in her heart and in her gut what feels right, and what feels wrong, and she has the guts and determination to pull off remarkable feats that even people more experienced than her would balk at.
I love how Jess reasons things out, how she knows her own limits, and how shes not afraid to admit when she needs help. I also love how strongly she feels for her family and friends, and how her decisions are right, even if they're not for the greater good.

Crusty  the mechanic, was one of the main characters in this second book, and it was nice to get a bit more of a feel for him, and the faith that he put in Jessamyn. His encouragement helped Jessamyn when she needed it most, and his support really meant a lot to her.

Pavel, Ethan, and Wallace back on earth also play a part in this book, though in a lesser part than they did in the first book. It was nice to see how Ethan was able to help matters even in his re-bodied shape, and with even more disability than he had originally. Ethans character is a real testament to how having a disability doesnt mean that you're worthless, and his role in this whole mission is a real inspiration to anyone suffering from any sort of condition which might be labelled a disability.

I loved the storyline in this book. Although there is initially less action in this book than the first, the decisions that Jessamyn must make lend us a different kind of story. Once again Jessamyns decisions are not easily made, and do not make her popular, but she does them anyway, because she does what she feels is right, even if doing these thing benefits other people more than herself.

The ending in this instalment was explosive! The last 20% of the book was just riddled with tension, and so much stress and anxiety. I felt like screaming, or tearing my hair out, or just going totally crazy trying to hold it together while I read the book! (In a good way!) It was just aarrgghh!!!! There are no words  a seriously, epic, amazing, nail biting, edge of your seat, go totally potty, OMG, I totally love this book, what is she going to do now? They cant be serious? Why? Why? Why? No! Im going to be a basket case if this doesnt end soon, god help me! Eek! Oh thank the heavens! Kind of an ending. Seriously. Now I need oxygen!

This serious is truly extraordinary. It has elements of sci-fi, and dystopia, its YA, and has a seriously kick-ass main character, who is truly gifted in her own right. Theres a tiny touch of romance, and some serious edge-of-your-seat action. If you haven't read this series before, or haven't even heard of it  consider yourself told  this series is seriously good! I couldn't recommend it more!!

Alexis (Lexi) Gordon is Katelyn's friend at college. She is a wonderful character. She is funny, sweet and a little naive. But, when her life is turned upside down, she accepts her friend's offer to become immortal. This is her story.

Having read the first story, I was looking forward to reading this one. I started to read the story and, although it mirrored some of the scenes from the previous book, it was interesting to see them through Lexi's eyes. Becoming a vampire actually suits Lexi. She gains more confidence in her abilities, but she is still young and impetuous. The story is told mostly through Lexi's point of view, but Katelyn and a new character, Gale, has their say too. Gale is an intriguing character, who is a 1600 year old vampire. She is one of the ""Old One's"" and is extremely powerful. Gale comes into Lexi's life after a distressing event that, because of Lexi's vampire youth, she is not able to cope with. The story has many twists, but I did find some of the dialogue to be still a little gushy at times. However, it was intriguing to see how Lexi's experiences have shaped her, and made her grow emotionally. I was a little surprised at how she dealt with Mikey, after their relationship ended badly. I certainly wouldn't want to be on Lexi's bad side; she's a woman scorned, and that's all I'm going to say! The story is not full of action, nor is it a romance novel, although there is a bit both, but it is more of a journey of self discovery and emotional growth. The story does not end on a cliffhanger, but I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series as soon as possible.

Rick Veal has written an intriguing story of love, friendship and emotional growth. His characters are lifelike and likable. His writing style is not as fast paced compared to other authors I have read, but the story was written in such a way that I couldn't not keep turning the pages. The flow of the story was wonderful.

There are some scenes of a sensual nature that are a little on the hot side (although not as explicit as some books I have read), so I do not recommend this book for younger readers. I do, however, recommend this book if you love paranormal romances with sexy vampires. - Lynn Worton",A Fantastic Vampire Story!,1402531200,3,

I'd recommend reading the series in order but with this book, Stealing the Bachelor, can be read as a stand alone novel.

Ann Snyder's shop, Chocolate Cravings, is crawling with agents from the various alphabet agencies when she arrives for work on Monday morning. She is being sued by the FDA for selling supplements that stated they cured illness. She has a handcuff hanging from her wrist (They were part of a Halloween costume) when she arrives at Eric Maxwell (his family is rather rich) to seek legal help to figure out how to get to the bottom of the the mess without having to figure out how to accessorize a orange prison jumpsuit. She and Eric went to school with each other in Sweet Creek but a off hand comment he made one day in her sister's diner, hurt her and she has avoided him since then.

He agrees to take her on as a client on one condition, that Ann teaches him how to be a ""bad boy"" instead of a nerd. She agrees to the lessons and has to share his condo after the press starts to hound her about the investigation. But they start to fall in love but not without some trial and errors, including matchmaking by her grandfather, Noah, advice from her sister's husbands,(Don't lie to the Snyder sisters) and when her grandfather gets involved watch out, he's a relentless romantic. Eventually, they both figure out that all of her issues are because of her accountant, Lewis, who's planning a trip to the Cayman Island.

Although I read this one out of order, it still worked for me. I love these MMA fighters, and the women in this series, so for me this was pretty much a sure thing when it came to me liking the book.

So I'm gonna start with Jessica, and first let me start by saying I am horrible with names, like so horrible with names, I have a decade long history of calling all of my best friend's girlfriends Jessica (and none of them have been named Jessica, I'm horrible I know). Anyway for the first couple of chapters every time I read Jessica's name I kind of mentally had to shake myself, but after a while I started to really like her and the character cemented itself in my head. I think what stands out to me the most about her and about this book frankly is how much I found myself laughing. Jessica and Slade had this great dynamic between them, and there was more than one scene in the book where I found myself laughing out loud (especially the scenes with Drogo and the date with the guy who wouldn't stop talking about her womanly time, seriously read it you will laugh out loud too). Jessica was with a guy for a long time who was not good to her, and one day he put her in the hospital, like bad, punctured lung and broken bones bad. But thankfully, Jessica gets out that relationship and her friend Slade really takes care of her, the perfect gentlemen. When the two of them get their relationship going, it was great seeing her really be happy. She was just such a likable character who only wanted the best for the people she cares about.

As for Slade, wow, Slade. I love me a tattooed MMA guy. Slade has a dirty mouth, which I kind of loved, cause it wasn't too much, but it wasn't like he was all sweet and gentle either. I liked that he stood up for Jessica against her ex, I liked that he took care of her, but not in a smoothing kind of way. I think what I liked about him the most, was that all he wanted for Jessica was for her to be happy and to be who she was, nothing more, nothing less. I like that he never gave up, that he was persistent about things, and went after what he cared about, he was really just my kind of hero for a romance book.

I can honestly say I really enjoy this series, and this is probably my favorite book in the series so far (although knowing me I probably said that about another one of the books in the series). I loved how much this book made me laugh, but also how much it had me wanting to know what was going to happen next, I really was sitting on the edge of my chair for some of this book.

They obviously have the sort of love she can only dream of--the love she thought she had before the divorce. But she's not bitter. Not like her boss. Really she's not. And a love like theirs deserves a heart-shaped cake, whatever her evil boss might think of hearts.

A quick dusting of precious sweetness from the sweet old couple's tin and the cake's complete, till Rhea's boss walks in. Then dreams turn to nightmares, in more ways than one, and Rhea's out on the street looking for another job.

There are some pleasingly disconcerting details in this short story as Rhea learns more than she ever wanted about secrets of the male anatomy. But the secrets she needs to learn are her own desires, and it's not her fault her guides prove so inept.

There's more to life than wishes after all, and more to the future than the past. This story should please as long as you're in the mood to have your emotions twisted first. I really enjoyed it.

Sebastien is vain and selfish-not maliciously so, just unaware of others outside his little bubble. He treats life like a game, never taking things seriously, until his sparkling world of superficial beauty is stripped from him in a violent way.

Marin grew up in the same world as Sebastien but she's tired of the fakeness. She's ready to settle down and have something tangible-a relationship and possibly a family. While Sebastien looks good to her, he's too young and immature for what she's wanting-or so she thinks.

Sebastien matured a lot in this story and it was an interesting journey to read about after all his antics in previous books. He went from very superficial to downright responsible and personable to others besides his family. He's full of charisma and charm, even when he was brooding, and I liked how his character developed over the course of the series.

Marin fell flat for me.  She didn't really come to life until the very end of the book when she finally admitted what she wanted!  Marin's lack of confidence in herself and her place in Sebastien's life made me want to smack her! When she said Sebastien was too immature for her..the irony of her statement was apparent seeing how she handles their interlude through most of the story. Instead of just being upfront with Sebastien and taking his words at face value, she kept questioning and self doubting to the point where I wanted to grab a shovel and help Marin dig the hole she was burying herself into!

While not the strongest entry in the Barnes brothers series, RUINED was still a decent read.  There are a few surprises, some angst, and plenty of humor to stay entertained until the end.

We have grown to love Chase and Ari over the last year, and their conclusion is just as amazing as the ride we have taken with them. Isabelle has wrote characters for everyone to love. We have the All American girl, and the All American Boy. Her stories has so much laughter and angst to give it the perfect recipe.

We have watched these two go through so much together. I didn't ever think they would get their crap together, but they did and I couldn't be happier. But when you are at your highest, someone always try's to knock you down. Chase is going to go through some serious issues in this book, and their relationship will be tested once again. But, our Ari is a fighter and that girl doesn't ever quit. Their love is unconditional, and their devotion to each other is astounding. Together they can make anything happen. So much goes on in this book, so now I know why Isabelle had to do a Novel. There is no way their ending could be written as a Novella. And, honestly I'm so happy this was a long book. I am going to miss them tremendously. I can't wait until we get Spencer and Charlie's story, cause that girl is a firecracker!!

Isabelle~ Thank you so much for the amazing characters you write in your books.(Not Just Love/Hate). Your characters are witty, smart, and ones that you can't help but to fall in love with. They are captivating and always leaves me wanting more of them. I'm ready for your next big journey, and I can't wait to come along for the ride.",...

Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author and Booklover Catlady Publicity in return for a fair and honest review.
Many thanks!

It's not often that a book or story chills me to my very core. I've read some incredibly scary stories and had goosebumps left in its wake. Yet
Bled by Eddie Slain left me shivering with uncomfortable tension and artfully sculpted terror.

Bled is a crime thriller/serial killer tale that takes place during the holidays. Cassie is a young woman caught in a deadly game, where sex
and violence often become intertwined. In Charleston, Illinois, Cassie and Frank engage in a bloody tryst, leaving Frank to limp away battered
and angry. Needing a change of view and to get away from a destructive relationship, Cassie flies to Italy, where she falls for a new stranger
who lights a fire in her heart. Yet the violence and pain of her past quickly catch up to her, and she is left to fight for not only her life,
but the life of her new lover.

Now this is definitely a book I would recommend for adults who can handle sexually descriptive scenes. The horror of death and murder are easily
combined with the sensuous and dangerous exploits of the characters, and the characters are well developed. The descriptive nature of the scenes
and the settings make the book really come to life, playing like a film in the mind. This is a truly horror filled novel, and not only is there
a great twist ending, but it brings to life some truly dark characters that I've seldom read before. If you enjoy graphic, truly chilling stories,
then Bled by Eddie Slain is the book for you!","A Dark, Chilling Read...",1451001600,,

This book is Finn and Meg's story.
Finn is a troubled man who can't let his rough past go. By the age of seventeen he has fought for his life, lost the girl he swore to protect and lost his newborn son. He left Austrialia to put all that behind him but the nightmares wouldn't go away. He found his way to Jasper Bay and the Nordic Lords where he finally found a family but that still didn't help the pain he held.
Meg is a friend of Ryker. VP of the Nordic Lords. When her and her sons life are threatened by someone her late husband owed money to she left New Orleans heading to Jasper Bay, knowing Ryker would keep them safe.
While Ryker tries to figure out how to get the man responsible for the threat he assigns Finn to watch and protect Meg and Braydon her son. The probelm with this for Finn is he is very attracted to Meg but he feels he is to damaged for her, and being around her son reminds him of what he lost.
Can Finn and Meg put the past behind them? Can their attraction for each other and what they are starting to feel, help heal them?

On the night of graduation, sandy realizes that while they still want different things, she is attracted to him. One thing leads to another and they end up sleeping together. Now for Hunter, it's a dream come true; the love of his life is finally his, or so he thinks.

Jaime is a Master to suicidal women and men, he has had his eye on Lydia for a while. When she finally makes the decision to end her life Jaime steps in to see if he can help her. Putting his life in grave danger, he saves her, only to find out that she dropped off the radar while he was recovering from saving her.
Months later when he manages to find her, he can see that her situation hasn't gotten much better, and he knows he may be her only hope to stay in this world. And he needs her to stay. Death cannot have Lydia, because Jaime wants her for himself and he will do things he has never done before to make her see in herself, what he sees in her.

Watching the struggles that both Jaime and Lydia go through to battle depression and suicidal thoughts caught me and reeled me in like a fish. While this story may be a trigger for some people, I found it refreshing and believable.

Michelle, was a hard ass but she had to be, being a female vamp and all. I admired her struggle between totally dominating Aaron or letting him grow as a vampire, she took the right path. The love scenes...heck not love...hot erotic sex had me riveted.

Carson Black writing as Margaret Falk is a rambling mystery that places a group of Hollywood characters in the Arizona desert. (And I need to add a minor SPOILER ALERT.)
Alex Cafarelli arrives in a remote desert hotel, not far from her home in Tucson, in response to a call for help from her childhood friend. The friend, Caroline Arnet, is a mega movie star appearing in the play being filmed on location, and is fearful for her life. The request is strange because the two have not seen each other in several years. However, Alex, whose parents were some of the wandering `hippies' so prominent in society for a time, feels that she `owes' Caroline for her help in their early school years.
The day after the two women meet, Caroline is killed, on the day of her birthday, during a scene where live ammunition has replaced blanks in a pistol used in a scene. From here the plot evolves into discerning whether the exchange was a mistake or murder and questions whether an ensuing death is murder or suicide. The action involves the local sheriffs, members of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, Caroline's husband, a producer who was believed to be in Africa until his unannounced arrival for her birthday. Other members of the cast and filming crew, an eccentric hotel owner, and a number of other local characters complete the cast.
The plot is acceptable and the pace adequate to make a decent mystery. The presentation of the Hollywood characters also is a more realistic presentation than usual. My problems are:  Often, when beginning a new chapter, there is a need to orient oneself to the subject in hand. The love interest appears to be too casually developed to be real, perhaps  because the Alex and Nick characters never are really `fleshed out'.  Many of Alex's actions and reactions are difficult to accept, especially when she is supposedly `at home in wilderness' and other similar settings where there is a need for self-reliance. Additionally, she would not need to await film development to see if her wildlife pictures depicted what she wanted. She would examine the tracks in the area. Another character, Maybelle, would not have ""left her pistol in the truck"". There would have been no reason to have removed it and most western holsters have a `tie-down' to keep them from being lost. It also is difficult to believe a number of investigative details; e.g., a check on Ted's flights.
To conclude, The Desert Waits can be enjoyed as an involved mystery as long as the reader is not bothered by the features mentioned. Reviewed by John H. Manhold, award winning fiction/nonfiction author.","Pleasantly readable, but with flaws",1324771200,,

But not just a club where partners act out their desires, one where the women come with a price tag. But when life hands you lemons, you toss those away and kneel instead.

Okay. I don't even know where to start. I really enjoy BDSM themed erotica serials and novels. I like the different aspects authors focus on as they tell their story. But I cant even. Club Taboo is more of a brothel than a sex club. Even if Patrick is expected to be an experienced Dom that is kind... where the heck was the talk of limits and safewords?

Roxy is a breath of fresh air as a character.  She is likeable, down to earth, funny, a bit insecure and prone to blurting out things she'd much rather have stayed in her head as many, many of us have done a time or several dozen so most folks can easily relate to her.

Dominic may just be the nameless, faceless man that many of us ladies have daydreamed at one point or another of having in our lives, but Heidi was smart enough to let him have flaws and not make him too perfect because then it might have been easy to dislike him.

Joley McBride and Nate Garrigan were both caught in a situation not of their making. However Nate was attracted to Joley but thought she was in love with her business partner Patrick. They were at the wedding of Patrick and Nate's half-sister Gabby who is also Joley's friend.  She isn't in love with Patrick or with anyone else since she fell in love with a married man (didn't know it at time) while in college. It shook her confidence in herself and has colored her relationships ever since but her mother Ella reminds her that time if marching on. At 31 she has sort of given up on love. Nate also had his heart broken when he wife of 3 months ran off; couldn't take life on a cattle station.  So Joley now finds out the flight school her father founded which she and Patrick are partners in is bankrupt; Patrick made unwise purchases and is pretty much sticking them. (Not sure why Joley stills considers Patrick a friend) Anyhow Nate has bought Patrick out at Gabby's insistence. They're off on a 2 week honeymoon and Joley gets caught coming out of Nate's hotel room next morning after the wedding. Now Nate makes Joley an offer she feels she need to take; come to my ranch (this is in Australia by the way) for a month.  Then you can have your flight school cleared of debt and your father doesn't have to know since it would break his heart.  It sounds melodramatic but the author does a good job of making Nate and Joley's arrangement/relationship work. Of course her mother is thrilled; rich, handsome landowner cha ching.  It is a good realistic story where Joley meets some very nice and sweet people in Mulhany Crossing. She comes to like the laid back life style and ranch hands.

After her main bout had eased, the author jumped into the ring and took care of her husband as his cancer became active once again. Even as I felt the devastation wrought by their experiences, I also felt hopefulness, cheering with them throughout.

Its not an easy read at all, but Theraults memoir is riveting for its poignancy. I experienced her dance with denial, feeling her anger and despair as the blinders came off regarding her own cancer. It was stirring to read the segments where her anger shifted, and instead, turned into a fierce desire to fight this cancer, no holds barred. During each step of her treatment, Therault clearly defines and explains tests, surgeries, procedures, lab results, and medications. Often, I cringed at the awfulness she went through. At the same time, however, shed have me marveling at her strength and resilience. Even more engaging was openness. Throughout the memoir, Therault let me have a front row seat into her thoughts and emotions, the gritty anger and despair, and the wittiness that always led her back into hopefulness.

There were places in which the writer in me noted some grammatical issues. However, these did not detract at all from the quality of my read. After all, this was Theraults memoir, a very intimately-written account of her experience with stage III ovarian cancer and her husbands bone marrow cancer.

I highly recommend this memoir to anyone who is coping with cancer and to their loved ones. For myself, I gained an immense appreciation for the depth of courage that it takes for anyone to go through an experience of treatment for cancer.","A candid, riveting memoir",1427673600,,

Stein mentioned to me when I was chatting with her at the E-book Expo that her novella, Cloud City was going to be available for FREE during the convention. So later that night I made sure to download this one. Can pass up free now can you?

It was a pretty good story too! Sophie Deveraux, Belinda Burke's sister, needs Anna's help. She still houses the vampire ghost Jonathan inside of her and he's decided that he wants to write a book about this life! I mean, who doesn't want to read a vampire book these days? Plus it's about a real vampire too! But things start to get a little dicey. Sophie isn't too sure of their editor who wants to publish the book.

Turns out the editor knows more about Jonathan that Sophie thought. Apparently, Jonathan turned his great grandmother into a vampire years ago, essentially ruining their family name and all that jazz. He wants revenge. Anna is there for backup and protection, but it turns out Sophie has other plans than just trying to help Jonathan with his book and keep his...or her head. Sophie is going to get Jonathan once and for all and get her life back.

Anna is sort of concerned because she thinks Sophie might be taking the same dark path that her sister, Belinda took awhile back. But Sophie is so determined to get rid of Jonathan, she wants to be in control of her life and not have to share it with him, no matter what benefits housing the spirit of a once vampire may have.

This was a nice quick read. Very enjoyable, but isn't one of those that really ties itself into the series. Like not reading this novella won't leave you confused in a book in the series. This was purely just a fun read!

Mac is morning the murders of hiswife and daughter and of course becomes a raving alcoholic.  While Jade confronts an violent man in a car, Mac is too drunk to assist.  Jade justifiably kills the man and Mac is booted from the force.  Five years later, their roles are reversed and she is Mac's training officer.

3.5 Stars!!

This is the second book in the series and focuses on Drea and Brody's story. These two are as different as night and day, but there is undeniable sexual chemistry displayed at every turn. These two argue a lot, but that just leads to some sexy and explosive making up.

I really enjoyed the relationship between these two. I thought that they were a great match, and I liked that it developed naturally over time. I was able to fully enjoy their connection and the sweet moments these two shared together.

It took Brody a bit to commit to the idea of a relationship because he had been abandoned by his mother as a child. On the other hand, Drea was attached at the hip to her mother as her caretaker, and just wanted someone to love and appreciate her. What she got in Brody was something better.

I enjoyed this book for the most part but found the suspense part of the story line to be unnecessary. It was confusing, not something I would have expected in a million years, and not something that I found interesting. There was too much going on with it, and parts of it were highly unrealistic. I feel like this story could have stood alone as simply a romance.

Overall, I would recommend this book. The characters were enough to keep me engaged even when I didn't really like or understand parts of the story.",Undeniable chemistry and a perfect match up...,1463875200,,

The primary male character, Damien, is an overbearing alpha male almost to the extreme-controlling and domineering...as well as hot, sexy, mouthwatering...you get the idea, right?  In sharp contrast is Etta, our lead female character.  A sweet, accommodating and naive young girl just turning 18 who honestly is not really mature enough and strong enough to handle the relationship she falls into with Damien.

Etta's character came across as extremely weak and not able to stand up for herself.  Because of these character flaws, when she gets involved with Damien he winds up controlling everything.  And while the two of them have totally unreal physical chemistry (and the steamy sex scenes that you'll find throughout the book are a solid testament to that), that's really all I can see that they have.  The two of them feel it is something stronger than love, something more, but I just didn't see how it could be anything but lust and obsession on a physical level.

Then there's Aaron.  Sweet, wonderful, helpful, loving Aaron who truly loves Etta and is willing to wait for her.  *sigh*

I thought the writing itself was good, the story did flow well and kept me interested.  And the tension that built and came to a head at the end along with the bit of a cliffhanger had me wanting to dive into the next two books to see both possible resolutions.

What holds me back from giving more than the 3.5 stars that I'm rating this first installment is Etta's character.

I had actually never heard of the Bryant & May series when I saw this short story listed on NetGalley.  I am always on the lookout for a new mystery series so I decided to read this short piece as a way of sampling the author's writing and try to get a feel for the series.  This story was really short but enjoyable.

This story is part of the Bryant & May series which is a long standing detective series.  I doubt that anything in the short story will end up being important to the series but it was a nice episode in Bryant & May's caseload.  There really wasn't much of a mystery to be solved but it was really interesting to see how they went about solving the case.

This story focuses on the death of an 11 year old boy just outside a department store.  Bryant and May are called in to investigate the death.  They focus on the store's Santa since the boy had just visited with Santa before running from the store.  There were a couple of pieces that needed to be fit together in order to solve the mystery.

I liked the way the writing in this story flowed.  The main characters were just wonderful.  They had a camaraderie that was a lot of fun.  Their personalities really complimented each other well.  I would imagine that long time fans of the series will want to pick this one up just to spend a few minutes with Bryant & May.

I would recommend this story to both long time readers of the series and the inexperienced like myself.  I would definitely be interesting in checking out one of the full length books in the series after reading this story.

Gage Gatlin and his daughter, Lucy was looking for a homestead or ranch in which to finally settle down. Gage knew that love was a fairy tale but there was something about Sarah that drew him. His meeting with Sarah was momentous, about to change his life and disrupt it.

Agnieszka is a young woman who has grown up in the shadow of the Dragon's tower and in the shadow of the Wood which is filled with danger and corruption. Each ten years the Dragon picks a seventeen-year-old girl to be his servant. At the end of that time, the girl doesn't come back to the valley. Everyone knows that the Dragon will be picking Agnieszka's best friend Kasia who is beautiful, brave, and talented -- but everyone is wrong.

Agnieszka has to find her way in the Dragon's tower when she never expected to be there. She also finds herself reluctantly learning magic and, even more reluctantly, getting involved in the bigger political picture. The Wood captures her friend Kasia and, despite it never happening before, Agnieszka manages to recover her from the Wood and clean her of the Wood's corruption. But Kasia is greatly changed by the experience. When Prince Marek learns that Kasia has been rescued, he pursuades (actually it is closer to blackmail) Agnieszka and the Dragon to attempt to rescue his mother, the Queen, who was stolen more than 20 years before.

This one has everything. It has a feisty heroine who isn't going to do anything the conventional way and who has a fierce loyalty to those she loves. It has a mysterious wizard who is tasked with keeping the Wood away from the human lands. It has a prince who will do anything and pay any price to rescue his mother.

I actually read this book a while ago. Read it, blew up Val's phone with my ranting, and then pretty much dominated our next phone conversation ranting about this book.

It wasn't even disappointing. It was INFURIATING.

But why? I should probably explain that.

Well. First of all. When I grabbed this book, there was no indication--NONE, zero, zilch, nada--of this being book 1 in a series (or trilogy or whatever it is). Not on Amazon, not in the synopsis, not even on Goodreads. Since then, this has changed. But then? I went into this expecting a standalone. Now, I don't hate series or anything. I mean, duh. Series are great. But THIS BOOK being the first in a series. Makes me mad. I'll get to why in a minute.

Second of all, that synopsis is a dirty liar. The first part, with the car accident? I was interested in that. I started this book to get to that. It seemed like it'd be emotional and interesting and hit me in the feels, ya know? OH WAIT NOPE. That part doesn't even happen until like 80% into the book--possibly farther. As I said, I read this book a while ago. It took me all that time in between to chill out enough to write this review. But I digress. That second part of the synopsis, about turning to Johnny? OH WAIT NOPE. This book is not about turning to Johnny for help. Or dealing that that car accident that seems so instrumental.

This book, my friends, is a LEAD ON into the rest of the books. It is all of the background information that is boring to read. It is setting up the troubled past we usually get the summarized version of in books. It starts where Cat (I seriously just had to check the synopsis for her name because I couldn't remember it) and Johnny meet. And then we're walked through that all the way through graduating high school.

Honestly, if this had been done well I probably wouldn't be so mad about this. Except it wasn't. It was done lazily. The characters were so flat, and the voice of this book was nonexistent. It was monotone. I felt nothing. The writing, the story Cat was telling, got literally nothing out of me, except anger once I reached the end of the book. It was as if the terrible situations Cat was in were supposed to be enough to create a reaction out of me. Only problem was that I didn't care about Cat in the first place.

And then. AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN.

There is a cliffhanger.

So there's this whole, boring, backstory book that should really just be a prequel and stop pretending anything else... and then we're left with this big, enraging cliffhanger. I don't want to go into spoilers (because you may want to read it, though I don't recommend it), but the way the entire thing was executed FELT like a ploy. Read this first book of boring, get to the end, and then BAM--DON'T YOU WANT TO READ ON TO GET TO THE HAPPY ENDING AND FIND THINGS OUT???

No. I don't. I never will.

And looking at the next two books, I know I'd just be swimming in more anger, so it's really a great thing I have no interest in finding out what will happen. I mean, besides the obvious...considering the books are NAMED AFTER Johnny, I can only assume how things will turn out...

Sigh.

I don't want it to seem like I'm hating on this book because there was a cliffhanger. That's not it. I read books with cliffhangers all the time and love them. I love series and reading on and all that fun stuff. So the cliffhanger isn't really the problem here, it was just my breaking point when it came to this book. The problem I have with this book is:
- flat characters
- lazily written, boring story
- attempt at emotional blackmail that was a fail
- the complete lie of a synopsis
- having to wait at least 80% of the book for half the synopsis to even happen
- terrible, non-swoon-worthy romance (you know how important romance is to me!)
- boring falling apart between characters
- nonexistent character growth
- ...AND THEN AN ANNOYING, USELESS, INFURIATING CLIFFHANGER

You see my point? There was all that stuff, and then it was topped off with a cliffhanger. Felt like a slap in the face. Thus, I got mad and ranty.

Sigh.

Overall, Johnny is normally a name I love. This book put a dent in that. I did not enjoy this book at all. I wasted two hours of my life on this book, and I regret every second.

I'll admit to being a sucker for that story line, but Shatter Me had so much more going on than that.

The returnee, Alex, watched his best friend die in the war trying to protect him, and, as a result, has a massive case of survivor guilt, especially since he's always been attracted to Reagan, his widow, and she to him. Both kept their mutual attraction private. The widow isn't having an easy time of it, even 18 months after burying her husband, when Alex decides to keep his promise to his fallen comrade, and check in on her.

Reagan has been keeping a big secret--her husband had a dark side. He was physically and mentally abusive. Dying a hero's death, he's now being lionized by their small town as a war hero.  After attempting to get help and understanding from her sister-in-law, she wasn't believed and the woman did everything she could to turn Reagan into the town pariah. After that, she especially want to keep her abuse from his best friend, who idolized the man and still feels as though he was one who should have died. She doesn't want to tarnish her abuser's memory. You care for these characters, you feel their pain, and I'll admit to shedding a few tears myself.

Review from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.
This book is a little outside my usual genre, its NA and romance, but the content is very different to whats mostly available in the NA market Its not a buy meets girl HEA, sweet book, but one where the participants meet after having been convicted of a crime, and have opted to let a machine judge whether they live or die. The Compass Room is a sort of futuristic moral compass which takes their reactions to simulated events and judges them, there's no trial, no prison, participants either go free  very unlikely  or die there and then.
Its something that could well happen at some point in the future, as we begin to rely more and more on technology as the answer to everything. The computer never lies we hear over and over, and yet..it's totally  dependent on what info is programmed in. We've currently lie detectors, fingerprinting and retina scanners, DNA tests, all supposedly tamper and foolproof, but one wonders, are they human tamper proof from the other end? Are we right to depend so much on the results? This book shows very chillingly what could happen if we take things too far.
Its quite horrific and graphic in parts, and for a wimpy weed like me that's hard to take, and I had to skim some parts. I felt the story too was a bit choppy for me, I wanted to know what it was Evalyn had done, wanted to know why others reacted as they did, and more about each person as a person not just their crimes. I didn't really connect with this book, more because of my needs though, than because its not a good book. I'm sure those who like this genre will love it  I was looking at the romance, and that's just a very small part of the whole, with the rest being the CR and its actions, where my fears over the future of technology and realism meant I didn't enjoy that part.
Clearly there's more to come, and despite not really enjoying this book it has got me hooked in some ways, as I really want to know what happens to them next, and what happens about the Compass Room. Its pro iced at 2.49, and though I didn't have page/kb info Id guess from location number and time it took to be about 120  150 pages.
Stars: three, a read that was really well written, but sadly was not quite what I enjoy. Remember as ever thats a personal opinion, and not a reflection of book and plot quality

17-year-old Madly is a mermaid princess. She's going to school in a place called Slumber with her friends Aidan and Jersey, and everything is fine until one day she gets a shooting pain in her arm and head, and the pearl on her wrist turns black. Investigating, Madly finds out that the reason for this is that several `fairytale' character prisoners have escaped from the jail in her home town of Atlas, and are holding her family hostage. Now it's up to Madly to find a way to recapture the prisoners and save her family.

I enjoyed this book, although it's really more like the opening few chapters of a book rather than a  story in its own right (there's no end as such), it's more a bit of a teaser for Madly and Wolfhardt.

It became evident that he left and became a pirate however he is freshly pardoned now for his works as a privateer and returns home to his wife...and her three children.  Now a strong man, Griffin is ready for a true marriage with his lovely wife, even in spite of her evident betrayal.  Phoebe is shocked to see Griffin back home and upsetting her perfectly ordered life and is furious that he thinks her a trollop!  Hopefully a little communication will clear all this up. . .

What a fun novella!  An absolute delight.  It is short yet full of Eloisa James wit and charm and I read this in one sitting.  Yes Phoebe and Griffin fall in love (as they really did not know each when they were married and never really spent any time together) rather quickly.  And yes there is cheating on Griffin's part during his pirate past (which is all off book)...but even with that I really adored this story.  I loved how Griffin reacts to Phoebe's children and I thought he handled the situation remarkably well.  I loved how Griffin did not even know his wife's true name....priceless!  There even is a new bond formed between Griffin and his father that adds a nice warm layer of family.  For 99 cents, you can't go wrong with this one!  A delightful re-acquaintance romance with charm, humor, family, acceptance, romance and a dash of heat.  4 stars

The Living Heartwood Series focuses on heartbreak, deep emotional pain, and the scars that living life can give us.  Yet, it also focuses on resiliency, and the ability to use inner strength to create a beautiful life out of the ashes and darkness of that pain.  In Losing Track, the sequel in the living heartwood series, we get Melody (Mel) and Boone's story.  Mel lives a life of addiction and excess.  She frequently does blow and gets drunk to the point where she can't function.  She grew up seeing her dad do it, and all of her close friends also have the same lifestyle.  Her dad was in a Motorcycle Club, and even though she is not an official part of the club, they are still her family.  Her best friend Darla is like a sister to her.  The two of them do everything together, and Mel is use to guiding and protecting Darla.  One horrible night leads Mel to be put in to an addiction rehabilitation facility where she will go through withdrawals, counseling, and be forced to deal with the ghosts in her past.  She's counting down the days till she gets released, but what will happen when she's out in the real world?

Boone use to have a serious drug addiction, which lead to a painful tragedy that turned his whole life around.  Now, he abstains from alcohol, drugs, and even sex.  However, to deal with his heavy burdens of guilt and pain, he participates in backyard fights, where people illegally gamble on who will win.  This is the only relief that he gets from the pain that he carries inside of himself.  As part of his probation, Boone speaks at the Stoney Rehabilitation Facility, and tells the story of how he hit rock bottom.  However, he doesn't tell the real story, because it is too painful for him.  While speaking, he catches sight of Mel, and is instantly attracted to the pain that he see's in her eyes.  He can relate, and even though he has steered clear of the opposite sex for quite a while; he can't resist her.

Mel and Boone share an attraction, but it's way more than that.  They see themselves in each other.  As they begin spending more time together, a friendship blossoms from their mutual pain.  Little by little, they begin to share their secrets with one another, and rely on each other for strength and friendship.  As romance and love begins to develop, they both question if two addicts with such painful pasts can live happily ever after.

Losing Track was a dark, gritty, and painful, but very truthful story.  Ms. Wolfe took me in to the minds of Mel and Boone.  I experienced both of their deep-rooted pain, guilt, and daily emotional battles.  These characters were authentic.  It felt like I was reading a true account on both of their lives.  Losing Track took me to a very dark place; one where you realize that every action we take will put us on a certain path, and give us a certain consequence.  This story also gave me a sense of hope, that no matter what happens in life, we are resilient, and can live a life with meaning.

My Rating:

I give Losing Track, by Trisha Wolfe 4.5 Deep-Rooted Pain, Resilient, Intimate, and Emotional Stars!  If you love Jessica Sorensen, you should read the Living Heartwood Series.  You will be able to relate to the fact that we all have major life challenges, and emotional scars, but it's important to not give up.  The human spirit is resilient!

My Favorite Quote:

""Actions have consequence.  Even if in your darkest dreams you could've never predicted the pain, the hurt, the loss--every action has an equal and opposite counter reaction.  That's the law of physics, but it's also the words that thrum through me daily.""  (eARC, Loc. 2925)

It's a cute story.  If the characters just talked about their feels there would not have been a story.  When Aiden and Hailey finally realize they are on the same page with their relationship, it's great.  I loved the ending and it's not a cliffhanger.

More with You is a quick read.  Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.",A good read!,1392681600,,

Lawrence C. Ross delivers a well-researched, timely, and critical call-to-action message in his latest: BLACKBALLED: The Black and White Politics of Race on Americas Campuses --harsh truths--universities must make radical changes to their policies and standards, in order to continue to provide education and a better college life environment, for both black and whites--no longer can they bury their head in the sand. Be proactive, versus reactive.

Campus racism crisis has been at epidemic proportions for decades, and it is time for predominately white colleges and universities to start looking for effective solutions, before a tragic event erupts., which is already happening. Blackballed rips the scab off the open secret; predominately white college campuses, are hostile spaces for black students.

From the great Nigerian Novelist Chinua Achebean African proverb: Until the lions have their own historian, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter. Blackballed is written from the lion's point. A change is critical and the truth must be told.

Racism isn't just something that you overcome. Ross proposes the question: Is racism simply in the eyes and ears of many, an unfortunate but inconsequential aspect of life?

If you have kept abreast with the headline news, it has already begun. In his controversial and insightful book, Ross stresses, every college and university in the US is a ticking time bomb. The first step is to address racism on campus-- ""Admit the sickness"" and work towards getting healthyas a societal cancer. What is the treatment?

Blackballed points out how colleges and universities have historically either been complicit in fostering a campus environment that was friendly to racist behavior, or reacted so superficially that they made the conditions worse. Why do programs not succeed?

For the same reason why anti-racism efforts tend to fail in general society; we don't address them honestly, with the full resources available. Ross brings up some thought-provoking points:

Creating a racism-free environment on college and university campus isn't as large a priority, as making sure the donors are happy, the football team is winning, and the tuition money keeps flowing.

Everything else is superfluous, and a result, the black students suffer. Black athletes are recruited for their schools. Football is more important than culture of diversity and positive changes to the campus. Everyone wants the football team to do well. African American football players---their place is on the field--not in the frat house. Injustice. This could be used as leverage.

Similar to Jeanne Marie Laskas' Concussion Dr. Bennet Omalu, the pathologist who made one of the most significant medical discoveries of the twenty-first century. Everyone pimps out the football players from pop warner to the NFL, and leaves them to deal with CTE, mental illness, and the fallout--all with a blind eye. Sadly, America is about power and greed.

Blackballed addresses public policy, anti-affirmative action, black history, civil rights, and specifically, the injustice of fraternities and sororities. As Blackballed shows, it may be easier for a black man to sit in the White House, than in a University of Alabama fraternity house.

While most of the campus racist incidents involve white fraternities and sororities, the question proposed: How could white millennials (a post-racial) generation who never experienced the separate-but-equal world of Jim Crow segregation, know the racial songs designed to dehumanize and humiliate African Americans? When it comes to racism at colleges and universities, we are not a generation moving closer to a nation without racism. This is sad.

Racism is as common at Americas universities as pretty cheerleaders.

Have things really changed since the 1920s-1950s? The question: Where did all of these racist incidents come from? Did they ever stop in the first place?

Not isolated incidents, but longstanding traditions. Greek row, and how they function on college campuses. Some blame on society itself. Parents spend thousands of dollars to send their children to college, and many of them are subject to daily humiliation. Not only blacks, there are other minorities, injusticeand some say social media has made it more prominent.

Ross has chronicled a two-year journey he believes discussing these issues is important, a platform, and a means for voices to be heard. Changes have to be made.

Blackballed is not about predominately white institutions (PWis) not having a role in educating black college students. For over a century, black students have received invaluable educations at these white colleges and universities have gone on to change American and the world. Black students will continue to enroll, graduate, and change lives while influenced by their educations at these schools.

By providing these opportunities to African American college students, does not mitigate the racism that these students will face on nearly every campus in the US. Ross stresses we should not confuse the coping mechanisms black students use to survive on these campuses with long-lasting solutions.

However, at the root of Blackballed is a cry for help --These students are under attack in a hostile environment. A critical need to move campus racism from the backwaters of their administrators to the forefront. Triple budgets for diversity education. Radical change within the fraternity and sorority systems with comprehensive anti-racism plans from national headquarters to teach organizations and hold them accountable. No more excuses, we didn't know. Making students and leaders cognizant of the complexities of race and racism.

In the end, a complex question---given all the racial obstacles, going to a predominately white institution-- is it really worth it for African Americans? Of course, their education is valuable; however, more importantly every parent and student may ask, is it worth the psychological damage due to racism? The book is not saying blacks should not go to college; however, should they give up going to predominately white universities and instead attend black schools, or should they fight it out and demand a racism-free environment?

Powerful and timely. Highly recommend for administrators, students, and parents of all studentsregardless of color. Education on the subject is critical. We are not powerless. Confront campus racism. Making the comfortable, uncomfortable.

In further reading, most say the racial harassment is not unprecedented. Take young men and women living away from home the first time, off to college; no parental control or supervision, combined with racially divided campuses, fueled with alcohol and drugs, plus thrown together with other unfamiliar ethnic groups, hormones, social media, added peer pressure, and lack of education in the social world---all compound the problem.

Being aware of these issues, classes, or further education is needed to address the problems. Administrators, colleges, universities, and students have to be held accountable. After all folks, this is year 2016, not the 1950's. We are leaving these students hanging--not a great foundation for adulthood, the workplace and future generationsif not addressed at this level or before, it will only multiple.","A well-researched, timely, and critical call-to-action message.

85824,5,False,"12 1, 2011",A25OT2WVEKP6HR,B005WJJMQW,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},"READING, EATING &amp;amp; DREAMING","There is a little game I like to play before I read a novel. This is how you play: Read synopsis. Guess plot. Read novel. Compare guesstimated plot with the real plot. If you guessed right then you win; if you guessed wrong then you lose. I LOST, and I am so GLAD! I really thought I had Catching Jordan all figured out, but this story wasn't predictable. At least, I couldn't have guessed it. Plus, the actual storyline was way better than what I guesstimated. Now, that's all I am going to say on that because I don't want to ruin anything.

Did I mention that my absolute favorite movie growing up was The Little Giants? I think I've seen it a bazillion times over the years. I loved the girl playing football with all the boys, how she was their leader and captain, all the camaraderie between the players, and of course you can't forget, the cute new boy in town. Catching Jordan by Miranda Kenneally had all of that and a lot more.

The characters in this novel are entertaining, and their relationships are unique. Jordan and her father have a rocky relationship. Her dad's an NFL player who supports his son's collegiate football career and all of Jordan's teammates, but he doesn't support Jordan. But Jordan has her mom, her brother, her three best friends, and her teammates for support. Jordan and her friends are extremely close, and her teammates always have her back. Everyone on the team looks up to Jordan; she is their leader and captain. They respect her, they protect her, and they stand up for, even though she is a girl.

It took me a little while to get all of the characters down. The characters are called by their first names, their last names, and some of them have two first names: Sam Henry (I swear I am not a dumb blonde, but it took me a little bit to get that one all straightened out). I was trying to figure out who Sam was and who Henry was. FYI: they are the same person ;)

Jordan is a one of a kind character. I don't think I'll ever find another character like her. She is so honest. When it comes to life and football, Jordan is strong and in control. She is a natural born leader. When it comes to boys and love, she is absofreakinlutely clueless.

JJ, Carter and Sam are Jordan's protectors and support system. The four of them are best friends. This novel would have been lacking if it weren't for these three boys. They are an important part of this story because they add entertainment, humor and romance to the story. Plus, they give some interesting insight into a boy's mind.

All of the characters felt genuine, except for Ty. I just wanted more from his character. He was a little all over the place. In my opinion, Ty's character fell flat. That is my only complaint about this novel.

I am a girly girl to the core. I love dresses, the color pink, poofy skirts, rhinestones, high heels, etc. I was a cheerleader in middle school and high school. As far as interests go, I would consider myself Jordan's polar opposite. That didn't stop me from loving and devouring this novel. I think you can be a girly girl, a tomboy, or even a boy and still appreciate this novel.
I don't, however, recommend this novel to people who absolutely hate football. Football is a big part of this novel, and you have to have at least some love for the game in order to appreciate this story. I graduated from LSU = SEC = BEST conference ever = Football is a big deal down here = I grew up with a love for the game. You don't have to be the biggest football fan ever to connect with this novel, but it helps if you are a fan. I feel like I must add: If I could change one thing about this novel it would be Jordan's dream football team. Alabama? Boo!

I gave Catching Jordan by Miranda Kenneally 5 STARS (4 STARS). This is a wonderful young adult novel about following your dreams and facing life's realities. Jordan says it best, ""Sometimes you have to give something up to get something better.""

MONTANA REUNION by author Soraya Lane is a January 2013 release.

Jack Gregory doesn't like the fact that his father was punishing him from the grave by decreeing that he has to marry to inherit the family ranch Jack loved.

But can he just marry anyone? Then he sees his childhood best friend Madison Jones who had moved away. He was intrigued. She had changed beyond recognisation from the girl into a beautiful woman and if he ever decided to marry, it would be to her.
Would she agree to marriage with him? And would their marriage be real?

MONTANA REUNION is a sweet, sensual story. It is a lively contemporary romance with a sexy, gorgeous hero you will swoon over and a strong heroine whom you'd love. Author Soraya Lane once again brought this sparkling tale of unexpected friendship turning into red-hot passion. It is humour with steamy sensuality and heart tugging pathos.

Benjamin Price is the guy that pulled himself up from nothing and now owns Lust Media; despite have become extremely wealthy, like millionaire wealthy, he still strives for more, like billionaire status. He doesn't do relationships and he especially doesn't do employees; for Kylie he will break all his rules.

The story is a 50 Shades type buy with its own unique twist and turns that leave the reader wanting more, a lot more.

The main characters were good, Benjamin clearly has chip on his shoulder, but he's an entertaining alpha-male. Kylie on the other hand, will have you screaming ""what is wrong with you?""; if you're doctor prescribes you meds for some psycological issues, you take them. Furthermore, she is often to neurotic and overly caught up in her head; which is okay, because we get background into why she is the way she is.

The supporting characters were amazing; the guys in the pit were like your classic computer, stoner nerds, that always have something very hilariously dumb, yet not so dumb to say. Of all the supporting characters my favorite was by far Mistress Alexis, she's a transgender that has been friends with Benjamin since they were kids and she was known as Alex. In every scene that she appears in, she basically steals the show, or the pages I should say.

Ms. Sparks has more in store for this series and I for one can't wait; especially after that ending, talk about a tease. The story was fun and entertaining, it might not be everyones cup of tea, but I found it enjoyable, so I will praise this book.

I wouldn't be that harsh.  I found the main character, Alex, to be detached from her surroundings, much like someone with a disorder, such as FAS might cause.

  Chase Tanner is a billionaire and owner of Hard Wear and Soft Wear jeans. His friends encourage him to take a vacation to Laketon. Chase has not been there in two years. Chase ends up meeting Kali in the hardware store. He notices she is wearing Soft Wear jeans. Hard Wear and Soft Wear jeans are for Doms and Subs. Chase is very attracted to Kali and finds a reason to meet up with her again. Kali is divorced. Her husband cheated on her saying he needed a younger woman because he decided he did want to have kids and kali was the wrong choice after all. Kali does not want to be interested in Chase because he is younger than her and she is expecting him to bore of her quickly. Kali and Chase end up going out a couple times because Chase does not give in easy. Then things start to happen around Kali. Someone is trying to scare her. Chase is trying to protect Kali and find out who is doing these things.

  This was a good book. The characters were strong and likable. This book had a great story line. It seemed to have a little of everything. It had romance, mystery, and action.

It's no secret that I fell in love with Benjamin Chambers in The Art of Letting Go. I loved the book, I loved the characters. I loved it all. I've said it a thousand times and will continue to do so. When I found out Anna was writing novellas from Ben's POV for some of the more important scenes from his relationship with Lilah, I was so thrilled I could have done cartwheels. This was a perfect start.

The Saving of Benjamin Chambers is a short novella that I absolutely devoured. I was sucked in from the first page and I thoroughly enjoyed finally getting inside Ben's head. From the pre-Lilah scenes to the first time he set eyes on a sad, beautiful girl that he was pulled towards, to the months until they actually met and experienced an immediate attraction to each other, the scenes and inner dialogue was great. Anyone who has experienced that type of immediate, intense attraction to another person will appreciate this story. Fans of The Art of Letting Go will fall even more in love with Ben if that's at all possible.

""She can thank me tomorrow or the day after that, or even the day after that because one thing is for sure, I am never letting that girl escape again.""

Ben is sweet, sexy and swoony. I loved having the opportunity to see the events of their first meeting from his perspective. His voice was convincing and discernible from Lilah's in the first novel. Anna did a fantastic job telling his story in this novella. This series has humor and heart and I can't wait for the next installment in their story, regardless whose perspective it's from.

Although I have not read the series, or any of Alexa Rileys previous books, I was able to appreciate the story.  Fall into Place is a novella consisting of two short stories about the children from the Taking the Fall series.

In the first story we meet Mary and Anthony. They have been been together since birth. They are soul mates. Anthony was put on this earth to love and protect Mary. He adoringly calls her princess, and he refuses to give into her lust until she finally meets him at the altar to say I do. Their relationship is sweet and adorable. Mary finally agrees to marry Anthony but she is not quite ready to tell her parents, so they take off for Vegas with Marys brother (who happens to be Anthonys partner) as their witness. Alexa Riley will make you believe in soul mates with this story. This soul-mate love story is entangled with the next story in the book which addresses Marys brother.

The second story is about Samuel and Anika. He's a bounty hunter, ands she's the runaway daughter of a Russian hit-man.  Shes not running from danger, just from overprotective parents.  While on the way to Vegas for Marys and Anthonys wedding,  Samuel and Anthony get a call to locate and detain Anika.  When Samuel sees the photo of Anika, he wants to catch her and keep her.  He is instantly in love. Samuel is just the guy Anika needsstrong, sexy, and financially successful.  She is a spitfire who can defend herselfat least against Samuel who isn't about to punch her back.

When the families all meet up for Thanksgiving, all the cats are let out of the bag.  While this would have been the perfect time for some story conflict, the parents all say aw shucks, and everyone lives happily ever after.  I think this final book in Alexa Rileys Taking the Fall series would have been much improved if the two separate short stories had been woven into one more complex story that culminated with a little parental strife that eventually was resolved.

Overall, a very quick, light-hearted, 3.5 star read.  The love stories are sweet and will make you feel good.

I've been a follower of Lauren Layne for a long time, starting back with the very first book of hers I read, Isn't She Lovely. I've always loved her character development, but this book was something else entirely. She didn't just build two characters for you to fall in love with. She built tension. She built angst. She built drama and lust and romance and a million other tiny, yet intricate details that sucked you in, surrounded you, and made this read feel like you were trudging through flood waters, clinging to the steering wheel with white knuckles, and falling back onto a grungy motel room bed. You didn't ride along with the characters. You WERE the characters.
As with all of Layne's books, this one was INCREDIBLY well written, fast paced, full of laughs, a few tears, and so much freaking warmth that I don't know if my heart can take it. Seriously... Can't. Take. It.
I'm one of those readers that can't wait to get to the end of the story so I can gush (and gush I did) but for the first time in a long time, I reached the last page and squealed/groaned/screamed (seriously, it wasn't a pretty noise) because I COULDN'T STAND the fact that it was over.
And THAT, my friends, is a sign of a good freaking book.
I'm still in that post-book haze, but as soon as that wears off, I know I'm going to want more. Luckily, I only have to wait until April for her next release, but that's still too far away. In fact... I'm not one to reread books, but Love Story just might merit another go-around.

That should tell you that this is going to be another gushing review, because . . . I loved it!  I freely admit that I am a huge fan of Ms. Connealys, so this review may lean a bit toward bias, though I always try to give a thoroughly honest review.  That being said, I did honestly love this book!
This book is the last in Mary Connealys Wild at Heart series and is Baileys book.  Ive been anticipating this one since reading the first, so I was super excited to receive it.  It grabbed my attention from the very first page and I read quickly, finishing it within a day.  I love that Marys books always make me laugh and this one is no exception.  I found myself in stitches more than once and just randomly grinning, probably causing a few people to question my sanity.  Shes doing something a bit different with this series, though.  These books are a bit more serious and cut a little bit closer to the heart.  I honestly adore this, because while I enjoy the fluff and laughter, if a book touches my heart, thats one Im going to remember.  Now, before I make it sound like a drag, it definitely isnt.  I was kept on the edge of my seat for most of the story, wondering what might happen next and how everything would work out.
Marys writing is, per usual, excellent.  I love the details and descriptions, but also simply her writing style.  Its unique in a way I cant really define, but that I know I enjoy.  The dialogue is also a blast, both the verbal and internal.  I love knowing her characters thoughts, because they so crack me up with their bluntness and just the fact that they're thinking what most people would never say but definitely never admit.  She paints lovely (and hysterical) pictures with her words, to the point that I could almost imagine I was right there with Bailey and Gage.  I love being so thoroughly swept into a story and Marys books do that.
I hate to play favorites, but I think Bailey Wilde has been my favorite sister from the start.  Shes the mysterious one that plays at being a man and is willing to fight toe-to-toe with anyone who would dare threaten her sisters.  Even if I didn't love her before this book, I do now.  I enjoyed getting to really know her and see another side of her character.  She comes to life within pages of her story.  She isn't quite as tough as shes led everyone to believe, but she is fierce and a force to be reckoned with.  Beyond that though, is a hurting woman who has faced war and lived to tell about it.  One of my favorite parts of her story is when we finally get to know what haunts her and understand who she truly is behind her mask.
Gage Coulter . . . Im not sure what to say about him.  Stubborn fills in a lot of gaps.  Thickheaded.  Tenacious.  But on the flip side, once you get past his cranky exterior he is very caring toward Bailey and her family.  Even when they're driving him batty (though that was often mutual).  Gage is one of those heroes that I loved, but also wanted to slap at the same time.  So I sympathized with Bailey quite easily.  Beyond his annoying qualities, he is actually quite likable and I had to laugh and agree with many of his observations.
I also enjoyed the bit of mystery thats woven throughout, keeping me guessing as to what might happen next.  Its actually downplayed a bit from the previous books, but with everything else going on, I understood that it didn't exactly take precedence.  The ending was well done, with all of the loose ends neatly tied up.  I was disappointed to see it come to an end, simply because I didn't want to say goodbye.  Theres something bittersweet about reading the final book in a series and realizing that my time with these particular characters is coming to a close.

This novella is very short, coming in around 30 pages. The punch that James D. Horton packs into those pages is phenomenal, though! This story came to a close way too early for me. I enjoyed every element of it, and I can't wait to spend more time with Lily and Wolf.

  Lily is my kind of heroine. She radiated determination and grit. I wish more heroines were written like her! I really enjoyed Wolf, too. I chuckled at his ironic name. The relationship between the two really works out well. Intensity, of the good kind, is one of the adjectives I'd use for them!

  Like I said, this book is on the shorter side. But I am still amazed at how quickly I was drawn into it. You just simply cannot go wrong with reading about Lily and Wolf. I know the second book in the series is going on my TBR pile!

Catelyn Travis is one step closer to finding out who her parents' killer is once and for all. She has stepped up her game, this time attempting to coax the killer out with small amounts of misinformation. When it seems like she has reached a dead end, her best friend goes missing and the blame falls on her. Nothing is as it seems and you will find yourself questioning reality as the plot thickens.

There were some spelling errors and some grammatical errors, but the story progression was unhindered and still highly enjoyable.

This story and its prequel are meant to be enjoyed by adults only due to graphic sexual encounters. I'd like to give it a trigger warning as well due to animal abuse, sexual abuse, and some graphic depictions of violence.

Overall, I loved the story. The suspense is all-consuming from cover to cover and the ending is heart-stopping. I found myself immersed in the tale, feeling fearful for the characters and questioning my sanity from beginning to end. I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy.

For several books now we have been teased by Nera Darc, treasure hunter, daredevil and all round scary lady! There's one brother though who pushes all her buttons and that's the studious Niklas. He may no longer work at the Institute but he still loves all things rare and the most precious thing to cross his path has to be the beautiful and oh so dangerous Nera! It's just too bad that she constantly one ups him and steals the artefacts Nik and his brothers struggle so hard to find!
Nik has no intention of working for the corrupt Institute again but a fabulous opportunity to journey back to Earth alongside Nera is one he can't turn down. Earth is a barren land, a victim of the violent war that changed the landscape forever and yet the chance to bring back antiquities unites these treasure hunters. Only short visits on the surface are permitted due to the radiation levels but there's more than one kind of danger waiting out there. As Nik and Nera team up they soon discover that Earth is not as unihabited as they thought and their expeditition on the post apocalyptic planet is fraught with danger !
I loved this story. The author took me on a journey that was exciting, downright scary and full of adventure and passion. Nera slowly reveals her secrets to Nik and hers is a truly heart breaking story. Nik is at times quite sweet with his enthusiasm for the ancient world and it was easy to see how Nera fell more and more for his outright charm. Add in a landscape that's inhospitable and life forms that chilled this reader and you begin to see just why I had so much fun reading this book. If you haven't already started this series fear not as this book can easily be read a standalone but why not treat yourself and follow the journey that this couple have been on.

This book was utterly delightful, perhaps more for me, and avid fan of M/M than it might be for others, but truly, I haven't read anything this fun since Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the Dragonlance Chronicles. I had a very difficult time putting this book down, and never wanted it to end. Kehfrey is very much reminiscent of the Kender,Tasselhoff Burrfoot, just as carelessly skilled and  just as charming, but where Tas had the innocent nature of his race built-in, Kehfrey is growing up in a dark world that he comprehends quite well.

Decades after reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight I remember the names of all the primary characters, have solid images of them in my mind, so much that I recently tried to reread the Chronicles, only to discover a lack of writing skill that I had not been aware of when I was younger.

So let me say that I am more than thrilled to meet K.M. Frontain's characters, and I have a strong feeling that they will remain crystal clear in my memory for decades to come.

So, yes, this is a book about a garden. But thats not really the point  its the vehicle for the real story, which was the authors quest for meaning and answers in her life.

The story comes into light as the author and her husband buy a large piece of property and her father dies almost simultaneously. Its the passing away of one part of life and the beginning of another part of life. And although the author had a relationship with her father, he was a man of few words  at least with her.  With his death, her mother is left behind, though their relationship had often been acrimonious. Aging and frail, the authors mom favors the authors sister leaving the author with a lot of pain and many questions.

There are two narratives going on  one about family, one about growth and restoration. Although, the family story could also be about growth and restoration.

The author was attracted to the property from remembrances of a childhood filled with escape  sneaking off into the forest to find peace  only to be unnoticed at home. In a way, she was free but in another way, lost. As with many children who seek the love of a parent, they grow into adults still yearning for the same acceptance and love. In the authors case, her mother was a gardener and perhaps this is a last-ditch attempt to create a garden worthy of her mothers love, thus, making her worthy of that love as well.

That is not meant to be for a number of reasons. The garden restoration takes nearly a decade and in that time, the mothers declining health (stroke) and dementia, eventually force her to be relocated into a nursing home. As the sisters dig through their mothers belongings, they find some documents that are illuminating. And help to demystify her parents a little bit.

Despite the grievances, pain and loss represented in this story, the author comes to terms with some of the mysteries of her parents  though not all. In the end, she accepts them with all of their shortcomings and moves forward in her own life.

The book includes a number of recipes and crafting ideas that were nice additions to the volume.

I read the short story that this was born from in Bite Sized Offerings Anthology and already fell in love with some of the characters. Here we meet new ones with a more adult themed book. The character building was top notch and the same can be said for the storyline. Fast paced and action packed! There were no lulls at all, in fact I read it in two sittings giving up much needed sleep because I simply could not put it down. I laughed, choked back a few tears and even gnawed on some fingernails during the read! This author has such a way with words. Her explanations and descriptions are such that they play out like a movie in your mind's eye. She has some funny insults, quips and sayings that I filed away for future use. I cannot wait for book two. It can't release soon enough. It is rare that I buy the paperback of an eBook that I already own--maybe one in 40 books or more.

667710,4,False,"05 7, 2014",AFV75N2D1EMMM,B00K5XAZ5W,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Patricia L Korbet,"This review originally appeared on my blog, In Patti's Imagination. I received this book for an honest review. On the 5-star rating systems, it gets 4 stars from me. On my blog rating, which uses 10-star ratings, it gets 7.5 stars. I'm rounding up because I think that this was an excellent conclusion to Hunter and Leafy's story and I want to recognize that. But there were some issues that made this my least-favorite entry in the series.

First, my annoyance at some of Hunter's attitude in Fury carried over to Flame and multiplied. When he was 100% in protect-Autumn/rescue Jessie mode, he was under a lot of stress and I guess I forgave his behavior more. But here, the worst is over and his attitude is all because of his insecurities and his inability to deal well with his past. Okay. I get it. He's damaged. It was hard to feel sorry for him when he was a HUGE jerk to Autumn more than once. I won't spoil it by saying why, but there were several moments early in the story where I wanted to slap him. For her part, Autumn experiences even more growth than we saw from her in Fierce, so I can't complain about her story too much.

Second, there are a few things in this series that stretch believeability for me - things that are maybe not impossible but are highly improbable - but though they're not enough to make me dislike the story, they are also more obvious once we get to this segment. The narrative moves slower and is more character-driven, so perhaps that's why the improbability becomes more evident. When you're blazing through action, you notice less flaws - sort of like flying through on a bullet train compared to a slower locomotive. The faster you move, the less you can see of the weird stuff on the side of the tracks. Where Fierce and Fury were more like a bullet train, Flame was like long-distance commuter train. It still moved, but I could see more as I passed.

That said, there was one thing that absolutely redeemed the story for me by the end and bumped up its rating, and it was the fact that both characters grew. I don't mind the rougher characters, the ones who are not perfect book boyfriends, as long as they grow. Likewise, the stereotypical heroines have to stretch, too. Here, I loved that geeky Autumn embraced her sexuality and Hunter tempered his sexual beast and they were able to meet in the middle. That's a good metaphor for the emotional changes they undergo as individuals and as a couple. He gave her the love she needed and found that he was stronger than he believed, and she grew to love herself through his eyes. And as I always say, give me characters I can stand behind, and I can overlook a lot of other issues.

Clarissa has said that there may be other stories in the future for Jessie or maybe Jaret, but for now, this is the end of the Fierce Series, and I'd guess, given the ending, that it's probably the end of Hunter and Leafy's story told from their POVs. It was a nice conclusion to the series, and I'd recommend that you sit down and read them in sequence. You'll be rewarded with a lovely ending.",Great conclusion for Hunter and Leafy,1399420800,10,

Maybe it was because the protagonist kept repeating the same actions, but then again, that was a major point in the book. Carly can't get her life back on track after several deaths of people closest to her derail the train. She embraces alcohol, substance abuse, and bed-hopping in order to suppress pain and memories she can't deal with.

I'm not a ""Cali-Gal"" so was unable to determine if some of the actions of the characters were exaggerated or not, but they made for an amusing read at times.

Hhmm I don't like saying that I disliked a book and especially one that was gifted to me, but this one just didn't cut it for me. The story seemed very disjointed and I sometimes had trouble working out who was actually talking.

Jessica Lockhart is a 29 yr old virgin, worker at a insurance company and has some wicked erotic dreams about her ""dream lover"", she indulges in some serious alone time orgasms but has never had the real thing. She is waiting for Mr dream lover to come into her real life and take her V card.

Enter Ellis McKenna, filthy rich, drop dead gorgeous and now new owner of the company that Jess works at. He meets her on the side of a busy street on his wsy to meet and greet and offers her a lift and out of the pouring rain. ( this was the worst pick up line and situation I have ever heard).. Jess recognizes Ellis straight away and she cannot deny the chemistry that is there from thst 1st meeting, but when he singles her out while meeting the other associates, questions begin to be asked. Ellis makes it very well known that he wants Jess amd will pretty much do anything ot takes to have her.

Instead of the typical dominant, arrogant billionaire that is in most stories Ellis, has a much softer side, once he is aware that she is a virgin, he takes it slowly with her. But with a whole world of baggage after the death if his wife and children, he is not interested in long term so the offer of weeks of heat filled sexual encounters is put in the table Jess turns him away. She wants long term, her real dream lover....

Can she change Ellis' mind or will she be left heart broken.?

5 Stars for My Beloved Miko!

Funny
Entertaining
Heartbreaking
Insanely Romantic
and Bunny Ears!

THE CHARACTERS

Miko (The Mako Shark) - There just isn't anyone else like Miko. Thank goodness! But how can anyone not completely love this endearing assassin? Yes, I said-endearing assassin.

""He hates the violence.""
""But he loves you.""
""Yes,"" Miko said. ""It is my lot in life.""
Nasir shrugged. He couldn't disagree.

Toby - As boyfriend and lover, Toby seems to have the most painful role in this whole series. His denial is over. He's in full reality mode now.

---Toby's voice was already shaky and Miko knew that no matter how this night turned out, what he was doing to Toby now would be the most painful thing he'd ever done to anyone. ""I am sorry.""---

Nassir - Dark, silent, deadly and Miko's best friend. And he's always right. Always. And he has a tattoo gun.

THE STORY

Miko MUST avenge his friend's death which leads to many discoveries not the least of which is discovering that Frank has a boyfriend, Blondie. What a lovely, tangled conundrum Ms. Castle is taking us on. Miko begins to see possibilities, but he knows just how dangerous he is. And that danger puts those he loves in harm's way.

Nasir's expression was grim as he inspected the damage, and even though his expression was rarely anything but grim, Miko felt somehow responsible for the sadness that his friend may not even be experiencing. Miko, frequently felt responsible for things that weren't his fault, as if subconsciously trying to give himself some level of importance when he knew that he wasn't.

The tragedies that Miko encounters in this book are balanced by his relationship with Toby. But Miko struggles with an immensely guilty conscience that doesn't always guide him well. Fortunately he has Nas and Toby and even Joe Russell to advise him. Remember, Nassir is always right.

The bathtub on the cover of this book brings focus to the story and Miko's reasons for revenge. It also has a great backstory to it, ask the author about it when you get a chance. But, in the meantime, linger through an entirely different bathtub scene in this book that is gorgeous, tender, and strange. It is a classic example of Nicole Castle's craft.

THE WRITING

Wit. That's the crux of it all. Nicole Castle's wit and humor and twisted use of morality, or er, immorality, totally works for me. I've read these characters over and over and each time there is something I missed before. Something more to savor and to be shocked by and to get lost in. I wonder how strange it must be for an author to have fans tell her that they love her murderous, nefarious, entirely insane characters? Which is more twisted, the reader or the writer?

You'll need to pay attention to the chapter headers for clarity, but the timeline is clearly defined. This book is written in a manner that takes you through some earlier hits in Miko's life, something that the author also does on her blog. She writes mini-hits that are almost like shorts and give a delightful richness to the full world surrounding Silva's assassins. These ""greatest hits"" are your bonus material and not to be missed. Just like this entire series.

I would like to thank Nicole Castle for providing me with a review copy in exchange for my honest review.

I also enjoy reading the few first chapters about food and nutrition overall.
I've learned a few things and so far it's been really informational.

This book is great is you enjoy cooking with whole ingredients.

There were parts that kept me on the edge of my seat. Honestly, Im not into zombies; however, the story wasn't about zombies. Not really. Its more about survival than anything else.

When the FLASH happened, it killed most of the population. Some of the people who had survived became almost monstrous, zombie-like.

Creepy.

There were parts in this tale that had my heart racing, and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I felt bad for the main character Lillie because all of her life she had nobodyeven before the FLASH happened. She grew up in foster homes and left at an early age to be on her own. When all hell broke loose, Lillie had no one to turn to, so she survived on her own. She ended up pregnant after she was raped and became a mother. She named her daughter Azami who was the light in Lillies dark world. One day, they came across Jamesa boy who was also surviving on his own. I like James and Lillie. It was cool how they became their own little family. Then a year later they decided to head to a place James older brother used to talk about before the apocalypse happened. James had high hopes his brother would be there since he couldn't find him after the FLASH.

Im going to stop there because I don't want to give away any spoilers, but lets just say Lillie doesnt have good luck, and what she and James find when they reach their destination rocks her world.

This is a good story about survival, love, and trust. Im glad I read it, and Im looking forward to reading the next book in this series.",Good Story!,1460160000,,

The first book in that series was Vision of Love the first book of Infinity series by S. Moose and I hate when books end in a cliffhanger when you think they are standalone. It was hard to keep reading this book. I am not a fan of Nicholas. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why he needed to get remarried to his ex wife. 2/3 of the book you keep reading about Nicholas asking Karly who is his girlfriend, who he keeps promising her the future and that they will get married to never give up on them and that he can't explain why he broke up with her and that he still loves her. Ok, Jamie the ex wife of Nicholas comes back and all of a sudden in the book you have Nicholas breaking up with Karly and getting remarried to Jamie even though he doesn't love Jamie and he can't tell anyone even his family why he is doing this. 2/3 of the book later we find out Jamie has ""cancer"" and wants to redeem herself in everyone's eyes. There were so many ups and downs in this book that I am not really sure what I read.  I hated what Jamie was doing to everyone, hated the way Karly was treated by Nicholas, didn't like Nicholas and felt like he couldn't stand up to Jamie and all her lies. If the book would have ended by what happened in the last chapter before the epilogue I probably would have given this book 2 stars.  But since the book had a HEA that made it better.

***Part of the Fated Mates Anthology which I received from the publisher for an honest review, but I bought it because I liked it :)

The cover is great, and you definitely think shifter when you see it :)

This is the 2nd story in the Fated Mates Box Set that I just bought.  This story had me confused in the beginning, and while the confusion cleared up, I just didn't connect with any of the characters.  Im thinking it is because this is the first book in the series, but not sure it could be my head cold and headache.  Hannah is sort of naive as a character in my opinion because she never asks questions and knows nothing about her community that is full of shifters.  Caleb protects her, but you do not know much about him.

I think if you like shifter books that you will enjoy reading this story.  I am definitely going to continue reading more by this author.","Shifter story, but didn't connect",1394064000,,

Matthew, an apparent womanizer that treats them as eye candy just because he can and because they entertain him. After meeting Amy on her lowest moment their relationship develops very quickly. Which was strange to me considering her background.
Soon after she start working for him and during a conference he invites Amy to participate and take notes, he muted the call to simply tell Amy how gorgeous she was, gets back to the call, but signals her to unbotton her blouse so he can feast and fantasize whilst listening to his boring call.... So condescending and unreal.  Although she's aware of Matthew's womanizing background -  a player, not only does she open the buttons of her blouse per his request, but also opens her legs to him and allows him to fondle her to an O, while attending to the call and not even looking at her..... who does or allows that!?!
Okay, he's apparently incredibly hot, incredibly rich, incredibly successful, brooding, demanding and she has the hots for him, but damm girl, play a little hard to get!!!

By the end of book 1, her secret is out. Which made me feel more  puzzled for her easy behaviour and how quickly her relationship with Matthew developed without really knowing one another. I also found her language/phrases with someone she barely knew and thereafter a bit outlandish considering she had a traumatic experience, her language in the heat of the moment was borderline vulgar instead of seductive. To me, her character and her behaviour was sorta strange for being a victim of abuse.

Book two was much a continuation of book one, a lot of words, but no closer to them knowing more about each other and the what the rivalry between Craig and Matthew meant if anything, therefore dragging this read further until it's end with an interesting twist when Amy's abuser is hired to be the CFO at Craig's company. Which speaks to the lack of character development and Amy being too obtuse to follow instincts she had from the start.

In book 3 the story finally starts to fall into place, the plot got some fire under it and I found myself enjoying the read instead of skipping pages as I had. For much of it, Amy's relationship with Matthew still needed more development. But the connection between Amy, Matthew, Craig, her abuser, Rebecca and the rival engineering corporations finally started to connect making sense for an interesting ending at least.

The Cowboy wins a Bride is a May 2013 release, published by One Acre Press and Crush Star. This is book two in The Cowboys of Chance Creek series. Claire is coming home to Chance Creek, Montana for her brother Ethan's wedding. Jamie Lassiter plans on proposing to Claire sticking to his plan to date her a few times and to remind her that she belongs in Montana with him and the horses and the life she once loved. But when Claire arrives, she is in a ""mad the whole world"" mood. Her partner in her interior design business stole her money and is trying to steal the company too. She and Daniel were lovers as well as business partners. When Claire's parents were killed in an accident last year, certain moves were made with Jamie Lassiter that saved Claire from financial ruin. Now she has a sizable income and plans to take a trip around the world. When Jamie hears this plan, he panics and proposes to Claire without sticking to his plan. Claire thinks it's a joke. But, Jamie makes her a deal. If she will help design his new home and help out with his new guest ranch for six weeks, she can decide if it's ranch life and marriage to him or a career in interior design in the city. Claire accepts his challenge, but with one stipulation. No touching, and for Jamie - no flirting with other women. Claire is convinced that Jamie will not be able to uphold his end of the bargain. Being back in Montana has brought about many painful memories for Claire. She was still angry and bitter about the things her mother had done.  She was also angry at Jamie for breaking her heart, for being such a flirt with every woman he met and for making her think about having a life with him, when she knew he would not be faithful to her. She was also mad about Daniel has made revenge against him her one and only goal in life. She is approached by a client that has a major interior design project planned and Claire learns Daniel is her competition for the job. To put the cherry on the cake, Claire learns some shocking things about her mother that solidifies her anger and makes Claire a very angry, self absorbed, bitter woman. Claire becomes so enraged with life, she is just not a person anyone wants to spend a great deal of time with. She loses her perspective and focuses only on the negative side of things. Jamie has no idea why she is so unsure of his love for her. It seems no one can get through to Claire. Until Claire has a disturbing conversation with a ranch employee with a certain knack at reading people. Then Claire finds herself in some serious danger she begins to give some serious thought to her life and the direction she is heading in. Can she ever trust Jamie? Does she want to go back to being a big city interior designer or does she miss her life in Montana?  Claire has a lot of thinking to do. Will she make the right choice? Can Jamie convince her his marriage proposal was for real? I really liked this book. I think most of us have gone through a period in our lives when nothing seemed to go our way. One thing right after another goes wrong . It would be really easy to wind up feeling like Claire did. I felt sorry for her at times, but she really got carried away with her anger. It just got to be too over the top at times. Jamie was a dream. He didn't really realize how flirty he was with women and how that lead Claire to mistrust him. He really loved Claire and had the patience of Job. As events continued to crash down around Claire, Jamie was solid and steady. In the end, Claire is able to reconcile both sides of her personality. She actually gets to have her cake and eat it too. I recommend this book to any romance lovers. This is a contemporary western romance- but it also has element of romantic suspense. If you like hot cowboys, you can not pass this one up. This one gets a B+",Good Contemporary Western Romance /Romantic Suspense,1374796800,24,

I fell in love with Mackenzie's character, she was headstrong and fast acting by escaping human interaction. She wanted not harm to come to her friend. She left everything behind and embraced what became of her.  She was doing alright until she ""bumped"" into Margaret, Geoff and a young newly turned wolf.

Of what she was capable of....

She bit someone. She took someones life and changed it forever. but instead of running from her responsibility- she faced them.  She wanted to help Liam, but he didn't want help from her...so she did what was best for him and watched at a distance, but she was never far away if he ever need her.

No matter how many times Livy states she is nothing like her mother she finds herself in similar situations. Jealousy and revenge are evil bitches that make people do rash things.
Livy's stubbornness makes for an entertaining read. The way Livy is behaving is enjoyable to read. I find myself immersed in her emotions.
Questions get answered and truths are revealed. Secrets are disclosed and punishment is unleashed.
I appreciate all the drama and the back and forth of their relationship, but it's quite repetitive. Livy is mad at Miller and refuses to talk him and then she forgives him. It's confusing. I'm unclear as to the change of heart. She returns to the scene of the situation and seems to remedy the situation with Miller. Then in another instance Miller is pushing Livy away and it's unclear why.
Once again I find they only have a physical connection because sex is the only thing these two do without an argument.
Livy's sass and overthinking are too much at times. However, it makes for excellent read, but at the same time it puts a wedge in that connection that I do not have. Again sex is the only connection.

The Story:The book begins with the hero of the book, Spencer Allen, leading his team from TREX (Tactical Recovery EXperts, a shadowy organization that recovers things and people and is not beholden to or regulated by any government) trying to rescue a child, Tommy Miller, age 6, from three kidnappers, two men and woman. When Spencer and his team arrive where they think the child is being held, they find three dead bodies-ostensibly the kidnappers-but no Tommy.  What could have happened? Needing help, Spencer calls in his ex-lover Kathryn Louise Kat Davis, the heroine of the book and owner/co-founder of K-SAR, a private search-and-rescue company. Kat founded the company after she herself was lost and nearly not found.

Kat knows that Spencer works for TREX, but she is not privy to any information about his work, because they are essentially competitors. This caused a rift in their personal relationship. Back on the Miller case, things take a turn when they discover that Tommy may be wounded, and his grandfather, Martin-who is on the TREX Board of Directors-Tommys mother, Martha, and her boyfriend, Damon Salazar, show up unexpectedly.
Damon, it turns out, is involved with Tommys kidnapping; the level of Damons involvement is still to be determined. Meanwhile, Spencers relationship with Kat-they nearly have sex while on the search-is causing more problems for him with TREX; his supervisor, Dan Weber,  threatens to fire Spencer if he cant keep his relationship with Kat from interfering with his job.

Things take yet another turn when Weber informs Spencer that someone is threatening Kat. Spencer is told not to tell her about the threats, which wouldnt be the first thing hes kept from her. Tragedy strikes TREX when, while on a stakeout, one member of Spencers team is killed and another gravely wounded, making Spencer, not for the first time, question whether he wants to put Kat through what he went through. The subject of that stakeout, Salazar, then calls Kat claiming that a friend of his is missing; when TREX finds the man, Sam Green, he tells them about a shadowy group with big plans to take over the world. During this interrogation, Kat overhears a secret that Spencer kept from her; it results in her breaking up with him. Later, Green ends up dead, killed by the same organization he belonged to.

After further threats on Kats life-her SUV is blown up, among other things-Spencer takes Kat into hiding. However, this doesnt keep Kat safe as she is kidnapped by the mastermind of the Order, the shadowy group and one of its members, Damon Salazar, who is in cahoots with the mastermind, whose identity is fairly obvious to anyone who pays attention. The mastermind straps a bomb to Kat and leaves her out in the wild. Spencer rescues Kat, then a violent confrontation happens. The mastermind is killed and Spencer is shot and seriously wounded, but survives, and he and Kat have their Happily Ever After.

Theres a great deal to love about this book. It is definitely romantic suspense, with a lot of suspense. Kat and Spencer are both strong characters. If there is one flaw in the book, it is that the mastermind is too easy to spot; I figured out their identity mid-book. There are also spelling typos that probably should have been corrected in the ebook version I own.

Sex: Several pretty hot love scenes, although still not as hot as I would like.

Violence: A lot of it. Multiple shootings, killings. Only toward the end is the violence fairly graphic. Be also advised that there is a great deal of coarse language and sexual profanity.

I loved Out of the Shadows by author Bethany Shaw even with the ending.  Although it does have a cliff hanger with the story, come on it is a series; I thought it allowed me time to enjoy the story of Devon and Lark, the 2 main characters of the first in the series.  I loved how the author did not just go for intense sexual chemistry but a true connection.  Author Bethany Shaw had me hooked from the very beginning.
I do not want to give too much away, however I will tell you what I got from the book.  There is a thread that carries throughout the book about good versus evil and how the underdog can win against a bigger threat.  The romance is wonderful for the reader and the sexual connections are really hot, however it is just one of the threads that help to make the book so wonderful.  I did not want the book to end and was very glad that I had the second in the series to read.  Do not let someone else tell you that because of a cliff hanger it is not good, because honestly I loved the book even though I hate any cliff hangers.  Sometimes it is necessary to have it end that so that the intensity of the next in the series can make the reader want more.

Big rock is told from a male's POV (Spencer Holiday). Spencer was hilarious and completely out of control with his thoughts! Spencer and his best friend, Charlotte, fake an engagement to help his father sell the family jewelry business. This fake engagement was supposed to last only one week. As you guessed it, that one week changes everything for Spencer & Charlotte.

I am loving the videos that Lauren is leaving on Facebook right now! They are witty and hilarious. She takes that same wit and humor along with the classic Lauren Blakely writing style and wraps it all up in a pretty bow for us in Big Rock.

The Crown of the Queen by Jeffe Kennedy... 3.5 stars
and
The Undying King by Grace Draven... 5+ stars

I have to say if I'd read Jeffe Kennedy's The Twelve Kingdoms series, I probably would've adored The Crown of the Queen. But... I haven't read anything by this author so I was completely lost. There was just too much everything happening regarding crowning a new queen and all the information regarding a huge cast of characters I'd never met before. It's told through the eyes of Dafne, the librarian, and even though the writing is good, I felt like I was just slogging through it, waiting for the romance to start. This was supposed to be a 'romance', but aside from a man flirting with her as they danced and giving her a good-bye kiss in the beginning, that was all the romance there was. I kept reading and reading and wondering why Dafne's HEA hadn't been introduced. Then I started wondering if maybe Dafne was telling the story of the queen's romance with her consort, but that wasn't really it either. In the end, this novella seems like a backstory bridge to another book, which it probably is. As I said before, I might've loved this if I'd read the series.

On to the reason I bought this book... The Undying King.
After falling madly in love with Radiance and every other book Grace Draven has written, she is now one of my auto-buy authors. This story is full of love, loss and redemption and my heart broke for both Cededa and Imogen.

Cededa the Fair, or Cededa the Butcher... The Undying King... are perfect names for a king who is unbelievable gorgeous and also who would do anything, ANYTHING, to save his kingdom. He had fallen into myth.. a kingdom lost to time. Imogen is cursed with the touch of death--anyone who touches her skin dies--so she's never known the touch of a lover and never expected to. She's given a key to find his kingdom and told only The Undying King can remove her curse.

There are other plots within plots going on as well, because Imogen is not just some lowly witches' apprentice/daughter and Cededa's kingdom is rumored to hold treasures untold. Retrieving Imogen from Cededa's kingdom becomes another man's quest.

The romance between Imogen and Cededa builds slowly and sweetly and I loved every minute of it. This story is written with such rich imagery, I felt I could see Cededa's kingdom on every page.

I would've purchased this book for The Undying King alone, but I'm glad to have been introduced to Jeffe Kennedy's The Twelve Kingdoms series through The Crown of the Queen.","Two novellas...One beautiful romance, one backstory/bridge to The Twelve Kingdom series",1465862400,,

When Lianne said she was going to write a book about  Braiden I did have some misgivings. Braiden was a nasty piece of work and had been responsible for horrible stuff but I was intrigued  to see where this book would go. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book I devoured the pages within a day !
The story starts as Braiden is released from prison after severing 4 long years, he emerges as a different man from the man that went inside, he's had time to think and reflect on his actions and of those around him. He is ashamed of the man he once was, he wants nothing more than to start a fresh somewhere new where no one knows the new Braiden Donohue but that wish is short lived as he is sucked back into the world he is so desperate to escape only this time he has no idea who to trust and who is playing who. Until he meets her, his game changer the one girl he shouldn't be with and has no future with is the one girl who makes him see he is worth more.
I really didn't think I was going to like Braiden, but his time in prison has made him reflect on his actions and see what type of man he was and what type of man he wanted to be. I loved Cara she was sassy, feisty and never gave up on what she wanted ~ you can't help who you fall in love with, but she fought for love when Braiden couldn't.

We have seen the Carolina Couger's star kicker, Jaxon Reed, as the villian in the previous books. And there is nothing as delightful as seeing a bad boy reform. I guess he just needed to find that special someone, for him to have a change of heart.

Jaxon Reed seems to draw trouble wherever he goes. With his womanizing, fighting and the pranks that he has pulled on his teammates, he is far from being a ""hero"". And when a new star quarterback is recruited to the Carolina Cougers, he is itching to bring his ego down a few notches. Ryan Delaney is going to regret ever crossing paths with Jaxon.  And when Jaxon finds out that the woman he met at the bar is none other than Ryan's little sister, he sees the perfect plan to get Ryan and get some in the process.

Bristol Thomas is ecstatic to have her older half- brother come to Charlotte. Even though she loves her brother to death, she hates football players. She once dated a cheating football player and it left a bad taste in her mouth. She has no idea who the hot guy she met in the bar is. And when he makes an appointment with her to hire her as his interior decorator, she is thrilled at the chance to spend more time with him.

But when a former one-night-stand of Jaxon's can't seem to accept that there is no future for them and decides to stalk him and threaten Bristol in the process, things get a little dangerous for them.

I really enjoyed the premise of the story. I do so enjoy a villian who turns into a hero. But I have to say that I found the love scenes to not be as hot as the ones in the previous books of the series. I was really hoping for more heat from a bad boy like Jaxon ;) This really is a great series with great characters. Hope that there will be many more books to come!

In The Devil You Know, she exposes the softer and caring side of this unlikely matchmaker and provides a lot of insight into what makes the Viscount tick. Also revealed is the much hinted about relationship between Lady Diana and DeVere.

Ludovic DeVere is a charming and passionate lover. He is also a loyal and caring friend and brother. He can have any woman he wants, and his sights are now set on the lovely, but married Lady Diana. But Lady Diana stubbornly resists his advances and his attempts to tempt her into his bed.

Lady Diana's marriage may not be a love match, but she is a faithful wife who has no intentions of breaking her wedding vows. Until she learns a horrible truth about her husband. Then she makes a deal with the Devil to secure her future.

But as we all know, there is no happy ending for this erstwhile couple. Murder, deceit and blackmail effectively end their relationship before it has really begun. However, their paths continue to cross and underneath the tension between them is a sizzling passion that continues to burn.

How will their seemingly ill-fated story end? The answer to that question will be answered in The Devil's Match, Victoria Vane's next installment in her wildly exciting Devil DeVere series.

I had trouble with the rating on this one. The story and the writing is very well done. I don't remember finding any editing errors or typo's of any kind. It flowed quickly and definitely deserves at least 4 stars.

This was not your typical misunderstood, good guy vampire story. Masterson is a vampire from our nightmares. He has no regard whatsoever for humans. He is looking for his idea of a perfect donor. If he drains a few dozen or more humans in the process, he flat out does not care! When he runs into his 'Plum' it is the smell of death that surrounds her that attracts and beguiles him.

'Plum' is a bit of a mystery. You don't know if she is human or something 'other'. You are kept speculating until the 9th chapter. Then you get you 'Ah ha' moment.

A great Halloween story. Macabre and erotic. Very different and most definitely intriguing.

It is hard not to fall in love with Mason and Jillian.  Even though Mason seems like a real SOB, he turns it around throughout the course of the story.

This book starts out with the Advent wreath on the table. It's just like how my brothers and sister were raised. I can see us sitting around the table, candle lit week after week adding more while mom explained what it all meant to us.
Although she was not Catholic she raised all 5 of us to be Catholic, taking us not only to church but enrolling us into catholic school for 8+ years, going through Holy Communion, confirmation, etc. She'd use pine cones and holly branches and berries from our own trees to adorn the candles and Advent wreath.
I can relate to many of the authors challenges as I've faced them from one time to another.

He was really excited to read this e-book to learn more while playing in survival mode with his best friend.

PROS:
- Packed with information. There are tons of tips, and each tip has a nice amount of detail (it's not just one line tips that leave you scratching your head on how to proceed). The author actually elaborated how to accomplish certain aspects in the game. I was impressed with the amount of information that you get in the e-book. It's a refreshing change from so many 'tips and tricks' guides that end after a handful of pages (or ones that are longer, but filled with useless information and general, unrelated 'chit-chat')

- It's not just fluff, it's helpful information you can actually put to use in the game. My son was really excited to play and test out some of the new things he had learned. (we're still working on the 'infinite water in a pond' tip, but I'm sure he will get it with a bit of troubleshooting. He's already accomplished quite a few others already)

- Live longer and be more resourceful in survival mode. You won't only learn how to use resources in the world when building or crafting, but you'll learn little tricks to help stay alive much better.

CONS:

- Though the tips were well written and offer elaboration, it would have been awesome to see imagery to accompany some. A few of the tips were harder to follow for my son, and I think having an image, showing how to accomplish the trick would be really helpful.

- Verbiage is a bit advanced in some areas for younger readers. My compliments to the writer, he has a robust vocabulary, but some of it was above the reading level for my son, so we had to keep on the Kindle feature that tells you what more complex words mean. It seemed the book might be targeting 'big kids' to adults (though none the less, my son still really enjoyed it).

Overall, this is a good book for Minecraft players who want to become skilled in PvP and survival mode.

I've read and loved all books written by Jerrie Alexander. She's one of my go-to authors when I need a romantic suspense fix. This first book in her new series just didn't grab me as much as any of her other works. While the main characters didn't keep me captivated, I was definitely interested in the side characters, Colton and Luke.

I love that the author often starts of her stories with a glimpse into the villain's mind and his or her grizzly deeds. It accomplishes two things: it sucks me in and sets the tone for the suspense portion. I enjoyed the plot of having the hero return to his hometown only to get embroiled in the heroine's troubles and become both her ally and her lover. Erin's childhood made me feel sympathetic towards her, and she had some moments where she imparted some good advice to Rafe showing she had compassion, but that's where my interest in her as a character ended. Rafe was a little more fleshed out to make him interesting. I liked his very male, protective side, and I understood why he had no interest in a relationship.

Between the two of them, I just didn't feel the chemistry. Back in high-school, they weren't exactly friends. His father and her adoptive father had been best friends, she was the messed up girl, and he was the football hero. In an effort to be nice, he'd asked her to prom. That blew up in their faces over a silly misunderstanding. They hadn't seen or spoken to one another in twelve years when they met again, and right away they were having x-rated fantasies about one another. Considering she'd held on to the past hurt for twelve years, their insta-lust was a little too sudden. I felt I was being told about their feelings rather than being shown.

The suspense portions were the best parts of this book. The villain's POV kept things interesting since I kept trying to read between the lines for clues. Erin managed to help herself without needing her knight in shining armor, which I appreciated. Even though this book didn't quite do it for me, the brief glimpses of Luke (Rafe's younger, Army Ranger brother) and Colton (Rafe's partner) were enough to capture my interest, and I'd love to read more about them.

I was left hanging on the edge of my seat by the last book, and cannot wait for another one. I really do enjoy Christina Ross's writing. Love love love all her books.
That being said I wish that the reasons Lisa had been kidnapped were talked about a little more it was a bit vague considering all the build up of Boss and Kevin. It all seemed to wrap up without a whole lot of explanation other than her writing is an abomination, The steaminess was missing a bit in this one but the action and suspense made up for it. I could not put it down. Finished reading it in a day and a half. Really good read!

Logan and John are easy to love characters. They both have things that happened in their individual pasts that changed their lives. Family tragedy changed the course of John's life at the age of 18; war altered Logan permanently a little later in life. They both recognize the strength in the other, overlooking what others might see as limitations. It's endearing when John lovingly caresses Logan's mangled legs, and heartening when Logan easily accepts John's eagle side with a smidgen of hero worship.

This is a fast paced story that cuts to chase quickly when it comes to the men's attraction to one another as well as the reveal of John's shifter side. To her credit, Mia West has a way of packing a lot of information into a short tale, without making her reader feel overwhelmed.

I always enjoy Ms. West's writing. Her books are easy to fall in to, her characters easy to adore. If I could change anything, it would be to add more back story to Logan's war injuries, maybe something about his decision to accept himself as a gay man. John had an air of mystery that comes with most shifters, but some development of his story could lend to the angst. But, this is my selfish fan-girl plea of Ms. West with most of her stories...

BUT that isn't the part that annoyed the crap out of me. It's the fact that even after all the crap he put her through.. two years and no contact later.... he shows up out of the blue all ""I love you blah blah"" and she FALLS FOR IT!

I literally almost added this to my DNF list because I can't take the dumbness. and his reason for doing everything that he was going.. was completely dumb... You are a freaking billionaire even if the terms are alittle off.. your wife is a amazing per the book and yet you are out having affairs like a lame.

So this book pissed me off and annoyed the hell out of me.. the level of dumb made me even more frustrated, I am more pissed at myself for not stopping when I knew that I should have just added it to the DNF list.

A Matchless Romance is the story of Tabitha Bell and Drew Watson. Tabitha is a matchmaker whos unlucky in love. Due to her upbringing, she knows men and shes very good at matching people together. Unfortunately for Tabitha, her upbringing also tends to make men have a misconceived perception of her. Drew is a video game designer. Hes very good at what he does. Drew is attractive but doesn't see it. He tends to say the first thing that comes to mind, and that can be a little awkward in social situations. Especially around women. Drew tends to be analytical and takes comments literally. He is one of those rare heroes who is both an Alpha and a Beta.

Tabitha and Drew initially meet when Drew runs into her and unintentionally cops a feel. With the future of his new video game on the line, Drew convinces Tabitha to use her matchmaking skills to coach him on how to be around women in order to please his female boss.

The attraction between these two is there from the start. Drew doesnt think someone as beautiful as Tabitha could ever be interested in a gaming-geek like him. Drew is the kind of guy Tabitha really would love to be with. She doesnt want to risk her job and become her mother. When these two finally get together, its more than they dreamed.

Simply put, A Matchless Romance is truly a feel good read that will have you smiling and laughing out loud from the very beginning. Christi has written a wonderful story to end her Aisle Bound Series.

SYNOPSIS: No woman walks away from Zane Westmoreland. But when Channing Hastings does just that, it leaves the rancher reeling--and then she returns to town, engaged! Zane will do whatever it takes to show her that there is no man for her but him

Review: Like all Westmoreland men they are proud, stubborn and sometime arrogant, and Zane is no different.  Zane was the one that some of the younger Westmoreland would come to when they had questions or need advice about woman. So imagine his surprise when he finally realizes that he was in love with Channing and he let her get away.
Channing is a softhearted and passionate woman who brightened up any room; she was in a class all by herself and in love with Zane.

Two year later Channing is back and engaged to be married. As with any relationship Zane has always been up front with any woman he was involved with and Channing hadn't been an exception, he set the same ground rule with her but she slip past him. The one thing Channing wanted scared Zane. As time goes on Zane realize that he has always being in love with Channing and had been fighting ever since she left.

In the end, both Zane and Channing will get what they truly want, which is each other. Zane has proven to Channing that he loves her unconditional.

Mrs. Jackson to us from Denver to Virginia Beach and I have to say that setting for this story was on point.  As always Brenda Jackson has pen another great story and I can't wait for Canyon and Stern story.

Some books take you (me) a few chapters to get into, this book had me hooked after a couple of chapters. I loved the language/dialect. The dialect along with the descriptions of the surroundings and town helped me visualize Lil Bits town and give a glimpse of what life was like in Arcadia, Florida. I enjoyed the writing, the storyline and the characters. Although the story is told from the point of view of Lil Bit (Lily) the story is about many characters and their relationships with each other. This book is about family, family secrets, small town secrets, racial tension, acceptance and love. This book is also a mystery withing a mystery? Who killed Rags? Who is Lil Bit's father? What happened to Tommy? What is going on with Lil Bit's Mother?

I also thought the Author did a great job writing from a young girls point of view. Lil Bit is between the ages of 10-13 in this book. I thought the Author did a great job of having her insights and thoughts match that age range.

""If you have ever considered trying m/m romance a try, this is the book to start with."" ~Under the Covers

Wow!!!  Just wow!!  Words cannot even describe how much I loved this book, but nonetheless, I will try.

OUR DECEMBER begins with a glimpse of an already established couple, Jared and Alex, who, even at such a quick glimpse, the reader can tell are so very much in love.  It is Christmastime, and before long, we are taken back 14 years to see how these two amazing men got their start.

Jared is a 20-year old man, thrown into adulthood faster than most.  His dad has died, leaving Jared to take over his construction company.  He is trying to take the reigns in a seamless manner, is working hard to keep the company alive, and is also trying to provide for his mother in the way that his father previously did.  Working on a job at the local college has attracted the eye of Alex, who boldly approaches him and asks Jared if he is gay.  His courage at doing so begins what will quickly become a very sweet friendship and a beautiful relationship.

There's just one small problem - Alex is 15.  Even so, Jared cannot help but be mesmerized by Alex's gorgeous smile...it lights up his world and takes his breath away every time he sees it.  But above all else, Jared is a man of integrity.  So while he and Alex forge their friendship, there is a strong mutual attraction on both of their parts, but Jared keeps things strictly platonic and establishes rules for them and their burgeoning relationship: while Alex is 15, there is to be no touching.  And even with such a strict rule, it's amazing how Adams weaves such a beautifully romantic tale.

There are so many things that I just absolutely loved about this book.  First and foremost, I loved seeing how Jared and Alex got their start.  I love watching a couple get to know one another and establishing a foundation on which to build, and these two boys do just that.  They spend a great deal of time together, and yes, they are both attracted to the other, but there is so much more to it than that.  Jared not only becomes a friend to Alex, but a mentor as well.  Which leads me to the next thing I loved about this book - the characters.

Alex, only 15, has his whole life ahead of him.  He's in high school, is so young, so innocent, and yet so sure of what he wants in life.  He has big dreams and aspirations, and after developing his friendship with and growing attraction to Jared, he knows that in ten years he will have graduated from MIT, work with the best contractor in town (e.g., Jared), and wake up next to Jared every morning.  Jared, who is so mature in so many ways for being 20, is similarly attracted and drawn to Alex, but he believes that Alex's feelings will change with time, and is willing to let him go when he needs or wants to.  In the meantime, though, he is there for Alex as a support system as he tries to fully understand his sexuality, his feelings, and growing up in general.  And because Jared is so full of integrity and character, he holds true to the limits he's imposed on his relationship with Alex even when he wants more.

In time, Alex is sent away to prep school, and the separation is difficult for both of them.  Fortunately, Alex's best friend, Clark, has become close friends with Jared, so at least Clark and Jared have each other to keep them occupied during Alex's absence.  This leads me to another favorite aspect of this book - the supporting characters.  Clark is Alex's very straight BFF.  He doesn't fully understand ""the gay thing,"" as he so eloquently puts it, but he is there for Alex whenever he's needed, no matter what.  Added to the depth of friendship that he provides for Alex, and eventually Jared as well, Clark's sense of humor and his endless appetite for greasy food are so enjoyable to read.  We also get a glimpse of the type of character that Alex's father is as well, and the love he has for his son is so evident and seemingly unconditional, which is always so refreshing to read.

Lastly, I just love the chemistry and tension that builds so beautifully between Jared and Alex.  Due to their age and the limits imposed upon them, there really aren't any sex scenes for them, but the simple beauty of their love and respect for each other more than makes up for it.

I seriously cannot recommend this book enough. If you have ever considered giving m/m romance a try, this is the book to start with.  Adams has written such a wonderful story of growth, love, and romance, and developed each part of it magnificently.  Jared and Alex's tale is so heartwarming, and their love just pours off the page.  Adams finishes OUR DECEMBER by closing the circle of the story that she began - by bringing it back to them 14 years later, highlighting the importance of their time at Christmas...and what a poignant and beautiful time it is.

I felt absolutely nothing in this book, which surprised me, because like I said, this isn't my first book by this author. But here, there was not  lot in the way of world building, IMO, and more time spent on physical descriptions than on actual character development. Knowing what they look like is a plus, but knowing who these characters are and what made them that way is more important. Paris had convinced himself that he was meant to be a solitary creature, like his mother, because he was a panther. But even he was wrong on that, not to mention that he was only half-panther. Even the characters don't know why they are the way they are! And this was my 1st time reading a M/M shifter book where the entire pack says that there's no such thing as a gay werewolf. What? That was about the dumbest plot point to even have in the book. That would be the equivalent of someone saying there's no such thing as a gay man. And the fact that it was so widely accepted proved why they thought it was a good idea to have a forced marriage no matter who it involved: they were all ignoramuses. And that irked me.

Cole was right, he would have been better off leaving. Him one day taking on the role of alpha is a laughable idea. He was weak and annoyingly passive-aggressive. He often second guessed himself. And even during times where he needed to act as leader, he couldn't even look people in the eye or speak without stammering and blushing. His best friend, Lindsey, was more alpha material than Cole was. Paris just seemed like a finicky, selfish pain in the butt. And like another reviewer said, I felt NO CHEMISTRY WHATSOEVER between the 2 of them, to the point where if they'd ended up not getting together in the end, the only thing I would've been upset about was spending my 99 cents. The only thing they had in common was sex, and the sex wasn't that hot, and that scene of their 1st time in a tree didn't even seem realistic. And why the h**l did Paris keep calling Cole ""Puppy""? He didn't even give him the respect of calling him Cole, not even during sex. And if you've read a lot of other shifter books, even when the 2 MCs are different animals, then you'll be a bit aggravated with the fact that Cole & Paris didn't even know if they were mates or not. Cole said he believed Paris was his mate, he wasn't sure. And Paris eventually decided to accept Cole as his mate in the 2nd to last chapter. I'm not saying that I won't read anything else by Tara Lain, but it probably won't be anything else in this series.",I felt nothing!,1425772800,2,

Welcome Home For Christmas is a beautiful and funny Christmas romance that will get you in the right mood for the holidays, and will make you swoon and wish you were in Allisons shoes.

Although the trope might seem like something thats already been seen and read (single girl in need of a fake boyfriend decides to hire handsome guy whod go to her family meeting with her), I liked how Annie Rains gave a fresh twist to it, creating a beautiful story that will keep you turning pages to find out what happens next.

Allison is a very nice and relatable character, a heroine you cant help rooting for from the very beginning. Shes torn between wanting to be independent and needing to feel loved by a man who won't disappoint her. To make things worse, her mother is a renowned psychologist who never approved of any of the boyfriends Allison has brought home in the pastand she was always right about them.

Troy. Do I really have to comment on him? I mean, cant you just trust me when I say hes the most adorable, swoon-worthy Grinch that ever existed? Every hero in this series has something that will steal your heart from the very first moment he steps into the scene, and Troy isn't any different. Hes as funny as hes hota deadly combination.

Welcome Home For Christmas is a truly beautiful story, with just a bit of steam and a whole lot of heart-warming and entertaining moments, that will keep you smiling and swooning for a few hours. I highly recommend picking up this book, shutting out the rest of the world and losing yourself in Allison and Troys story for a few hours.

Sadly, weve come to the final book in this beautiful series, and I cant deny Ill miss the people of Seaside. Thank you, Annie Rains, for creating these beautiful stories that kept me smiling, crying, swooning and falling in love with a new book boyfriend every single time.

There were so many snarky moments, this book had me gasping aloud and laughing the next! Ill admit she did have me crying around 80% and kinda through the ending! I LOVED this book!

I must say I always love a HEA after the mind blowing story. The HERS series is one of my favorites, it's ABOUT THAT LIFE. Whether it was the HOT sex scenes Dawn brought to life in this series; (Finding Willow, the Motorcyle scene...need I say more).It was the filthy sarcastic mouth of Seven James <<<< I Love her! Don't forget the sexiness that all of her characters brought in this series. What got me hooked was and is the realness of the all the worlds portrayed in this series.

FACT meets FICTION is a hell of a way to tell a story. I know people that read this might say, well yeah. Noooo, this is how it is in those worlds. The Professional Kink Mistress = The badass powerhouse woman that takes no ISH from no one. Even if her world collides at the fate of someone else unfortunate history. A SUIT MOGUL = A sexy no nonsense male sub that only likes his women Seven James... Even if her lifestyle demands power over all things and can use a strap-on like she was born that way. But he loves it and her, that he saw it coming spiraling down to a horrible end.

Although the HERS series revolved around Seven James and Levi Parker. It also revealed a the life of a Porn-Star  Sex, Drugs, and Crime. All of which, is so true to life. LOVE IT! What got me so excited was  how the MC world was portrayed. I've read many books about MC's, enjoyed also. Not like this, the house gatherings, the off road traveling.... Dawn you've got some splaining to do. No, not really. I'm a dry comic... (Lol).

Anyhow, this was a perfect way to end this series. I absolutely loved it. I think all of Dawn's fans would too. Even if you are new to her work. Let me tell you, she's not sugar coated writer. That's the way an author should be. If you haven't read the HERS series, what the hell are you waiting on? Be ABOUT THAT LIFE and read this series. The End is fan-friggin-tastic! It took me there with my mouth open, yelling out on FB and all. I got over it, accepted that all great things at some point must to an end. I can tell you all the fine points of the book, give you a few spoilers but people have already did that. Yeah, I'm not that person.

He is still suffering from his most recent defeat, and the re-emergence of his first love, and his trainer's daughter, back into his life. It's story of hope, determination and the will to win.

Our main characters are Jack and Daniella. Jack being our boxer and Daniella being the daughter of his trainer and is his long-lost love from his youth. Daniella is back from California as she's inherited her father's gym  Stamina, and is determined to make it a success once again. Unfortunately, her father has left it in a precarious position and it's up to her and Jack to bring it back from the brink of obscurity.

Jack is feeling very sorry for himself since his defeat, and is wasting himself away by having a different woman in his bed each night and drowning his sorrow's in booze. His life looks like it will continue on this way until Daniella walks in and gets his life back on track despite their past relationship and the hurt that still surrounds them. It took me a while to warm to Jack, but he does make amends for his silly behaviour.

Daniella is a strong determined woman, and will do whatever it takes to help Jack and the gym succeed. She's also determined that the boxing world is not just a man's world, and that she (being a woman) can dominate from a managers/trainers seat also. I liked her positive outlook on things even though it didn't look too promising for a successful outcome at times.

The boxing journey feels realistic and there was a nice bit of drama thrown in to spice things up. Plus we also get to know a little about the other boxers that train at the gym and what they may have to offer in future books in this series.

The romance was nice mostly, but I felt there was a bit of overkill on the sex scenes. There were an instance or two where less detail may have been more in regards to their encounter, and it may have lifted the swoon level.

Out of work, Melanie asks Rafael, whom she has known for years and who manages a winery in town, for a job. Once in the job, Melanie hopes to move up in the winery and is willing to start in the tasting room. Both Melanie and Rafael have a history.  He has always been an outsider in town.  His father was also badly regarded by most, so he felt he also was badly regarded. He has harbored a crush on her for years and hopes that, once she gets over Greg, he can move into her life. Rafael also would like to buy the winery but does not have the money to purchase it. Melanie has been trying, since he left, to get over Greg and to understand his actions.

I'm just going to jump into my review here and start with the big problems. I did not like the character at all. Iyemo is spoiled, entitled, and whiny. Instead of trying to make the best of her situation, she blows off her new job, parties and then complains when she gets in trouble. The ""why me"" song and dance gets old, especially after doing stupid stuff, like posing naked for one of her boyfriends, (yes, I said boyfriends) a man she hardly knows, and then whines when she breaks it off and he sells said pictures to the tabloids. She also has a drug problem, which the author does portray well, but by the time she tries to get her life together, I'm so fed up with her that I don't care if she succeeds or not. The one good thing she does, helping Gomi, hardly redeems her in my eyes, and she definitely does not deserve his friendship or support. I did like Gomi as a character, as well as Leuwa, but they just weren't enough to help me through this book.

I also found the writing style to be distracting. In the very beginning of the book, the author jumps from present to past multiple times with no transitory warning, and it throws the reader out of the story. The narrator of the book is also extremely active, and addresses the reader often. I never really got used to it, and didn't find the way it was done appealing. Had the author explained what he was doing through the narrator in the beginning, it would have made the transition much easier from story to narrator.

Also as a side note, the plot of this book is basically a really, really long coming of age story set in space. There's a war threatening, but it ends up being nothing more than a plot device that's solved in a few sentences, and not by Iyemo. If that's not your cup of tea, I don't recommend this book for you.",Unlikeable FMC and an unusual writing style I couldn't get into,1449532800,,

He offers her a job with him and Julian, a doctor she's always wanted to work with and has always had the hots for. She knows it'll be tough working with both Julian and Colin but she decides to take the job. What she doesn't realize is that part of the job involves being a submissive to Julian and Colin.

Julian and Colin have been involved for years and have both wanted Rachel for years. When they bring her on the team they see this as an opportunity to finally bring her in to their relationship. As the work progresses so does the relationship between the 3 and Rachel finds herself falling for both men (she still had some leftover feelings from before and they just get build on as things progress).

Unfortunately there are some issues that come up in the professional side of their lives that causes Rachel to feel she's been screwed over and she leaves Colin and Julian. Eventually they do end up coming back together and forgiveness is given.

A lot happens between our couple in this one, what with wars and baby-making, neither of which really going according to plan, the cast of secondary characters extends with the addition of slave turned serf/handmaid Janet, a woman Brandford rescues, in an effort to show Alexandra just how much her being in his life is having on his respect for his subjects, and subsequent treatment of them. Her different perspective and fresh insight makes him want to do and be better, and because of it becoming a man that will one day be a worthy King.

It doesn't follow the typical story arc of one main couple - there are two couples, plus the doctor, plus a couple extras. We have Tim and Nathan, Enrique and Gary as our couples. I liked all four of them. There's Dr. Dexter who makes the story possible. And then there's Cara, Tim's BF and oddly we get to know a great deal about Sam, Cara's brother, who has no role in the story. I kept expecting Sam to make an appearance in the story, but he never does, so I'm not sure why I needed to learn all about his life. Also, I'm not entirely able to believe that the evil doctor could so quickly and thoroughly switch to being a good guy. It works for the story, but it's hard to believe it would really be that easy. I would have liked to see more of an internal struggle within the doctor, to show his capacity for good, instead of one day he is evil and the next day he decides to be good.
Aside from that, I thought it was a great story and the plot was well thought out. I did have a question about the antiserum though....if it reversed all the effects of the treatment, then how was Tim able to stay pregnant?

I loved this just as much as the first and can't wait to read the next one. (Reminiscing About Retail: Confessions Of A Cashier). This book starts where Cherished Cats and Childhood Capers left off and Becky is eighteen, married and already a mother. Her husband, Randy, is in the Air force. The family has to move around due to his work and Becky is often on her own as her parents and sister live many miles away. Like the previous one, there are plenty of pictures throughout the book, helping to tell the story. I really like this method, rather than having a 'photo section' say at the back of a book where you have to keep interrupting your reading to flick back and forth. This is quite a short book but Becky can say so much in so few words, it's short and straight to the point just like book one. The author tells of the old days, struggles with money and making the best of things with their home and shopping for essentials. When they were first married, Becky and Randy didn't have a washer so she had to go to the Laundromat, yet people seemed happier in those times and 'pulled together' more. Becky and Randy come across as grateful for what they have and seem content. This book was a lovely trip down memory lane for me. Reminding me of the times when people were 'one car families'-not husband and wife with a car each as is the norm for most families now. Like my mum, Becky used to walk to the shops, baby in pram, no car, no big supermarkets, just small and friendly shops. I loved the humour about the gear shift!-I had forgotten that gear shifts were sometimes on the steering column-my uncle used to have a van like that. I loved reading about Becky's crafting and thought, 'just like I did!'-I also used to knit and crochet my own dolls clothes and even made clothes for the next door neighbour's grandson's Action Man dolls. I had forgotten about this and this book brought it all back to me. It's lovely to hear about all this, people just don't hand-down these activities to their children and grandchildren anymore. Rarely anyway. Lovely nostalgia all through this book for me and I also learned about what it would be like to be an Air force wife, something I knew nothing about before. Becky's books are unique in bringing back all those magical moments. Another engaging read, (I read it in one sitting), accurate and a lovely presentation all-round. A comforting read about contented times and simple pleasures. So much warmth really comes across in Becky Corwin-Adams' writing. Very special.",Lovely little book-BIG content!,1396483200,,

Lucky is a fascinating heroine who develops professionally and emotionally throughout the story. Lucky is almost a free spirit; she's not afraid to go after what she wants, to take a chance, to start things and then stop them - aka quit - when they're no longer what she wants. She's strong and brave, generous and loyal to a fault. She's the kind of woman you want to be on your side when the world is falling to pieces.

While I liked James - an arrogant hottie who can cook, what's not to love there? - I would have liked more depth to his character. Although he has this serious tragedy and other heavy stuff in his past it's not really explored.

My Rating: 5/5 stars
My Review:

Slade Martin is about as badass as they come.  He is a super-simple guy with two total and complete desires.  Desire one is mixed martial arts and the dream of one day owning his own gym.  Slade is, quite literally willing to put his life on the line to make this dream come true.  Desire two is Jessica Cross, the woman Slade has adored for quite some time yet hasn't ever really been able to get close to.  Like his dream of owning a gym, Slade is willing to put his life on the line and give up his freedom for Jessica.

Jessica Cross never intended to be a statistic.  From a wealthy family who have high expectations for their daughter and her life, Jessica hasn't told her family the real reason she broke things off with her boyfriend, Dennis.  As far as Jessicas parents are concerned, Dennis, with his charm, family connections, and political aspirations is the perfect match for Jessica.  What they don't know is that Dennis is bat-shit crazy and likes to beat Jessica.  Slade Martin knows all these things and wants nothing more than to hurt Dennis, protect Jessica, and make her his own.  Given her recent experiences, Jessica is beyond hesitant to jump into a new relationship but there is just something about Slade that is hard to resist.  With nearly everyone else, Slade is big, bad, and scary but with Jessica, he is kind, caring, intensely sexual, and hugely protective.

Slade never imagined when he finally got Jessica into his life and into his home it would be because she is recuperating from a serious beating at the hands of her ex-boyfriend.  Bringing Jessica deeper into his life is one of Slades greatest desires and while he is generally a fairly aggressive guy, Jessica needs something far different.  With Jessica, Slade taps into the parts of his personality that don't normally see the light of day.  As an MMA fighter, Slade gets to let his anger and aggression out but with Jessica, he gets to be gentle and caring, and just aggressive enough in the bedroom to completely satisfy each other.  More surprisingly, Slade quickly realizes he doesnt just want a little bit of time and a lot of sex with Jessica but a whole hell of a lot of each.

Now lets add some drama into the mix.  Jessica has to deal with not just her recovery but the choices she made to get her to her current place in life.  She has to deal with her family and her future and how disparate the two really are.  Then, there is the fact that her ex is still causing some fairly serious problems for both she and Slade.  From Jessicas perspective, it is all just too much to bear and the easiest and most heartbreaking solution for all involved is simply to leave town.  Jessica is only half of Slades drama.  He wants her desperately but he also wants his own gym.  With Jessica, he is facing jail time as a result of a confrontation with her crazy ex as well as facing her leaving town.  With his dream of owning a gym, Slade is facing a lack of funds which can easily be remedied with just a few more unsanctioned, high risk fights.  However, he has been fighting for a lot of years and the injuries are adding up to the point that one more serious blow and Slade is in the realm of long-term irreversible damage or even death.  Like Jessica, some things are just worth the time, the effort, and the risk.

The Bottom Line:  The title, Full Contact really does epitomize Slade Martin.  From start to finish, Slade is full tilt and focused on his two goals, getting enough money to buy a gym and making Jessica his.  Slade is so focused on these goals that he often disregards even his own well-being and while that may seem stupid (and it is on some levels) is also an expression of his confidence.  Slade has confidence in spades and that is very much a part of his appeal.  His foul mouth and absolute determination make him sexy as hell and when you throw in all the crap he has to go through and the opposition he faces, well, Slade is just about perfect.  One of the awesome ironies of this read is how often Slade says he doesnt do drama but there is a butt load of drama in his life and in this read.  Every single bit of the drama makes sense to the read and particularly to Jessica and speaks to Slades character.  That Slade is willing to endure the drama he so despises for the realization of his dream and an HEA is a delightful irony that I chuckled about many, many times throughout this read.",Like his dream of owning a gym,1459555200,,

Not all of them would be the type that you would necessarily see hanging together. Actually, Cameron is the type you would not see hanging with anyone. The story goes back and forth from uni days with the four of them to Cameron's present day. Then one day they are all invited to the unveiling of one of the four friend's newest wine. While there, they reminisce about uni days and a secret known by three of them comes out to the worst damaged of the four of them.

I really enjoyed reading this and was definitely kept interested. The characters were all pretty likable except for Tommie. I didn't and still don't like him. And his dad should have done more at that coffee shop meeting towards the end of the book other than just offer up his condolences. Cameron was done wrong in SO many ways.

This was an emotional ride wherein I felt mixed emotions for all the characters at times. I found it to be a great read and I seriously recommend it!!

Lexi and Luccas love affair goes through its ups and downs (more ups than downs) as Lexi begins to feel confident in her own skin. Everyone is fascinated with the woman who has captured Lucca Carusos heart, and there are some people who want to throw a wrench into that happiness.

Luccas as dashing and romantic as ever, but as a reader, you get to see more of him as a person and not just as the Italian god.

She is truly his whole world and its a passionate love you hope to find in your life or with your partner.

Im glad I have given this story a chance  although there are a lot of BDSM elements, its still a sweet book, one of the reasons I like Katie Ashleys writing so much.

A prime piece of submissive man like this usually belonged to someone. And if he didnt, he would normally be snatched up by a Domme practically before he got through the door, least of all across the dance floor. I couldn't help wondering what his story was. More than anything, I wondered what it might be like to have a session with him.

Sophie Jameson has finished her education and is about to begin her professional career; working as an English teacher at her half-brothers high school. During her study Sophie supported herself  and her family  by working as a Dominatrix at an exclusive SM club. While she enjoys her work and the money she makes, Sophie is a professional Dominatrix, not a lifestyle one. This means she doesnt have sex with her clients, and they are not allowed to touch her in any way. Sophie is good at what she does, but where her clients get a sexual rel***e during the sessions, Sophie doesnt feel anything. On her last day at Club 1740 Sophie meets William Foster, a handsome male submissive, and for the first time in five years, she starts to feel something during a session.

Hmm, have my unwanted overtures made the usually mouthy Domme speechless? I tore my gaze away from my hands to look at him. Im sorry, but you did take me a little off guard. This entire day has taken me off guardmore than anything, you take me off guard. I do?

When Sophie meets William on her last day at Club 1740, and he asks her for a session, to her surprise she agrees. What starts out as a normal session for Sophie, it soon turns into a whole new experience for her. Meeting each other again outside the Club  in real life  leads to spending time together and other sessions, growing the attraction they feel for one another. Sophie decides to stop seeing William, being a teacher and a part of the BDSM world don't mix in her mind. Although Sophie and William have had hot, passionate sex, they don't share a lot about their personal lives and occupations. To her disbelief, Sophie meets William again during her first day at school. The couple tries to fight the pull between them, but in the end they decide to give their love for each other a real chance.

Sophie is a strong girl who knows what she wants and does all she can for her for her loved ones, her dad and her younger half-brother. Because her father is suffering from a terrible decease, she does all she can to help out financially, lifting at least that burden from his shoulders. But how she makes her money is something Sophie keeps hidden, she isn't ashamed of what she does, but she knows a lot of people aren't that open-minded. Subordination is told from Sophies point of view (POV), therefor we only see her reasoning, her way of thinking. Since I read a lot of books in a dual POV  other books by Katie Ashley are also in a dual POV  I somehow miss the look inside Williams mind.

You don't have to be afraid. But even if you are, Ill be strong enough for both of us. I surveyed the intensity of his expression. I know you would walk through fire for me, and not because it was the request of your Mistress. It would be because you love me. I brought my mouth to his. After a tender kiss, I murmured, And I love you, against his lips.

1737017,4,False,"04 8, 2013",A1TVYIMMABO17Z,B00C2RE6LI,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Heidi,"Gemma has the perfect life. She lives in perfection: Heaven. She is an angel after all. If everything is so perfect, why does she feel drawn to Earth with all of its imperfections and complexities? After completing a mission, Gemma lazily idles by a stream. Watching the water whirl and swirl as it whispers across the river bed. Butterflies flit and float all around her, and Gemma cannot help but enjoy this stolen time. A sharp snap of a branch breaking startles Gemma from her quiet reverie. An unknown man stands watching her. Gemma decides to check it out. A bad decision as she is attacked by a large hellish hound with red eyes. After scuffling, Gemma stabs the creature in the heart with her dagger and escapes back to the stream. A quiet voice asks if she is harmed, and Gemma sees another human. Terrified, she attempts to flee, but something holds her back and she lets this man help her. Back in heaven, Gemma finds her thoughts turning back to the stranger, and before she knows it she is sneaking back to see him. Unfortunately, a relationship between an angel and a human is forbidden, and Gemma will soon face dire consequences. What will the price be for losing her heart to the wrong man?
What I Liked:
*Gemma has always been of the most enigmatic characters of the Heven and Hell series. Since her introduction in Charade, she has remained elusive and tight lipped and there has been very little revelation about her past and her former existence as an angel. Finally, the reader is able to get inside her head and learn her secrets and gain an understanding as to why she is emotionally scarred and reclusive and see what motivates her. Her story is sad, as we learn she is punished for a forbidden love. It makes you stop and think: What would you be willing to give up for love? What price would you pay?
*I liked that this novella takes us back to the past, and then brings us forward to present day, where Gemma is still struggling with her past. She is unable to forget and unwilling to open her heart to Cole. Knowing her backstory, it is now easy to understand why she is so afraid why she continues to push Cole away. Thankfully, Cole doesn't take rejection easily, and he is willing to prove just how far he will go to be with her. Of course, we are left in breathless agony wondering about the couple's fate, and it won't be revealed until the final installment, Renegade, releases in May 2013.
*It was interesting to get a glimpse into Heaven. We have taken a trip to Hell in the previous books, and this time around it was nice to gain a perspective on the heavenly realm.
*Cambria's writing is lovely as usual. This novella especially was packed full of wonderful descriptions and plenty of emotion. I always enjoy Cambria's unique voice and this was my second favorite novella in the series, behind Bewitched. What can I say? I like Kimber's sassy personality.
*Usually, I am disappointed in the short length of a novella, but this time around, I thought the little story packed plenty of punch and I got all the information I needed and was left satisfied. That is saying something because usually I want more. This novella was like a tasty little snack that tided me over until Renegade.
And The Not So Much:
*I was a bit confused over the time period of Gemma's story. It revealed that she is very old, and that she has been wandering the Earth for a long time since her fall, but her story regarding her fall seems to take place not that long ago, as the love interest Callum has a motorcycle and wears jeans. I was under the impression that the events in the past had occurred a long time, since Riley is a descendant and he is older, again this indicates that quite a few years have passed.
*I was a bit perplexed that when Gemma's wings were stripped that she wasn't given any kind of way to redeem herself. Her punishment is swift and harsh. Humans always have a chance to redeem themselves, why can't an angel? I am hopeful that in the final book Gemma will receive her redemption.

Beneath is a revealing and heartbreaking look at how a young angel fell for falling in love with the wrong person. This is a quick, satisfying read that will hold you over until the final novel of The Heven and Hell Series: Regenade is released in May.

Favorite Quotations:
""This doesnt have to damn you. What you did... you changed... out of love, not out of darkness. That is what will save you. That is what will save us.
""I didn't say anything. I was afraid to. I was afraid if I opened my mouth, then all the feelings that were swimming around inside me would escape and once the truth was out, it would change everything.""
""From everything Ive seen and heard from Kimber, she wasn't just one crayon short of a full box; she was just the empty box.""
Tell me what the price is to love you. Ill pay it.
""I would hear those words in my sleep. I would hear them in the sunrise and when the stars sparkled in the sky. They would be there always, whispering directly to my heart, following me wherever I would go, and even if I spent eternity alone, those words would forever wrap around my soul and keep me from ever feeling alone. To him, those words had been a plea, but to me... they were everything.""
""The passion that erupted between us was unlike anything Id ever known, and I would never be the same again. When I could think again, I would realize that I would never again miss my wings, I would never again miss heaven, because this kiss, his hands, his skin, and his body were the only things I would ever want again.""

Hubbard,"Even though this is ninth (!) installment of the series, it seems to have some plots points that the author's been sitting on ever since finishing the very first book.  Either that or he's good at making stuff up to fill in plot holes.  If it's the former case, he should be commended for his patience; if it's the latter, I can only shrug my shoulders.
I imagine it's not easy to make a series about a magic boarding school stay fresh and relevant, but Chris does it even in the main character's fifth school year.  It's too bad the story isn't as compelling or suspenseful as previous entries.  Although exploring the history of the Whitehall magic school is interesting, the author gives a huge clue to an upcoming plot twist early on and thus limits the sense of mystery.  Emily, the main character, is also once again butting heads with authority figures, but there's not enough passion and outrage behind it this time around.  There's also a whodunit mystery that ultimately acts as mere filler.  I'll admit, I incorrectly guessed who was ""doing it,"" but as it is, it made me simply shrug.
I think I preferred it when Emily went through Martial Magic class, kicking butt and taking names (even though she hardly kicked any butt).

There's all that biting and primal sexin' going on that the two of them hardly know which way is up. Which is just the way I like my vampires and werewolves, as it turns out.

I completely dig the ""bad guys are bad bad bad"" vibe we have going here. Seriously, the twisted vamps (and wolves, if I'm going to be fair) who revel in causing a little extra pain and misery with their torture are creepy in the extreme. Which makes me love to hate them.

I enjoyed this contemporary romance which deals with some serious issues. Themes are the self-imposed burden of guilt stopping people from leading free lives, and the responsibility faced by adoptive parents.  We also learn about fire safety in various environments. This distinctive feature will secure the tale a place on keeper shelves; this book might even save a life.

Taking a teaching job in small New Mexico town Whistle Stop is the first step to liberation for Ella; she has been self-conscious about burn scars on her arms, gained during a fire in the family home. She carries survivor's guilt and considers that she may be partly to blame for the fire. Ella gradually makes friends during the course of the story.  One is Tony, a rancher and volunteer fire fighter. He's in the process of proving himself a suitable guardian to adopt his orphaned nephew and offers to be Ella's dance partner in a forthcoming contest if she'll tutor the boy, Johnny. The contest prize fund would help Ella to repair the roof of her cabin. Tony bears his own share of regrets at not being a responsible family member sooner in his life, and his previous girlfriend dumped him when he took on adult responsibilities.

I did think that Ella spent far too much time thinking that she mustn't get involved with Tony, and some conversations were somewhat forced in between other scenes. Also, when I travelled in the Southwest I recall a great deal of sunscreen, sunglasses, water bottles, air conditioning in cars; and sweaters for when I walked into a building and got the full blast of the arctic air conditioning. The atmosphere, native plant species and wildlife, could come across more strongly. Nobody warns Johnny to guard his puppy from coyotes and snakes. But maybe that's just me.

Ella is determined to clear a fire break around her cabin, and the tension-filled last part of the book demonstrates the validity of her efforts.  If you enjoy romantic suspense, tales with kids and dogs or a series set in a small town, A Moment To Dance will have you kicking up your heels to its lively beat. This romance is suitable for adults and young adults; I recommend it.",A moment to dance,1456704000,,

I loved the heroine and only wanted the best for her and here is where I think I am in the minority.  I don't think Stephen was the best choice for Hannah.  First he had some thing or someone to get over.  Honestly, I hated that issue more than anything in the story, but I was willing, but then Stephen goes and says something hurtful without much remorse.  Hannah being the kind and caring Hannah forgives too easily.  Stephen coming by and saying sorry (while another woman is in the car waiting for him) is not groveling to me.  What made it worse is I don't think Stephen really felt that bad about his hurtful words.  He said he felt bad, but I did not buy it.  Anyway this happens very early in the story and then there are other things that happen that cause tension and stuff to the story, but I think in back of my mind I was yelling at Hannah to  let him go with the he does not deserve you and  close with the he needs to get over it.
There was nothing wrong with the writing.  This did not work for me because of the connection, but it may work for you.  When I read these types of books, I want to feel the strong attraction following with the strong intense moments.  I do not want insta-love, insta-sex, but I want the strong connection.

119456,5,True,"04 24, 2013",A10DX94ATZQEFG,B006XZ2FC2,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Malinda,"This was a really great story (I'd give it 4 1/2 stars). I've read Suzanne's two books from the Phoenix Pack series and this is story is different from those 2 in the fact that there's no paranormal stuff in this story. It takes place in a completely ordinary world. It is similar to Phoenix Pack books in the fact that is has a strong, caring and intelligent female lead and a possessive, dominating male lead.

The writing of this story is very interesting in that the PoV travels between characters in the book. We see Connor and Jaxxon's PoVs but also the PoV of other characters giving better insight and a more complete story. I don't usually see stories written this way but this one was well done and I liked the way it enhanced the story.

I really liked Jaxxon. She grew up in the foster care system and had a very rough life. She's been through hell and closed herself off in a lot of ways but yet she still is caring enough to help out others that deserve it (stray animals, abused wives and kids, etc...).

Jaxxon and Connor were in the same foster home when they were young and formed a bond. He got out of foster care a couple years before her (this takes place in the UK and they get out at 16 years old there...weird..). Connor had looked out for Jaxxon and protected her from the local bullies that wanted to do bad things to her but then it came time for him to leave foster care. He told Jaxxon he'd come back to visit her, gave her her first kiss and then left. He never went back.

Jaxxon had an older sister (Leah) that wasn't kind to her and when Leah got out of foster care she lied about some things and made Jaxxon believe bad things about Connor. Leah also abandoned Jaxxon and she was alone from the age of 14. She grew up and 8 years later was still struggling in the slums and working in a bar when she's ""discovered"". She's never been interested in modeling but figures it's worth seeing where it goes because she can't get worse than where she is and she becomes famous almost overnight.

Connor left the foster care system and ended up in the Formula 1 racing. He became a big deal and had money and women but never considered any kind of relationship with anyone. He happened to see a cover of a magazine that Jaxxon was on and he remembers her. All the old memories come flooding in and he decides to call her. He leaves a message and she doesn't call him back so he begins pursuing her. He's so in denial it's almost funny...at first he tells himself he just wants to see her as friends catching up, then he wants to sleep with her but just one time, then it's more than once but nothing serious, and on and on. Connor swore to himself he'd never get married or have a family (for reasons we don't find out about until the end) and he's determined he won't be good for Jaxxon long term but he can't not be with her.

Jaxxon doesn't want to get involved with Connor. She knows it's just a recipe for her getting hurt. Unfortunately she also can't resist Connor and decides to try to protect her heart as well as she can. This doesn't work as well as hoped and they find themselves getting deeper with each other.

Jaxxon has more things going on than just the issues with Connor though. She has a stalker that's been trying to harm her that provides some complications and danger for Jaxxon. Connor goes to help her when her stalker attacks and you'd think he'd come to his senses after she'd been in danger but he doesn't. I have to say that Connor does suffer from multiple bouts of stupidness about his feelings/relationship in this story. So, when it was clear that Connor still wouldn't consider trying for more of a relationship, Jaxxon ended things and went on a promotional tour for her job.

Of course with this being a romance, things come together for Connor and Jaxxon but I won't spoil it with the details. Lets just say that Connor figured out what a dummy he was and goes to hunt Jaxxon down. I really liked the ending and I finished the story with a happy satisfied feeling. This was a great story. I'd recommend it. Thumbs up! :D",Great story :D,1366761600,,

Synopsis: Simone White has a problem--her money is about to run out, and, oh yes, she doesn't start her new job for an entire three weeks. But Simone also has a roommate named Jacque, who suggests that Simone use her beauty to get a rich boyfriend. Simone has to decide between her pride and her need for money.

Will Marcus is a freelance writer who just hit the jackpot thanks to the deal he made with a movie studio to adapt his book into a screen play. His agent persuades him to go out and celebrate. After all, a payday this huge doesn't come along every day.

Featuring some of his best dialogue ever and his most explicit writing yet, this latest interracial romp from veteran writer Jon Bradbury will keep you turning the pages.

This is the first time I have read a book written by a man from a female's perspective and I'll have to admit he did a really awesome job. I won't go so far as to say he completely understands the female psyche but he does a damn good job of conveying our rollercoaster of emotions.
I thought it was a very interesting story, although I would have liked more interaction between the characters and less clothing descriptions. I mean don't get me wrong what girl doesn't love fashion, but I felt that it kind of took away from the main story.
Aside from the endless fashion parade the only other issue I had was that I felt like it was too short. I'm not saying I wanted them to get married, have six kids and live happily ever after. But I guess I wanted to see more of a relationship between them.
Overall I did really like it. It was a great quick read.
That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.

The cover is amazing and the is yummy. I mean look at those abs. Yes, I wanted to read this for a superficial reason. Now I need to share my thoughts.

Honestly, I struggle with No Apologies. I really didn't have a problem with Graham being a manwhore. I mean it's his prerogative to be one, after all he's a musician and he's living up the benefits. However, I he was moody and an a-hole. I think if he was more charming, I would be more forgiving for his manwhore behavior. He's not, and he's a hard character to love and he has no qualms being an a-hole.

You kind of get to know Carly. Yes, she's a bartender at a bar that Graham frequents, and likes to see her. Graham has these lusty feelings for her, but senses that he should stay away from. I guess that's one of Graham's good quality, but he can't seem to stay way. As you read the story, you learn that Carly is a wounded character, so I can understand  her skittish nature.

No Apologies is written from Graham POV. I do like when it's from a male POV. However, the story is not a cheery one, it's pretty dark and gritty. Graham outlook on life is pretty grim. All he focuses on is tapping whatever chick crosses his path and shoving them out the door when he's done. If you don't mind an a-hole guy who's a bit of a manwhore with a chip on his shoulder, this is a book for you. Yes,  he does develop some redeeming qualities, but just not enough to balance a-hole persona at the beginning of the book. This is just my thoughts on the story, and it just didn't work for me. I know it has worked for the others and I'm glad they enjoyed it.

Now vengeance for his father is a different game altogether, one he is sworn to play. But can he keep up with the killer and stay alive himself?

He had promised to come back but that hadn't happened. Anna is struggling to get on with her life. Then out of the blue an FBI agent appears with Nick and forces her to help hide Prince Nicholas. She's shocked. How could he lie to her? I enjoyed this continuation of Anna and Nick's romance. What started in A Royal Christmas finishes in this book. Anna is a feisty woman who knows how to put the Prince in his place. I laughed as Nick struggled with everyday chores such as making meals or washing clothes. Nick is a charming royal who loves Anna and wants to make peace with her. He has his work cut out for him. Their interaction made for a charming and humorous romance. I loved returning to Daleville.

Wow. What a story!!! The first chapter had me crying into my pillow. I had to stop because I had this sneaky suspicion I was gonna cry a lot and I wasn't wrong. What I was wrong about was that this one made me giggle a lot too. It was a perfect blend of the funny and heartbreak.

We meet Joe on a heartbreaking night and his story is going to stomp on your heart and leave you unable to breathe. Writing about the first chapter is making me choke up. So I am going to move on to Molly. Holy Batman in heaven!!! This gal is a force to reckon with. She's sassy, she's funny and she's fearless, well at least that's how it seemed but there were deeper waters that we needed to dive into. I loved her. I honestly wanted to eat her food. Oh yeah. She is a CHEF. God I wish some of the recipes were available online for this book. I cried and wanted to hug her when her past was revealed a little at a time I feel more in love with her. I felt her pain and her sorrow and her anguish and her feeling of helplessness. And I honestly wanted to pulverize one particular character. Douche-bag really need to go dive off into the deepest end of the ocean and be fish bait.

Back to Joe, because if I start talking about all the things I wanna do to douche-bag!!! Joe was to die for. He's officially one of my top book boyfriends even with all his hang-ups and anger issues. Boy, does he have anger issues. Can't really blame a man who's lost something so precious that it's a wonder that he survived the tragedy. From the first chapter I had wondered about Jess and slowly it was revealed. The truth was hard to swallow but Joe couldn't really do anything about it. Death is easy, it's the living that is hard.

So Joe and Molly meet after a long hiatus so to speak and both have had a hard life and this was their story. They both struggled with their past and tried to fight their attraction and longing. Their chemistry fairly sizzled the screen, I really loved how Joe felt about her. That in turn made me fall in love with him. But the journey isn't straight forward, nothing in life is. But fate is both a cruel and amazing thing. You cannot fight it.
This story is beautifully written, it's sweet and heartbreaking and for me it was a solid 5 star. If you wanna know if sweet and sassy Molly get's her sexy and hot creator of awesome wood, Joe, then move onto Mollywood.

Mollywood
So Mollywood is book 2 in the series Carved Hearts and we met Molly and Joe in Good Wood. The story continues from not exactly where we left off in book 1. It's months after book 1. Molly and Joe like every couple that come together are struggling to find a niche for each other. They fight and they annoy each other but their love for each other never comes into question.

While all this is happening the BIG SURPRISE is revealed and I could not be more ecstatic or more scared. I mean it's a blessing yet at the same time is it the right time. Well it seems they don't have a choice. Joe being the guy he is made me wanna scream. His reticence and his inner monologues frustrated the heck out of me, I wanted to go up to him and SHAKE him. Wanted to tell him that it was okay to think all these and then some. But finally I shed tears of relief at the family get-together.

Molly was just as frustrating as Joe, her thoughts made me wanna weep harder. And I wanted to wrap her up and tell her that she is sooo wrong. But these two beautiful souls did have a rough life and it's not really hard to understand why they think the way they think. It's just sad. And then the whole cemetery scene was sooo heartbreaking. God!!!

Joe and his father, then the white Christmas and the whole scene after. OMG!!! It was soooooooooo pretty and beautiful and perfect. When all things were going well and things have calmed some, the call came and my world shattered. I had to stop cause I wasn't sure I would survive like Joe. And then the cemetery scene again and I read a few lines and I wanted to throw my Kindle. So if you are curious at this point to find out if Joe gets his girl, Molly, then move to Heartwood.

Heartwood
To say this one was a emotionally huge roller-coaster ride would be an understatement. I've been Joe's and Molly's life since Good Wood. I fell irrevocably in love with these and have been wanting their HEA from the beginning. They have both been through hell and back and they deserved their Happy Ever After.

Heartwood starts off with the couple's impending nuptials and their life with their adorable twin babies, Logan and Eva. Watch these two with their kids made me go all gooey inside. It was beautiful and sweet. I wanted to dive into the book and go get my own fix of Logan & Eva.

While I was ecstatic about the doll-babies there were creepy things going around. The laser-tag incident, the speeding cars and shadowy figures in the dark of night was freaking me out. The big day came and I was a bawling mess. Francis, Mac and everything made my all mushy and weeepy. There are people who are invisible to us because of who they have become in life but all it takes is a simple kind gesture and you can change someone's life. All it takes is kindness and compassion. I cried reading this part. You'll know what I am talking about when you reach the part. Mac dancing with you know who was one of the most beautiful scenes will always remember and get weepy over.

Then Molly and Joe went away and I read all the things they did and their conversations and everything, I felt a happy blanket envelop me in its warm cocoon. But at the back of my mind, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. They came back and my mind refused to accept the words. I want chanting and hugging my pillow, ""NO. NO. NO. NO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. EFFFING NOOOOO.""

What transpired was something I never thought was possible. How is this happening? Why is this happening? That vile creature was whacked, seriously how no one saw it was unbelievable. What Molly endured and that little angle. OMG!!! When that a-hole monster threw... ... I cannot write about it. And then Joe and his inner monologues and Molly and her struggle. I freaking loved this story and although it wrecked me I realized while reading the series that I am in fact a glutton for heartache and that I love stories that break my heart.

Carved Hearts series would take you on a ride that you will not want to come out of and YOU would want to pray and beg the Almighty for the chance of an HEA for Joe and Molly. The story was heart-stoppingly awesome to say the least, the hearts that were carved were beautiful and the souls that inspired such words were indeed epically wonderous. I leave with my heart and soul lost in the sea of Carved Hearts with a solid 5 freaking gold stars.","An emotional 5 star ride that was sweet, beautiful and heartbreaking",1449878400,3,

If not, then you will in this adorable non-rhyming picture book. Elliot's New Friends by Justin Lambert will have you laughing out loud while reading this fun story about friendship and acceptance. Elliot is a not-so-little elephant who has dreams of exploring life outside of his waterhole. Since he has spent his entire life with other elephants, Elliot assumes the creatures he meets must also be some very strange looking elephants. He starts out by judging the other creatures based on their looks. Eventually, he realizes that he was wrong to judge them and searches throughout the land for new unique friends who all have something about them that makes them uniquely special.

The ideal audience for this book is for children in 1st grade to 4th--even though it is marketed to younger groups. The language is a little too hard for new readers to sit and try to read this without assistance. However, I do feel those younger audiences would love the adorable illustrations and the silly actions of Elliot and his friends.

While my oldest daughter enjoyed the message the author conveyed, my younger two enjoyed the dialogue and the pictures.

Then, I kind of began to stalk her online and read each of her stories I could make time to read in the middle of all my writing adventures and snafus, which I won't go into here because this review is all about Ms. Blue.

When Ms. Blue began writing Under His Kilt, I remember that particular phase in her life when she was enamored by everything that had to do with Scots. I even posted a pic of a guy in a kilt to feed into her obsession. Little did I know she was writing the book that would seal the deal for me. I loved the writing of Melissa Blue from day one, but I was not prepared for the fact that she had written the book that would make me bow down to her like Wayne and Garth in Waynes World and proclaim, Were not worthy!
Under His Kilt is the best erotic romance novella I have ever read, bar none. And I know this is saying a lot, but bear with me. Not only does she deliver fully formed awesome characters that you care about from beginning to end, but she stuffs so much plot, so much character development, so much hotness and hot sex (oh my gawd!), into this itty bitty book, I found myself being jealous of the skill in which she crafted this story. The conflict was perfect and not contrived or overblown, and the characters behaved exactly as they should without drifting out of character. She draws you in from page one and never lets up. Okay, now let me stop gushing like a writer and get on with this review.

Jocelyn an assistant museum curator who is soon to turn thirty has devised a bucket list, of sorts, of things she desires to do before the momentous occasion. One is, she wants to have some toe-curling, core-clenching, star-producing sex with a man who knows what the hell hes doing. In fact, after she makes this known to consultant Ian Baird, both she and he realize post haste, given their volatile sexual chemistry from the first day they met, it is his assistance she desires in getting this item ticked off her list. Theres only one problem. They work together. And that is a rule he has not broken since becoming the mature, well-traveled and worldly museum consultant he is. Yet, something about the wee bonnie lass, Jocelyn, has him breaking all the rules. Throw in a cute puppy named, Lexxie, and Ian doesnt know what hit him.

I could share more of this story, and I could use a boatload of flowery adjectives to describe just how wonderful it is, but I think Ill let you go read it and see for yourself. Under His Kilt delivers a grown, sexy and intelligent story that I never wanted to see end. Go ahead, one-click. I defy anyone to try and prove me wrong.

What a beautiful relationship we had.

I LOVED I See London.

There was no need for me to get into it as I read, I was completely hooked from the first sentence and absorbed throughout the whole book.  I cannot believe this was Chanels debut novel.  It is that good.

I loved all of the characters: Maggie, Samir, Fleur, Mya, and all the rest of them.  They all played off of each other well and this book wouldnt have been the same without every single one of them.

As the book starts, Maggie, our heroine, is leaving someone after a (obviously) hot night.  She tells them that she will see them next year.  Then we go back to what led up to that moment for the rest of the book.

I have decided that I love books that start like that.  They give you this piece of information to unravel as you read, wondering what is going to happen to lead up to that moment.

Maggie had a dream of graduating from high school and going off to Harvard.  Fortunately for us, Harvard rejected her so she headed off to the International School in London.

When she arrives in London we quickly meet Samir, and then Fleur, and then the story hits the ground running.

The chemistry that is between Samir and Maggie burns up the pages.  Maggie doesnt want to admit to that attraction, or not having ever had a boyfriend, doesnt even know really what she is feeling, so she starts to date Hugh, the older man who in the beginning is completely up front about not wanting anything serious.  I cant tell you if it turned serious, but it was a fun ride to be on.

Samir seems like the ultimate playboy, the kind who is all about fun and with a different girl every night (you wonder why Maggie denies her attraction), but without even saying the words Chanel tells us that Samir is so much deeper than that.  There is definitely more than meets the eye with Samir.

It was an amazing coming of age story that left me wanting to go to London.  Ive always wanted to go to Scotland, but London has never been on bucket list until now.  Chanel gives us a real taste of what it is like to be a student in London from starting out as a tourist to becoming more of a resident.

I cannot wait for London Falling.  It is coming July 7 according to Amazon.  I really am not sure if I can wait that long.  I suppose I will have to, but man, waiting

To be honest I wasn't sure how much I was going to enjoy this book as I'm not usually a fan of futuristic type storylines but this story pleasantly surprised me. Set in about 50 years from now the world has changed and advanced but at the same time many things have remained the same. The story is intriguing and unique and definitely not what I was expecting when I read the blurb but I quickly became engrossed in the story and the relationship dynamic between Ian & Amelia.

I found the sex erotic and off the charts hot as the author vividly depicts the sensual acts Ian & Amelia embark upon together. While the sexual relationship starts quite quickly in the story it was in line with the plot and without spoiling anything, Amelia's characters history has a lot to do with it.

While there are some parts of the book I tried to wrap my head around and imagine what kind of world the author was envisaging as she wrote the book, most of the time I felt like I was reading a romance that could be set in our current time - so not too futuristic.

Josie Litton has a wonderful way in painting the scene of her futuristic world with her descriptive and enchanting words. While this is the first book I've read by Josie Litton it won't be my last and I'm looking forward to reading about the rest of Ian & Amelia's story in book #2 - Hunted :)",Intriguing Storyline with Vivid & Erotic Sex Scenes!!!,1421020800,,

Eve is all set to head out to the islands for Christmas  far, far away from all the reminders of this particular holiday.  Yes, shed been stood up at the alter on her supposed to be Christmas Eve wedding, but that really turned out for the best.  Marrying for the wrong reasons shouldnt count.  But now, this year her business partner had accepted a wedding to tale place on Christmas Eve of this year  there was no way that Eve would do this, contract or not.  No Way.  But Santa might have something to say about that

Eve is convinced that this is all a Christmas hoax, but she knows one man who could get to the truth of the whole thing.  Hunter.  An investigative reporter and the man she loved  the man who every single time picks the story of a lifetime over her.  So shes done with all that and him.  But for this mystery she needs the best to help her figure out what is going on  and Hunter is the best at what he does.

It was such fun, returning to Christmas Central this year for another charming Christmas magic story.  Eves Christmas Wedding is a fun, charming and giggle worthy story of true love gone wrong and having the biggest magic maker of all step in to help.  Although I have to say the elves kinda stole the show on this one, their antics were definitely the laugh I needed myself.

Hunter and Eve belong together, and Hunter has finally realized what he lost when Eve left him.  Now he has the chance to prove to her just how willing he is to put her first in all things until the moment another story is handed to him.  Will he make the right choice this time?

I suggest you go pick up Eves Christmas Wedding and find out for yourself.  A delightfully whimsical Christmas romance that you won't want to miss.  Yeah, Id definitely recommend this one for this years reading list and to re-read in the years ahead.",Loved returning to Christmas Central for this charming romance,1450742400,,

Mike is a good guy and goes around the world skiing year-round. It seems odd to be skiing June through September, but that's what he does in New Zealand. Mike takes charge organizing the team for the annual race and he's a very good leader. He's able to handle different personalities and does well in times of stress and unexpected mishaps.

Jude's situation is still a little of a mystery to me. Her husband is in New Zealand and she's running the ski school in Scotland. She seems to be jumping into her role as the boss, yet she still suffers from insecurities.

The race itself was exciting and I loved watching it unfold, especially after all the build up.

While in high school, newbie Joe Fuller was behind in math, so Abbi Hayes, nerd and math genius extraordinaire, tutored him. Now years later they meet again and Joe returns the favor, with a slightly different lesson plan.  Abbi is a curvy and attractive computer expert, in the process of developing an application for women that will provide tips on how to get a man's attention and keep him interested.  Of course sex is a component of the app and this is where Abbi's skills are severely lacking. All the research in the world will not usurp real-time sexual experience, so playboy Joe offers to tutor Abbi in the fine art of seduction.

Joe's good looks, charm and athleticism have served him well, especially where the female population is concerned.  His blossoming relationship with Abbi tests his bachelorhood belief system. In addition, he is now a successful businessman, on the verge of expanding his personal training facility into a chain.

Abbi and Joe are tremendously steamy in the bedroom, on the counter and against the wall.  Joe's expert tutelage transforms Abbi into a confident sexual vixen. And although Abbi is the student, she ends up teaching Joe a few things about love, commitment and need. The lessons become blurred as their feelings and desires take over.

Wow, talk about a well-written festival of lust, complete with an emotional story that may cause a few tears. I immediately connected with Abbi and Joe and enjoyed their sexual adventure together.  The secondary characters are unique in their own right and add a ton of background story to the present happenings.  Ms. Anderson is a very talented writer and I look forward to becoming engrossed in her world once again with her next book.

Meredith who has gained her solid reputation as a mystery and romance novelist through her many novels and also through her participation in writers conferences and seminars at The Governors Sesquicentennial Conference on Literary Arts at the University of North Texas, Emporia State University, Rice University, University of Texas at Dallas, University of Nebraska at Lincoln, West Texas State A& M University, as well as speaking on panels with Western Writers of America, Bouchercon, Malice Domestic, and Romance Writers of America. She is a member of Western Writers of America, Sisters in Crime, Mystery Writers of America, and The American Crime Writers League, and from her home in Amarillo, Texas she continues to pen mystery series set in the Texas Panhandle and elsewhere. Meredith is the book review editor for ROUNDUP MAGAZINE. Impressive!

A factor that enhances the reading experience is a note from the author at a books opening, offering some background for the stimuli that blossoms into a story. Meredith agrees and states, To those curious souls who may visit the Panhandle-Plains Museum in Canyon, Texas, expecting to find it as I described it in Murder by Reference will be disappointed. Pioneer Town is still there, but has been updated, renovated, otherwise changed from what it was when I wrote of John Lloyd's and Lydia's adventures. Sarah Jane is real if you choose to believe the stories that have floated about through the years, unacknowledged by university and museum personnel. If you don't believe in ghosts, consider suspending your disbelief at least while reading the book. Like John Lloyd, Sarah Jane exists only if you believe in her. The stacks were at the time I wrote the book exactly as I described. When I toured that area with the museum director at that time, two mannequins loomed out of the darkness and scared the very devil out of both of us. I couldn't resist using the episode. There really was a room lost during the various renovations to the museum over the years. A staff member who had worked there for several years showed it to me. I doubt any of the present staff know of its existence--if it does still exist. Curiosities stimulated well and the story begins.

For those for whom this is the first exposure to Merediths John Lloyd Mysteries, follow the synopsis - John Lloyd Branson, reputed to be the best criminal defense attorney Texas. In his formal three-piece suits, cowboy boots, Phi Beta Kappa key, he is certainly the most eccentric. He is assisted by his legal clerk, Lydia Fairchild.  In a variation of the classic locked room mystery, Attorney John Lloyd Branson and his beautiful, trusted, but often impetuous legal assistant, Lydia Fairchild scare up ghosts from the past and rattle family skeletons as they try to discover who murdered the young museum curator. It's no Halloween trick when Brad Hemphill materializes in a locked museum at midnight, the main feature in a prehistoric display. Who among the museum staff would kill the harmless, mild-mannered young curator, and why? What deadly secret did Hemphill know that made him a target for murder?

A very strange murder that unravels into a story that maintains the readers attention to the last page. Meredith writes in the quality of the best of mystery writers. Once she seduces you into her novel she holds you captive. Strong work! Grady Harp, March 17",Sarah Jane  the sprit of the museum,1489276800,,

**~..~** An All Is Read Review **~~..~**
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

 Sometimes you come across a new author or a debut genre and you find the story lacking that grip that pulls you in, with Frozen Barriers thats not the case. We are introduced to Emily and Jeremy, two people who couldn't be more different in terms of how they grew up but, as fate is fickle with what she wants, they keep running into each other. Both have a passion for the ice and each other and its a great ride to be on to see how their relationship develops and how both Jeremy and Emily come to know who they really are inside and become confident to express their new found freedom to the world. No matter what the consequences.

Frozen Barriers has all the go to elements you look for in a good story; laughter, excitement, disappointment, love and of course a HEA. But don't worry I didn't just give away the ending, because getting there is where the story lies and Frozen Barriers is just the beginning.

Keep a lookout for book 2 in the Barrier Series, ""Hidden Barriers"" (dont worry Ill keep you in the loop...) Happy Reading  Enjoy!

ARC supplied by Netgalley.
The Billionaire's Club is a series new to me and although there's already one book out each are stand alone so it was no problem to read this not having read book one. The books share characters and this one is about one of the members, Luke Preston. Playboy Luke has been shot by a jealous lover, and the police have yet to capture him so his friends persuade him to lay low for a while and take a sex break. Unheard of for Luke but he agrees after some persuasion on their part. They've been friends along time and he knows they have his best interest at heart.
However only a short while into his break on a secluded Cancun resort he sees Peyton, and his attraction is immeadiate...and Peyton is there hoping for a fling to shake off some of the staidness her life has become.
I liked both characters, really felt for Peyton with her determination to let go and yet still she felt afraid of what she was doing. Once she took the plunge though she was a wildcat and it was great to feel her grown in confidence. Luke took a bit of time to warm to - he started as a typical arrogant, selfish manwhore - ""they all know the score so.."" is his feelings about his love them and leave them lifestyle. He doesn't care if the ladies end up broken hearted as he feels he's given fair warning. Well of course this time the boot is on the oter foot. The novel is quite short at just 112 pages so of necessity the action takes place over the first few days then a gap of a few weeks and another few days interaction. In a short novel such as this it works well rather than trying to cover too long a time span and lose the essence of the book.
Its hot and steamy, with smouldering sex scenes. The attraction between Luke and Peyton is instant on both sides and the sexual tension leaps of the page until she says ""yes"" - then its all action and non stop sex for the couple. Inevitably the stay comes to an end and they go their seaprate ways and thats when Luke discovers this time he's at the other end and what is he going to do about it?

Its a great fun romance with a HEA  - well written and edited and packed with emotion. The scenes are very realistic and I felt that the couple could easily be real, the settings and the action blended so easily.
I'm not really a novella fan, but I did enjoy this and for a quick easy read to make you feel good and brighten your mood this is just perfect. It doesn't have  great drama, no deep dark plots as its not got the length, and Red sensibility focusses on what will work best - a simple, emotive, erotic love story.
Priced at 1.98 for 112 pages it's at the upper end of my personal VFM scale but for those who love to re-read a short, steamy romance it's  better value of course. Horses for courses and all that....

Review and other goodness originally posted at Supa Gurl Books as part of the ""Shallow"" book tour!
[...]

I'm going to try to be as shallow as possible in my review of Shallow by Geogia Caites...

Beautiful Payton in her hot car bumps into, literally, Gorgeous Nick (dontcha love that hot pic of my version of Nick? It's on the blog, check it out!) and his racing Camero and Nick uses his ""Jedi sex tricks"" to wrap Payton around his little finger.  Following so far?  Well it's not that simple; but it IS that fun!

I was actually surprised to find that I liked Payton because I envisioned some ""Mean Girls Regina wanna be"" after seeing the cover and hearing the title `Shallow"".  However, Payton is one saucy chic and Nick is taken with her the moment she opens her mouth!  I LOVED them.  Nick is tough as nails and yet as soft as a teddy bear especially when it comes to Payton.  As a `love em and leave em' type of guy he finds himself in new territory when he meets Payton who is looking for a real relationship like her best friends, Jessie and Claire, have.

As Payton and Nick take baby steps into the relationship waters economic status, family secrets and Nicks own playboy past threatens to tear them apart.  Will they be able to navigate the rough seas or is this a relationship destined to sink?

Until Tucker the bad boy player that she has been warned about strikes her interest. Her coworkers tell her to stay clear and that she should run in the opposite directionbut they bond and in Tucker she finds comfort. Comfort as a friendor is it more?

Tucker and Harper begin sharing their past and come to find they both need the support of each other. The bond between them grows stronger and stronger.
Now sure there are those bumps along the way but the security they feel in one another always overcomes the dark moments they share.

Harper is forced to face her past head on and with the support of Tucker and her new found friends she stands up for not only herself but for her sister she lost years ago. And in the End.well you will just have to read to find out more about Sexy Tucker and his ability to cure her wounded heart among other things

But this is not one of those fantasy romances you'd think of when you hear ""model meets professional athlete"".  Instead, it's about who they are beneath the facade they wear to face the world and who they are in REAL life.  This book takes place in the boonies of New Zealand (not that NZ is the boonies - I mean the boonies in NZ) where they are stripped of their glamour and the world's expectations and they just...are.  And it's a beautiful and heartwarming story about two people who meet at a vulnerable time in their lives and how they become friends and fall in love.

Possible spoilers -  beware!

This was a 4.5 read for me, but I rounded up because I loved it anyway.  It's not a perfect read for me, but it was pretty close to it.  This was a well written, sweet, charming and funny read where I really liked both the H and h, there were no TSTL moments to suffer through and I loved the supporting cast. I'll talk about what I liked first,  then go into why it's not a perfect read for me.

What I loved:
* great H.  I loved him; super alpha and protective,  but vulnerable and tender at the same time.  He has a temper and says stupid things sometimes, but he's mature enough to know when he's being stupid and is able to eat crow.  He's awesome, but he's real.
* I really liked the h.  Even if she is an underwear model.  I have to admit I was a little unsure about that - but I really liked her and enjoyed watching her grow into herself.  She went from being biddable and compliant and a pleaser to developing her own personality; we see her becoming stronger and more confident in herself as the book progressed.
* the slow burn.  This is not insta love.  It was kind of insta dislike that morphed into mutual respect, understanding, like, friendship, then love.  This is the kind of progression that at the end of the story you know they'll stay together.
* the supporting cast is fantastic.  Grandpa Arthur had some of the best lines in the book, both laugh out loud ones and wise and profound ones that gave me the feels.
* the book isn't just a story about Iain and Nina meeting and falling in love - it also explores love between spouses and how it evolves over the course of a long marriage.  One of the threads in the book is about Iain's parents - it reminds us that the wedding with the big poofy gown and shiny ring isn't the end of the story.  The other is a poignant look at what love looks like after a lifetime together and what happens when one of the two pass away.  Oh, the feels!  There's not a lot of mushy scenes, but Rosalind's words are so effective at constructing small moments which reveal so much that my heart felt mushy anyway.
* it's funny.  The banter between the characters is fantastic and there are some laugh out loud moments.  It's not a madcap rom com, but among all the feels and sweetness, there's a lot of smiling happening.

So...the not so good.  Honestly, it's one thing.  The bad guy.  The ex-fiance who wouldn't take no for an answer that Nina is running away from.  I get why he's in the story, but I thought he came off as a caricature of a villain.  He seemed very one dimensional and kind of crazy - like the cartoon villain that rubs his hands together and says, ""I'll get you my pretty"" and has an anvil that falls on his head at the end.  We'd have these lovely scenes in New Zealand and the story is flowing and everything is coming together then bam!  All of a sudden we'd get these random ""I'm an evil guy and no one gets away from me"" scenes that would pop up to remind us he's still there and he's a bad guy.  It was just jarring and weird.  Also, it made me a little anxious throughout the entire book waiting for the other shoe to drop - there's not a lot of character development and all I knew was that there was a ""bad guy"" out there, but I had no clue how he'd impact the story and Nina's new life, so I read this lovely beautiful story with bated breath wondering when the bad stuff was going to happen.

*** spoiler about bad guy ***

for those who care and get all anxious like I do - because I have a very low angst threshold: yes, he does show up and he tries to hurt her - but honestly, it's such a small part of the story (and resolved very quickly) that I felt kind of stupid to have let his presence mar my enjoyment of the rest of the book.  Truly, the story focuses on her growth as a person and her developing relationship with Iain - despite all the foreshadowing, Matthias (the bad guy) actually has a very small role in the book and doesn't affect the outcome a whole lot.

***end spoiler about bad guy ***

Even with the villain situation, I really enjoyed this book.  I always enjoy Rosalind's writing, but I loved the story and characters and their interactions.

This is the fifth and final book in the series but it did introduce several characters we will see in the spin off series.  This one can easily be read standalone.  The entire series, and this book is no exception, has great writing and characters as well as the exciting behind the scenes casino action that make it a fantastic read

In New Blue Hayden Tate is working hard in the male dominated Blue Casino and the one person she despises most just got a fantastic promotion.  Of course she's not at all surprised since she's sure his daddy had something to do with it.  She just has to hope he won't get in her way while she tries to dig up dirt on the casino's higher ups.  Proof of corruption is the only way to take these guys down.

Adam Cade doesn't understand why Hayden seems to hate him so much but pushing her buttons is about the most fun he's had in a long time.  After finally breaking away from his father, he feels like he is finally making his own way.  Letting Hayden derail his efforts just isn't an option.  Things just don't seem to be the way they should be at the casino though and that has him proceeding cautiously.  Add to that the fact that his attraction to Hayden will not die down and he is utterly frustrated!

You definitely will enjoy Hayden and Adam's story.  I highly recommend it.",Fantastic,1459209600,,

Something about Giammatteo's writing always clicks with me and I long ago fell in love with Nicky Fusco and Frankie Donovan.

Nicky is something like Leon, from The Professional, in the sense that he is stone cold and somehow soft at the same time. It's a heady mix. Frankie is the classic good cop who struggles with doing the right thing while honoring his older loyalties at the same time.

But there are so many layers and so much enmeshment between the two men that nothing can ever be straightforward again. Frankie's ability to remain a clean cop often comes at the expense of Nicky's willing ness to get his soul dirty. Thus, there is so much guilt and love and sacrifice and giving that goes on between these two men that the reader just melts.

I would say that Call of the Vampire is one of those books that are hidden gems. Why do I say this? Well, because it's one of those books that you find by accident, or has been recommended to you by a friend, that you have never heard of before, but turns out to be a great read. This book may be a paranormal romance about vampires but it didn't feel heavy, not on the paranormal side or on the romance side; it was a very light and fun read, with just the right amount of romance and suspense. Nothing overdone and that's what I liked about it. The writing in it was very easy to get into. Very fluid.

What really caught my attention in this book was the plot-line of having a vampire running into a human who looked like his past love at a ball. It's like a Disney movie, but with vamps and just a tad more darker. And I can't help it. I just love storylines like that. Remind me of the show 'The Vampire Diaries' where the main character Stefan, a vampire, is attracted to Elena - a human girl who looks just like his huge epic love back in the 1800s. We have a similar vibe in this book in the sense that we quite don't know why both people resemble each other so much or why one of them reminds the vampire of the other person he knew originally. And basically, the story revolves around the unraveling of that mystery.

The main characters in this novel were incredible. The story is told from Aurora's point of view. She is feisty, loyal, and intelligent. Her reactions to finding out about a hidden supernatural world were pretty realistic. It's not like this girl was totally comfortable and amazed at liking a vampire. She constantly scolded herself mentally and reacted like most people would by thinking: Am I crazy for liking a vampire? Yes, I might be. Her thoughts on things were really honest with just the right touch of sarcasm. Jessie Vanderlind on the other hand, our resident vampire, who is of course, gorgeous - Yup. No Dracula looking vamps please - had an incredible sophistication to him, due to the fact that he's lived for, like, a hundred years. And though he was really strong and fierce in his actions, this vampire had a sensibility to him, an innocence, a loneliness, and a longing that were quite touching. In that sense, his soul was very youthful. I kinda had the feeling that despite having lived for decades that he was still trying to understand life and love, just like any young person who feels lost.

The secondary characters in this novel were also amazing. We had Blossom who is Aurora's best friend and who on the outside might be seen as the typical cheer leader, even mean girl type of person, but who in reality, was a pretty good friend, pretty smart, and feisty herself. Aurora's mother was an amazing character. A therapist who helps young troubled girls. She was so present in the life of Aurora - a rarity in Young Adult novels who sometimes tend to forget that characters indeed do have families. There was also Aurora's great grandmother who was crucial to understanding the mystery between Aurora looking just like Jessie Vanderlinds first love. I also loved Viggo, a large man with a Russian accent who works in the Vanderlind castle who kinda reminded me of Lurch from the Addams Family movies.

My favorite part of this novel had to be all the confrontations that Aurora had with villains or creepers. Because Aurora has a mother who is a therapist who helps counsel troubled young women, her mother's advice on how to deceive or tackle an encounter with a creeper are always on the forefront of her mind. And when indeed Aurora had to fight or verbally scold one of the villains in the story, she was so smart about it and very fierce. She wasn't the damsel in distress type. She would either confront the person who was harrasing her or find a clever way to avoid them or deceive them and she also was protective of her friend Blossom and her safety. She would deconstruct every move her opponent made and really I just thought all her tips were amazing to read because there are, well, always creepy peeps out there. Us gals always have to be on the lookout. And, well, anyone for that matter. So the safety tips in this book were a surprise but a very welcome one. I just really thought it was a clever addition to this story.

Last but not least, we do have an incredibly evil villain named Viktor who could pass off as Voldemort's younger brother. This guy was just awful and pure malice. So predatorial in his actions.

This book definitely ends on a note of mystery. Things are not completely resolved and there is still a lot of things gone unclear in Jessie and Aurora's relationship, so, I kinda need that sequel - pronto.

This book is awesome! I love how the author describes the scenery as well as the characters in this book.

Not to mention Kylie makes you wish that you met her in real life, she's hilarious. I advise anyone who is going to read this book to beware of your surroundings, because this book will have you laughing out loud. It will also have you making faces while reading, which never happen before until now. If you're like me and have some questions at the end, well don't worry because the author will reveal them in book 2 and book 3 of the series.

I loved all the characters, both the H and h as well as the side characters. The hockey guys were a riot and kept me laughing. I loved Duncan. What a sweet, sexy, down to earth guy. There was great chemistry between Duncan and Amber and the sex was nice and steamy just like I like it.

Although this is part of a series it can be read as a stand alone. I never felt lost in the story or that I was missing something. I do think I would have had a better insight into Duncan's character had I read book 1 though. The h in that one was Duncan's sister so I imagine he would have a big role in it.

I think the only thing that kept me from a five star rating would be the unessesary ""tragedy"" going on with another teammate. I saw no benefit to this being added to the book. I read to escape and hate it when something like this is thrown in to depress me. Hate it.

But there is one man that is in the center, Hunter. She has had a crush on him since he came to her rescue on the side of the road when she was just sixteen. But a man like Hunter in't one you dream of taming, he may star in a few fantasies; but he is always just out of reach.

When she finds herself in disparate need of money there is only one place to go, only one thing left to sell. Her virginity. Love Incorporated is a well established brothel ran by Marchant, Hunter's best friend. A place Hunter knows all too well. But she's not just stepping into his arena when she finds herself in Vegas preparing to be auctioned off to the highest bidder; she has walked right into his nightmare.

Hunter's life gets turned upside down when he wakes to find his bed empty. Suddenly he is being blackmailed and is trapped in a web of crimes that he can't seem to escape. His life is complicated and when he can't stop thinking of Libby, complicated is just the beginning. He remembers her at sixteen and he can't seem to forget about her now. But keeping her safe means keeping her out of reach. The only problem is, he can't seem to say no.

""One time I fell in love with a woman in a Porsche.""

This was such a well written and complex story and I loved every second of it. As the story starts off you get both points of views and pretty much two stories playing out. They intersect a few times at the start but really don't blend together until Libby makes her way to Vegas to prepare for the auction. Both parts of this story was captivating and Hunter was one of those bad-boy Heroes that is completely broken. He can't sleep, he can't be intimate; spending his time in the bed of the escorts at the ranch; former addict and man that's keeping secrets... I love this combination like a fat kid loves cake!

Libby was sure enough of herself, she didn't have an easy road and she was a tad bit shy at times; but all that faded whenever she found herself near Hunter. She was inexperienced, but her body knew how to react to him - it always had. And although there are some unsavory things about him, she just is unable to refuse that she wants him. I loved that she was willing to risk emotions for just simple tastes of him, rather than push and push until he gave her want she wanted; she was willing to take each experience with him as a gift. No self-shaming afterwards, just a little sullen taste of reality.

""...he screams sex. The kind of sex that's all slick skin and pheromones, bulging biceps...""

But that doesn't last too long. This had a feel of insta-love, but since they shared a history that went far beyond the start of this story, it played out perfectly with the timeline of events.

Beyond the romance and the sexy hero we got one h*lluva suspense vibe from the story. I was hooked into the who-dunnit aspects of this story just as I was with the relationship forming between Hunter & Libby. Cross is the next feature character to get his book, Taming Cross. I am excited to start this one since we got so much from the portions he was in during this book. Although he was not in a lot of the scenes, he was a major player in this story and we got enough of a tease into his back story to pull us right into his story.

Overall this was a fantastic read, Ella James does a beautiful job with the mingling of romance and suspense while ensuring that neither overtook the other as the story played out. Thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series and am excited for Cross & March's story, hopefully we'll get a few bits and pieces of Hunter and Libby as the series continues.",What a fantastic read!,1406332800,,

It took me on a journey that I still can't get out of my head. It is filled with darkness, passion, thrilling suspense and some horrific scenes that were cringe worthy and made me cry for Tess.
But it was also filled with so much love, desire and lust of a beautiful unconventional love story between Tess and Q and what they go through to be together.
Tess is fierce and strong and living an ordinary, boring life. Shes in a relationship which is doing nothing for her, but her boyfriend doesnt understand what she wants or needs.
Q Mercer is French, gorgeous, wealthy, well known, broken and really screwed up and he believes he is one sordid monster that he is struggling to live with. He is fighting his desires on a daily basis until he meets Tess and everything changes for him.
The circumstances that bring Tess and Q together are extraordinary. I couldn't believe the twists in this story. Will Tess find what she has always wanted in life through the tragedy she goes through? Will Q find what he is looking for or needs in Tess?

I read this as a stand alone without reading Pucked first, without issue., but I am kicking myself for not starting this series earlier.

I laughed out loud more times than I care to mention. The cringe worthy situations Miller kept getting himself into. Pucked Up is hilarious, but it's also sweet and touching. Miller ""Buck"" Butterson is a player, a manwhore. The media has played him as such. He has more selfies taken with ""bunnies"" than a lot of the other hockey players. The only issue is he's given it all up for Sunny. He's trying to stay faithful but getting caught on camera in compromising positions doesn't look good for him. Her brother Alex is on his team and engaged to his step-sister, he doesn't think Miller is good enough for Sunny. Sunny is tired of putting up with Miller's behavior. Can they make a relationship work, especially one that is long distance? Can he show her that being in a relationship is what he wants?

This is my first read by Ms. Hunting and I can assure you it won't be my last. Her writing draws you in, you get so invested in the characters. Once you are drawn in add the humor, the feels and it's a great story. I can't wait to see what happens in Pucked Over. and you can bet I will be going back to read Pucked now that I know what a fantastic series this is.

However, I finally got the time to really sit down and get everything out that makes this series so brilliant.

I won't post any synopsis this time, because let's be honest, I'm reviewing all three books, so it's hard to put a synopsis down. Let's just say for the sake of it, it's the beautiful love story of Robert and Brooke.

I will admit that I didn't fall in love with the books right away. The love took a little more time to take root, but once it did, it completely blossomed. For me mostly it was the writing style of Tracie that took some getting used to, but also I wasn't really sure where the first book was going, so this made me a little unsure of the whole story.

BUT, the more I read, the longer I was on this journey, the more attached I grew to the characters and in the end, was bawling my eyes out at quite a few times during the last book. Plus. that last sentece in book three just...wow...I mean....that was the moment where I really was crying like a baby. It was THAT perfect.

But first things first: Brooke has left England after a break-up and is visiting her best friend. It is at his work place where she meets Robert, and despite him intimidating the hell out of her, there is something about him that doesn't allow Brooke to let him go again. They embark on a journey that none of the two is expecting. There is lots of trial and error, lots of misunderstandings and yet they always manage to find their way back together. Brooke comes to realize that sometimes there are things in life that you shouldn't take for granted, and others that you have to work hard for. Robert is both of those. Slowly throughout the story so finds a way to make him see what a great person he is, despite everything that he believes about himself. And sometimes that's not pretty.

Robert is such a unpredictable character. Like I said in the beginning, I had no idea where this book was gonna go, if he was gonna end up being and actual fallen angel (I mean, come on, it's the title after all), if he's in the mafia (I read the Eagle Elite series before that, that might have rubbed up a little) or what was going on with him. And the more layers Brooke started to peel off, the more in love with him I feel. But also with their love for each other. Yes, it might be sudden and head over heels, but you can tell quickly that this is no fling, that none of the two actually want this to be a summertime love, but the real thing.

The story got better with every page. You could tell that Tracie also progressed as a writer and storyteller, and I loved seeing that. I loved being part of this amazing story, because besides Robert and Brooke, I also fell in love with all the side characters. They are a beautiful addition to the main story and make this so much more enjoyable.

Especially in the last book, my emotions were all over the place. The last part is such a heartfelt and heartbreaking one that I just had to blink away tears more than usually. It made me hope and beg Tracie to finish this story in a way where I don't have to go and rock in the corner! And like I said, the last sentence brought me to my knees, simply because of how beautifully perfect it was.

So, while it took me a little bit to get into this story, it is a beautiful story of finding love, finding things that it's worth sacrificing yourself for, and finding that one person that makes your life complete.

THANK YOU, Tracie Podger, for this story, for bringing those characters to life and for making me fall in love with them!!! I don't regret any single step I took on the way!!!

I don't know if this author has written anything before or if she's ever been in a serious relationship because both the writing and the love was very teenagerish.

I wanted so badly to like this book but I could barely finish it. Killian's dirty talk was terrible and unrealistic, there was little 'meat' to any of the characters, their relationship/insta-love/dirty talk was totally forced and awkward and the blackmail and anal sex scenes?

I have found that she has the ability to write many different types of books in the romance genre, and I have yet to find one that I didn't love.

Mr. Wright Now is no different.

One of the things that I have found the I love the most about her writing, is how I find myself feeling like I can connect with the main characters. In this story I feel like I can relate to Neleana in the way that she had never really let herself let loose and just have fun for the sake of fun. I've always found I've had a hard time with this as well.

After Neleana left her douche-bag of a fiance at the alter right before finding out her had slept with her sister, her best friend, Kali, and her father both talk her into going to Vegas for a two week vacation to try and get past the breakup and maybe have a little bit of fun.
Neleana isn't looking for much, a little bit of sun and relaxation, and maybe a guy, a Mr. Right now, to get her mind off of her troubles.
What she didn't expect was to literally meet Mr. Wright, Kade Wright that is, on her first night in town. Or to fall for his charms and go home to spend the night with him.

But after they both realize that one night together isn't going to be enough, they decide to commit to each other for the two weeks she'll be in town, and then go their separate ways.

Because that always sounds like a good idea right? There's no possible way, after the heartbreak they've both experienced, that anything about that plan will blow up in their faces...

But that's why we love books like this, because even though we've all read similar stories, each time they are told in a new and exciting way, and Alannah Carbonneau is no different in the regard.
Her stories are never old and predictable. She finds a new way to write each character that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next page.

His dad, Easy, was president of the Brothers of Mayhem before he was sent to prison for killing Storms mom which placed Storm in the presidency spot as soon as he got out of prison for keeping his mouth shut revolving around Brothers business. Once Storm took over the presidency he tried to get some money for the club by providing protection services for anyone who had money to pay for their expertise. So when Mary Jane was being threatened she turned to the Brothers for their special services. Little did she know that she would get more services than she first had thought in the form of dark and sexy Brothers of Mayhem President, Storm Ryder.

Mary Jane had grown up in a commune and was now a business woman who ran multiple motorcycle repair shops with an old family friend, Jimmy. Mary Jane was very close to Jimmy and thought of him as her surrogate grandfather. Mary Jane and Jimmy had to pay money to a gang named the Thirty-seconds and after they missed some payments Jimmy had paid with his life so that led Mary Jane to Storm for his protection. The chemistry between Storm and Mary Jane was pretty intense and neither of them fought off the attraction for very long and ended up meaning more to the other one than was good for them. Storm had his hands full trying to keep the Brothers unified especially once Easy got out of prison and made it his goal to take out the son who he hated.

I don't think Ive ever had a person who I despised more than Easy Ryder for everything that he had done in his life. Youll have to read to see to what extent Easy was depraved by everything he did to Storm. Mary Jane came from a free living commune so how was she ever going to make it in the biker world if she did decide to take a leap of faith with Storm or for that matter did Storm want to pull Mary Jane in to his world? Mary Jane was one hell of a strong woman and to see how she dealt with Storms past trauma gave you a really good feeling.

They usually produce a very good account of the subject, with a good selection of sources and some photos, images or maps.

I have read  negative reviews on some of their books, mostly claiming inaccuracies which seemed to me as minor. If you read a book on a subject on which you are no expert, you can produce no such detailed review, and their books cover a very wide range. However, having read at least one of their books on a subject I had read a lot about before, and being very satisfied with that one, I took this as a standard.

Their books are not to be expected as complete, comprehensive works, but lean more toward a good overall short account. Choose one if the subject is new to you or you want a good overview. They appeal to me as good introductions, or if I have no intention of reading long works on a specific theme. That said, I like them and think they're very effective in providing good information as well as a good read.

Such is the case here on the Battle of Verdun.

While on honeymoon Lucy already gets a taste of how things will be different, now that she is his wife, when she is punished outside in full view of another bungalow neighbor. Lucy is mortified, but Max is indifferent. He will punish her for her transgressions whenever it is needed. Regardless of who is around or where they are. Max also really pushes Lucy to be exceptionally open about her role in their marriage to the myriad of people they come in contact with while they are on honeymoon. Although Lucy does feel a little anxiety and trepidation at having to be so open about her relationship, she also finds it enlightening and freeing to be able to be who she wants without rebuke.
When they return home, Lucy is no longer working, according to Maxs rules, and Max is also very keen on getting pregnant ASAP. He just wants his own happy family with the house, wife, and kids. Lucy is struggling with her new role and is also scared that she won't be able to get pregnant. Being that is one of Maxs requirements she fears that something will happen that will make it so she cant fulfill this wish. She is also fearing how their child will be raised, and how their child will view her given the kind of relationship she has with Max. But throughout all her fears and insecurities, Lucy tries as hard has ever to be the wife that she wants and needs to be for Max.

One of my favorite things in this story is Lucy sticking up for herself to her friend Tracy. Who has been trying to ruin Lucys relationship from the get go because she doesnt like how Max treats Lucy. This is funny on its own as Tracy is so freaking demanding and disrespectful to everyone in her circle. She completely disregards her friends opinions and feelings. So it was with much applause that I read Lucy finally giving an earful to Tracy. Which consisted of the things stated above, and her telling Tracy to basically shove it because she doesnt have to listen to what she says and won't anymore. Of course Im sure a lot of readers couldn't understand this given that she obeys Max and does everything he says. But she agreed to that kind of lifestyle and relationship with Max. What Tracy did was essentially bullying. Doing whatever she needed to in order to make everyone around her fall to her feet and do everything she says. I LOVED having Lucy finally give it to her.

On the other side of the spectrum we have Laura, who I adored. She is so sweet and caring and just wants her friends to be happy. She is definitely a people pleaser who hasn't realized her submissive nature yet. She really is a good friend as she listens to Lucy and gives her opinion when asked. She doesnt judge Lucy, in fact just asks questions so that she can better understand her friend. GREAT friend!! Everyone should have one of these.

The end of the book is a giant cliffy. Lucys phone and purse are in the garbage can outside the Dr. office she was supposed to have an appointment with. What happened? You will need to read 4.1 and/or 4.2 to find out as there are two different endings to this story. I, personally, preferred 4.1 instead of 4.2, but youll have to decide for yourself.

Rosado,"Ava is a feisty woman, set on starting over in a new town near her cousin, and opening a lingerie store with an adult toy shop in the back. Seth is the small town sheriff entrusted by the townsfolk to keep them safe. The two cross paths and the sparks fly, until Seth starts gossiping about some `crazy person trying to open an adult store' in his town. When Seth learns that it's Ava, he tries to convince her that her store isn't wanted and maybe it'd be better for her to leave. Ava's not one to let a man push her around, though her past seems to say differently. After her store is targeted by vandals and Seth's words are painted on the wood used to board up the previous assault on her store, Ava is convinced that something not quite so wholesome is going on in her new town.  Still, try as she may, she can't keep her hands off Seth, and Seth off her.  It looks to be that perhaps there is more to Seth then just his desire to keep her store out of her town.

The story is quick paced and easy to read. We follow Ava as she tries to find her allies in a small town that might just not be open to her store, especially on the main drag that the citizens use to go drive to church and funerals. Ava's determined to not let a few incidents keep her from opening up, and she forges on. The heat between her and Seth is apparent and everyone can see that they're crazy for each other.  With Seth's help, they're determined to get down to the bottom of things before they escalate too much further.

Personally, I called the culprit early on and am surprised that Ava herself didn't seem to catch it. I don't want to include too many details of the story, but I do want to say that I'm disappointed that the main character was so certain who it wasn't that she didn't see the clues. The author, I'm sure, wrote them in there as a `hindsight is 20/20 sort of thing.  While I do think a certain relationship or two did progress fairly quickly, I can't hold that against the characters. They were in a hurry to find their sweet spots.

Well written and researched historical novellas  with charming characters who find love in the end. I really enjoyed this collection and each story warmed my heart, encouraged me with scripture, and reminded me of the power of love; both human and God's!

My Candy Valentine
Gilbert Williams sweeps Catrina Jensen off her feet in this sweet romantic story! Impressed with her candy shop display, he's on a mission to bring a new business venture to his boss Harold Marchbanks. Not realizing they've had very bad dealings with him before, when the truth is revealed can Gilbert make it right with God's help ? And will he win Catrina's heart?

Love's Glory:
(Note):
I love that the author chose our hero's name based on her son's name Jaran. She's a very proud mom to be blessed with such a faithful young man who follows the Lord with all his heart!

Garan Schmidt, long thought killed in WW2, returns from the dead! Beth aka Elsbeth, meets her brother Alfred at the airstrip after the war & is taken by surprise when she see's Garan. Past mistakes made them both parents to a little girl named Dottie. He has no idea he was a father and is quick to make it right by a hasty marriage. Can these two find forgiveness & love at last? And with God's help, can the lies Beth has told be made right again?

(Favorite book quotes):
No matter how rocky the start, the banner of their marriage was lovehis love, and God's.

Grace and truth, love's glory flew over Garan and Elsbeth's family in a banner designed by God Himself

Tobogganing for Two:
When Laura & Eliza Evans move to Plymouth, Nebraska to live with their aunt and seek the help of Dr. Jay Andrews, they got more than they bargained for!

Laura feels responsible for what happened to her sister, sequestering her life to help care for her. Will she allow the Lord to heal both her spirit & heart?

Favorite book quote from this one that I think perfectly sums it up:
Maybe, just maybe, God had brought them together to help them heal.

Christmas Visitors:
This is a strong reminder of the Christmas story in the Bible where three kings visited the young Jesus bearing gifts. Cora, Alex & young Joshs lives intertwined years before when tragedy hit both of them in devastating ways. Cora uses her house as a B&B taking in boarders and watches young Josh for Alex during the day.  One day, three visitors come to stay; they bring a message of his mothers passing and bear gifts from her.  God touches and changes hearts through the letters she wrote; bringing with them forgiveness, extending peace and a second chance at love. The last gift Alexs mom gave was the sweetest one! It made me smile and dream of their future together.

Angel in Disguise:
Rosie an angel in disguise, though her methods need a lot of work! A new convert to Christianity, she absorbs all she can from the church on the teachings of Christ.ever curious and eager to learn! She literally takes the teaching of taking care of the poor and providing for the orphans to heart.

Even if he doesn't want to admit it, Daron is gay; in less than a year, he will have three different partners, all of them men, plus a not so hidden interest in a fourth one. It's only that we are in 1986 and being gay is still a stigma, especially in the music rock world Daron is trying to enter. Another point that is important to highlight is that this is the 1986, just one years before AIDS became the plague we all know. And unfortunately, Daron is only worried about being gay for what it means to his career, not to his life: Daron is having unprotected sex with many partners, something that will become very dangerous very soon and very dramatically.

Something that is probably important to say is that this is not an erotic romance; Daron is having sex, but most of the time the reader is not invited inside the bedroom, we only know that something happened.

Issues with the maintenance in her apartment, then she's mugged but luckily some guy comes by and rescues her and makes the muggers give back her wallet. Then her boss who has not only demoted her from lawyer to paralegal but treated her like crap for years makes her serve a scumbag with court papers which is how she gets stuck inside a chimney to when she's rescued yet again by the knight in shining armor. Whom she tells she has a boyfriend. After going back to work to change, she finds her boyfriend with his pants down with her boss, to end the night she goes home to find her apartment building on fire.

Ignoring the two young women that are flirting with him he follows her out the door. When he finally catches her scent, she's being mugged. He immobilizes them and makes them return her wallet. He's used to watching women fall all over themselves to get his attention, but this gal doesn't; which baffles him. While at a party with his brother, Trent catches her scent again. He finds her stuck inside the chimney, after he rescues her again she tells him she has a boyfriend but he can tell there hasn't been another male scent  on her for quite some time.

The first book, ""The Thirteenth Child"" was a solid urban fantasy with some romantic elements. This book has a strong romance as a subplot to the mystery. The mystery is very well-developed, with some great surprises. But readers should know that this installment has many more graphic sex scenes, and erotic undertones than the first book. That made it all the better for me.

Cole is a very likeable hero, that reminds me a lot of Harry Dresden. He's more roguish than noble, but he is a ""paranormal"" being (Sidhe rather than wizard) living in a world that doesn't believe in magic. He also works with a special police squad, Section Thirteen, tasked with supernatural cases. At the end of book one, Cole was roped into the Section as a Special Detective and also began a relationship with the team leader, Joss Vallimun. I love their romance - it has a strong foundation, hot sex and both men are realists trying their best in an insane world. However, the mystery is what had me reading this book straight through in one evening. Someone is killing little boys by burning them alive. In the midst of that case, Cole and Joss get pulled into another. A murdered teacher at a private school, where fey are being enslaved. It seems most urban fantasies have a human organization that hates the ""otherworldy"" and this one is no different. Cole has avoided them, until now. I loved that the story had multiple plot lines, with lots of twists and more than one ""villain."" There is a lot fo character development, and unexpected consequences for Cole and Joss.

Overall, this was another fantastic novel, and I cannot wait for more. My one teensy, tiny criticism? I hate the cover. The first one was excellent. It evoked a paranormal urban fantasy, but hinted at a romance with Cole's bare chest. This looks like any other contemporary gay romance.

I didn't find myself as connected to this month.  I missed her ""Client adventures"" and although I believe everything that happened during September is gearing us up for the series to come to an end, it lacked something and I don't want to say it was her ""clients"" because I know that along the way during this series Mia has done more than just make money.  She has made long lasting friends who have become her family.  She has not only found herself during this journey, but she has helped many clients along the way find their happiness.  I just really found this month to be one of my least favorites.  Yes Mia had some not so great things happen this month.  Which was the main focus of the story line.  We had her dad - who is still in the hospital.  We have her ex- causing havoc in her life.  We have Wes - sweet Wes!  I've been Team Wes from the beginning!  His circumstances this month had you stop for a moment and say ""Audrey.... Don't You Dare Do This""!  We have Mia still coming to terms that she now has a brother Max.  I am too.  I am still not sure what I think about this whole Max situation.  I want to love him.  I just don't yet.  Her life has changed dramatically over the months of August and September.  This month had a totally different vibe for me from all the others prior.  I am curious as to how this is going to wrap up.  With only a few months left for her year to be up.  No tissues were needed by me.  I did find my emotions a tad bit higher when it came to the news of Wes.  Overall, I felt this month was not as exciting as the months before.  It was slow and depressing.  Which I know is what she was trying to do.  Every situation going on this time around was on the not so happy times scale and so she gave us just that.  I personally just missed everything we have come to love about Mia's journey.  (Just my opinion. Don't throw stones people).  I know Mia had to have some kind of break down eventually.  And this month was kinda that.  It showed that Mia can not always have the happy face on and can't always be the strong one.  She too, has moments of weakness and moments that she needs to just lay down and cry!  I get it.  Aside from Wes and his news.  I just felt the storyline of the other two issues kind of led us up to something BIG that was going to happen and then .......whomp whomp whomp........nothing.  Everything was good!

From the very beginning this book grabbed my attention with the image of a young boy in a confessional booth, covered in bruises and clutching bloody rosary beads. Some ten years later we catch up with him again on his journey to seek redemption from a girl called Wren. To give more of the story away would be unfair as this book should be entered into blindly to get the full effect. If youve ever wanted a glimpse into the deranged mind of a serial killer, this book will certainly allow you that- and then some.
Mary E. Palmerin has given us a work so gruesome and unapologetic that I was held in fascination of the horror like a person looking at a car wreck and counting all the bodies. This book is not romanticized, the author doesnt even try  but I was so infatuated by the writing style and the darkness of the characters that I never saw a single plot twist coming. And there were many.
The writing style was surreal. Told mainly for Rhys POV, his untethered mind only alludes to the events that led him to become what he is today. There were instances of intense and graphic detail and other moments where time seemed to speed up and if you weren't paying attention, events would pass you by. We also get glimpses from other characters POV and memories from some. It all left me feeling unbalanced but I loved the entire journey.
This book is dark. This book it twisted. This book is graphic. If you're expecting romance, you are not going to get it here, but it is a brilliantly written and refreshing story and for those who want to wander along the more disturbing paths of literature, this book comes highly recommended.
SAFETY GANG WARNING:

If you are offended by unfavorable views about religion - DO NOT read this book. All things above are explained in graphic detail.

Isabel and Robert knew each other as young adolescents, but Robert's family moved away and they lost touch. However, 16 years later, she's in grad school and he's in medical school on the same university campus when they see each other again. Over a series of dates they reconnect as friends and develop affections for each other. However, Isabel and especially her father, think that Robert is hiding something - something important. Can she trust him? Does he honestly love her? She wants to think he loves her, but why does he always hold back?

Robert seems like every girl's dream in a man, but he's got a past that he's desperately trying to fix so that he can move forward with Isabel. When that past is revealed, my heart broke for him. He had been through so much. Will Isabel forgive him for not being fully honest about his past? Will her father accept him?

In Dietmar Wehr's series there are some twists that occur that take this space opera in an entirely different direction.
In this final book mankind is divided into the Federation which has defeated the rebels, and a new foe has arisen the Empire. The Empire is overthrowing the Federation on the advice of a supercomputer in order to save humanity from falling into anarchy. There is a joker in this deck. The computer has an agenda of its own and begins to takeover and enslave humanity and plans on exterminating a large part of mankind. There is a group of rebels that is fighting back and Rumors of Salvation is the story of that struggle.

This book has been in my kindle waiting for me to read it. However, I kept putting it off. I know, it's a shame. Especially, when I really love the authors that went in it together. The four authors that were part of this anthology are Ava Stone, Catherine Gayle, Jane Charles, and Jerrica Knight-Catania. I have read books from each of these authors and love their writing.

Now about the book: What would the season be like without the famous betting book at Whites? I bet pretty dull, so we have four stories writing by four authors. In this collaboration we have four friends Lady Philippa Casemore, Lady Georgianna Bexley-Smythe, Lady Moria Kirtwood, and Miss Patience Findley who are making there coming out together. Somehow each of them ended up in the infamous betting book at Whites. How are they ever going to make a decent match with that much notoriety?

The first story is by Ava Stone called, ""By Any Other Name."" We have Lady Philippa  Casemore (also called Pippa) who is trying to avoid the devilish handsome Earl Of St. Austell, Jason York. However, she can't remember what he looks like. Which could be a problem within itself. Jason uses his lesser title to get close to Pippa, which it makes oh so much fun.

The second story is by Catherine Gayle called, ""Flight of Fancy."" Lady Georgianna Bexley-Smythe (also called Georgie) who has her heart set on adventure. However, her brother's friend Cedric Loring, the Earl of Montague had been asked to keep an eye on the family has a hard time keeping track of Georgie. Especially, when his stodginess is trying keep her out of the clutches of Lord Haworth.

The third story is by Jane Charles called, ""Landing a Laird."" Lady Moira Kirtwood would anything to get away from her mother. I don't blame her on that count. She is willing to marry a Scottish Laird and live in Scotland to get away from her mother. Gideon Baxter, Viscount Ainsley is out looking for a bride, but no one is to know this (shush). Gideon gets to know Moira and comes to really like her, but can't understand why she would want to live in Scotland. With all the stuff that happens to Moira, I would probably would have ran away and head to the continent or the Americas. Scotland would not be far enough away with a mother like hers.

The final story is by Jerrica Knight-Catania called ""The Marriage Trap."" Miss Patience Findley is trying to get past her father's scandalous actions and was fearful that she wouldn't land a husband. So, she enlist her cousin to make a scandalous bet in the book. Rowan Findley decides his friend Tristan Wafford, Baron Swaffham would work. The bet is made and Tristan on prowl to win his bet. Funny how rakes find out they actually have a heart after all.

All the stories were fun and entertaining.

But is it all about time management? No, as the author points out, it is also about our deep desires to bring up our children in ways that they will have a healthy self-esteem, work ethic, respect for themselves and others. Without parents having enough time to be consistently involved with their kids, those qualities are harder to develop.

The author offers a list of activities to do with our family--IF we have the time. Of course, we got to get rid of that IF. Some activities are cooking and shopping for groceries. Get the kids involved in understanding what makes a home run smoothly and happily. Do things like walking, hiking, games (not computer!)

There are some unrealistic expectations in the author's advice, such as found in the chapter ""Every Second Matters."" The advice that you should spend as much time as you can with your kids neglects the parent's need for some alone time or time just with her/his spouse. Parents who deeply love and respect each other make the best role models and support team for their kids.

While a lot happens which is historically important, not so much for the captain and crew of the Rocinante. This is the 5th novel in the series and they can't be all that bad, since I've read them all, and I will read the next one when it comes out in November 2016. I think this one was better than the last, which I gave 3 stars, but it definitely has some significant flaws. One thing I think has improved is the style is less obviously of two different authors - the last book Cibola Burn read like two novelas cut & pasted together. This one still has different voices, but much better. I also liked that none of the characters (except Holden, see below) does something implausibly stupid (like acting captain Naiomi abandoning her ship to jet around in space). Didn't happen here, that's good. OK. So here are the problems with the book. First: nothing happens. Each chapter follows one of the main characters and none of them really accomplish anything, except perhaps to get back to where they were at the start of the novel - with the exception of Naiomi who both suffers physically and grows emotionally (I guess she grows, the authors toss that in our face, but it requires acceptance that claim is true despite no evidence for it and that we must rewrite previous plots and dialog which show her to be emotionally strong and mature. Its quite a rewrite of the character's arc.) I don't like women as victims and I really don't like women as dumb victims. Naiomi is both here. She puts herself into a ridiculous and completely foreseeable situation, and her story line is about how she gets herself (quite implausibly) out of it. At the end, except for wear and tear, she's accomplished nothing except spend half of her savings. Holden accomplishes even less. Worse, he shows himself to be completely incompetent with program code. Not only personally, but as the one ultimately responsible for the operation of said code (although is computer/electronic code really that important on a spacecraft? All it controls is life support, fusion drive, navigation, weapons, and communication, after all). Alex ditto, although he brings back a stray dog. Amos, ah Amos! Well, forget him being a sociopath - turns out he is a sociopath with a heart of gold. ""The enemy of my friend is my friend"" seems to be his new motto. His story line is the most implausible. It rests on a ""just so"" moment - he miraculously is at the right place at the right time to avoid being a casualty and manages (naturally, its space opera!) to get out of the virtually impossible situation he finds himself along with rescuing damsel(s) in 'distress'. Most annoying is his disloyalty to Holden at the end of the book. Also annoying is the clumsy set-up for the next book: A carte blanche amnesty deal (apparently everyone else but Naiomi is a moron?) which is exactly what Amos needs, but how could Naiomi possibly have known that?, an evil tyrant, and some inexplicable lapses in war strategy by the bad guys (hint: since the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, it's no harder hitting a target on the Moon than on Earth, and it should have been an obvious target).

Most of the characters acted like five year old children most of the time.  Dialogue was described as ""shrieking"" or ""screaming"" in far too many instances.  I really hate characters who shriek at each other.  All of the women were just pathetic.  The only thoughts they had in their poor little heads revolved around finding new random sexual partners.

Much of the character interaction involved stupid arguments that could easily be addressed in a more rational manner.  The heroine was super annoying.  She was one of those characters who will run out into traffic just because somebody told her not to.  The love interest with whom she had a deep and indescribable connection was a complete tool.  Seriously, nobody with other options would have any interest in this creepy loser, but the heroine was putty in his hands.

Our hero Ript is lonely, having been rejected by most females because of his massive size, gruff voice and the scars marring his otherwise handsome face and body. He beleives he's destined to be alone, his King things otherwise and sends him back to earth in search of his mate.

He's sent to Alaska and eventually comes upon a woman Nina who is out to save the bears from Poachers, she's small in stature but strong in determination and he instantly drawn to her, when he saves her from being attacked he knows she's the one, he just doesn't know if she will accept him.

I enjoyed this story because the roles were reversed, the hero Riot while we know he's handsome and heroic doesn't believe that he will find the love of a woman because of his outward appearance... it takes a special women to show him that she loves him just the way he is.

Ryker, an awesome single father who's just looking to get through his divorce and make it day to day, finds love in the first woman Hockey General Manager, Grey Brannon. First, let's talk about Ryker being a single father. When there is a man who steps up and raises his children, and then does it by himself, I always have to acknowledge. This man who holds tea parties, and faces his fears (of spiders, mind you) to appease his daughters.too cute! Then, Sawyer gives us, Grey. Not just any career woman. Oh, no, no, no! She gives us a genuine genius who uses that intelligence to formulate a Hockey team that you wouldn't believe. A woman who stays strong even when people doubt a woman can do the job; hell, even when her teams' faith is wavering and proves everyone wrong. The two of them separately create people with such depth, but then you add their romance and just wow.

I felt there was room for comedy between Grey and the daughters that may have rocked this book, and a kick-ass scene where the ex needed a swift, 'Bitch, you better back the F$%* off'.

Their marriage of convenience for him to pastor a church and her to build roots in their hometown was a solid premise, but this book which had the initial feel of clean read than had odd and descriptive sex scenes which was okay but was the first surprise for me in reading. Also, there were points where I wanted to slap both characters into their own realities and/or move the action along. I also would have like a bit more morose back and forth ignorance and miscommunication between the two and more developed action segments.

Repentance is a book about second chances.  Its about living in the present and not allowing your past to dictate who you are or what happens in the future.

We met Kace Hayood in Meghans Bourbon series.  Hes the man behind the scenes in Jetts business.  Kace wants to help others get that second chance in life and better themselves.  And after working with Jett on his previous business, he is going to run the new community center, Justice.

However, Kace has his own past and demons.  He believes that he doesnt deserve that second chance in life but helping others is his way of coping.  Hes only had one person stand by him his whole life  Jett.  Until Lyla.

Lyla is a feisty and confident woman.  She knows that there is something between her and Kace.  And she refuses to walk away from him without a fight.

The interactions between Kace and Lyla are fierce and explosive  both in and out of the bedroom.  And like with all Meghan Quinn books, you have that hilarious and quirky comedic dialogue that has you dying of laughter.

This book seemed a bit more intense than others books I have read by Meghan and I really, really enjoyed that I could see another side to her writing.  And when you are able to make me go from laughing to crying (in public!), just by words, I truly believe that shows the strength in an authors writing.

For the most part, I agree with every one of them.  Cinderella and the Sheikh is a fun read.  I had a hard time putting it down.

The main character, Libby Fay, is a waitress trying to make a living.  Sheikh Rasyn wants a wife no one in his country would accept because he wants the Kingdom to go to his cousin.  From there our hero finds nothing goes the way he'd hoped.

I won't go into the details of the book.  Other reviewers covered that nicely with their input.

Yes, there are some font issues, but it doesn't take away from the flow of the story.

One review was negative, but the issue that appraisal had doesn't seem to be an issue for others.  It wasn't for me.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys contemporary romance with a handsome Sheikh in the mix.  You might learn a word or two of Arabic along the way.

At least theres plenty of tension to Claires story; it quickens the pacing nicely. But the plot arc is so familiar that it was a given how it would end. I do love that eight-year-old Claire uses her experience playing Tetris to find her way out of a bad spot.

The Infected are starting to communicate with each other using humming noises, and now they're developing purposeful herds. There isn't much about how or why this is happening, but its a nice difference from most other similar tales. We find out that even animals are infecteda rat bit Jason, but nothing happens with that. If the infection is zoonotic, shouldnt we see it passing to humans from animals in addition to passing to animals from humans? We do see interesting variations on the infected, such as a woman who appears outwardly normal but, following a bite from one of the Infected, can feel where they are.

Jake is a horrific character. He is straight-out evil. Hes a rapist and killer whos now been given something like the abilities of the Infectedanother truly stupid call on the part of the cabal of bad guys.

Meg is a strong woman because of what she has gone through and for that reason doesn't trust easily, she doesn't want to be told what to do, but then again who does, but realises ""In Megs limited experience, dating wasn't this easy. Of course, this wasn't really a date, but spending an evening sharing a meal with a man like Jake should have been awkward. Usually, she got tongue tied and more often than not, spilled something or tripped over her own feet. This was different. Being with him was effortless. His sense of humor was only icing on the cake of his intelligence, kindness, and damn, the man was gorgeous. Deep dimples enhanced his smile, and she smiled back. Conversation was spontaneous and genuine. Even silence as they watched people walk by was easy."" With love things work out which is something that Meg is learning.
Jake is a protector, always looking out for those he cares about and because of his history sometimes going a bit overboard. But in this case he may have concern because someone is watching.
You just have to love to hate Kirsten she is written perfectly, we have all met girls like her, and I can only hope I never end up like her as she even wears out her staunchest supporter.

When she manages to get an interview with Dylan Callahan, manager at the local family theme park Storybook Valley, about a marketing job, Jaine knows she will do anything to get the job. Dylan is impressed with Jaine's creativity and determination and decides to hire her. There's just one catch: there is no room for the marketing position at the moment, so until the end of the season he wants Jaine to play the role of Cinderella. While Jaine knows walking around a theme park in a princess dress wasn't her first idea of a suitable job, she knows it will eventually get her what she wants. But keeping secrets from your family, making children happy, coming up with marketing strategies, and developing a crush on one of your colleagues, all at the same time, is quite a challenge, even for Cinderella...

Oh, I just loved every bit of this novel, from start to finish; what a brilliant read! The combination of chick lit and fairy tale just works so well, if you ask me, and Stacy Juba created a thoroughly enjoyable and fun read which I can't recommend enough to any romantic comedy fan out there. I loved the fairy tale element brought into the story by Storybook Valley, the theme park in which the novel is set, but also the modern twist the author gave the story of Cinderella in the form of the protagonist, Jaine. The fairy tale elements are incorporated in the story in a clever way; the elements are clearly there, but the story reads like a modern-day chick lit novel.

I easily warmed to Jaine and thought she was a wonderful heroine. She's easy to relate to and I loved seeing her develop as a character throughout the story. There was also a great cast of secondary characters, such as Dylan and his family and all Jaine's new co-workers at the theme park. The story really had it all for me and I can't even begin to explain how excited I am that this is just the first part of an entire Storybook Valley book series! Overall, 'Fooling Around with Cinderella' is a fun, heart-warming, and simply magical read that entertained me from start to finish; I loved it!",Review: 'Fooling Around with Cinderella' by Stacy Juba,1449964800,,

For being only 36y/o, shes under an immense amount of stress and relies on nicotine to calm her nerves. One day, a low point in her addiction is witnessed by Thomas, a 25y/o programmer and Linas former personal assistant. Having desired Lina for 7+ years, he sees a perfect opportunity to both get Lina into his bed and cure her of her addiction. Thus begins their business arrangement for Lina to be Thomass submissive for 2 months.

Theres a lot of hesitation on Linas part to take a chance with Thomas on a more intimate level due to their age difference. Despite her confidence in her career, her self-esteem is surprisingly low and she constantly fears he would leave her for a younger woman. The book is written in alternating first-person POV, so theres a lot of inner-monologue and the reader gets a deep view into both of their personalities. I didn't expect the book to affect me as much as it did. That despite how much they admired and cared for each other, the potential to openly be in love was held back by societys taboos.

Thomas isn't your typical alpha male dominant. Hes described as on the thinner side and of moderate stature. He wears glasses and isn't the classic talk dark and handsome hero most romances contain. It was refreshing to have such a strong character not fall into the romance stereotype that only men of a certain look are desirable. And hes definitely good at the whole sex thing, trust me.
Lina has a traumatic experience that changes who she is completely, affecting her relationship with Thomas. And while I understand the decision Thomas made and can logically agree it was for the best, I still wanted to shake him and ask him WTH was he doing. I need book 2 out, STAT.

Be forewarned that the book does end on a cliffhanger.

Trigger warning: violence, some torture, and a particularly violent scene containing sexual elements that may disturb some.

As she starts to heal she realizes that she has to get away from Caine, and keep Evan far away from him.  Add to that the revelations about her father and mother- and damn-youd think that would be enough.  Her childhood nightmares are actually reality.

I usually read 2 or more books per day but it took me three days to finish this book.  I didn't like the hero and the heroine was not believable.  The hero didn't make sense to me.  One of his ""rules"" was to be late to appointments or reservations because he felt that people should wait on him no matter how long.  However, for some reason he was always on time for the heroine.  No explanation is given why.  He seemed to have a loving relationship with his family but he was an ass to everyone.  His brother is introduced in the story but there is really no reason why.  The heroine started out being one way but by the end she was different but not in a good way.

The ending was incomplete.  There were several instances where the wrong word was used.  My mind constantly wandered while reading this story and I had to force myself to finish reading.  Honestly the blurb is completely different from the actual book.  The blurb describes a promising book but the book just didn't deliver for me.

Adorable, Sassy, and  Hilarious Heroine -- Double Check.

Major Misconduct is a fabulous introductory book in Kelly's new series, Aces Hockey. I have to say that even though this book is mainly about Marc and Lovey, we get to meet several other players and man am I looking forward to getting to know them more too.

Lovey has pretty much come across as flighty and fickle to her family, so when she shows up at her brothers having quit her job and deciding to move to a new city, they think its more of the same. But Lovey has a plan, this isn't a snit, or wild hair, she's serious about moving somewhere new to start over and she has plans for her future career as well. But because of her history, she doesn't want to share these plans with her brother just yet, even though he's harping on her.  What Lovey didn't count on was meeting Marc.

Marc, is the Captain of the Aces. He's a good guy, dependable, Reliable, responsible and loyal.  Loyal to his team, to his friends.  Since he became roommates with Duncan, they've grown a little closer.  There's only one rule between the members of the Aces.  Sisters are off limits.  Too bad Marc's mind, body, and heart didn't catch that memo.  From the moment he sees Lovey, he's hooked, but he knows nothing can happen between them, he can't do that to Duncan.

As Marc and Lovey get to know each other the tension gets to a breaking point and eventually explodes.  Marc feels guilty and swears it can't happen again, but poor Marc just can't resist Lovey. But secrets have a way of coming out, and people can get hurt, misunderstandings take place and Lovey and Marc are left trying to figure it out.  Can they make a real relationship work?  Is their love strong enough?

I can't wait to read more about the Aces Hockey team and look forward to watching as each of the players finds their ultimate match in their own feisty heroine.

The Aces Hockey team series is ACES in my book.

The setting of this book enchants as much as the characters do. I could easily visualize the Irish coastal village and Keelin's grandmother's cottage and land. Keelin's relationship with Fiona is wonderful...warm and genuine. The backstory is handled well, and the author communicates the complicated family situation in a way that keeps readers from getting confused. The otherworldly elements entertain without going over the top into full-on paranormal. This is still more a romance than a paranormal novel.

Uneven pacing distracted me in places. The author also repeats key phrases and emotions--like ""soul sings."" Flynn makes a great love interest for Keelin, but the climactic scene between them, on the cliffs, is abrupt and less believable than the rest of the book.

Langgle,"Catch is a really fun, sweet novella that may not have the most believable plot in the world, but it's so engaging and earnestly written that the far-fetched storyline doesn't really matter.  The story is set during 18-year-old Miranda's last family vacation before she moves across the country to attend college; her impending separation from her family is forcing her to confront her conflicting desires to take risks and explore new things, while also wanting to stick to what's safe and familiar.  She's forced to face this conflict head-on--and make a decision--when her purse is snatched on the Vegas strip.  Miranda's sister gets the idea to call Miranda's cell phone and confront the thief...and not only does he actually answer, but he turns out to be anything but your typical purse snatcher.  Ollie is actually a young, good-looking, charming guy who might be willing to give Miranda her possessions back--if she'll play by his rules.  Of course, playing games with a thief, even a charming one, is definitely a risk...

Once the purse-snatching occurred, one thing that really kept me reading Catch was wanting to find out why Ollie took purses.  And while I wasn't a hundred percent convinced by his reasoning, I did like Ollie more and more as we got to know him better.  However, I found I was most intrigued by Miranda's personal struggles as she was dealing with the thought of leaving her home and family for the first time, wondering if she could become the kind of person who takes risks and embraces new experiences, both in love and in life.  The last third of the story didn't go the way I'd expected at all, and I was glued to my kindle till the last sentence!

As bloggers/readers every so often we come across a novel that attracts us based purely on the controversy it causes. You see this book is being banned.

We believe as avid readers ourselves that each and every single book written should be given a fair chance. It should be given a chance to be read by fellow readers/book lovers.

To Murder Matt is definitely not for the light-hearted. Its content is extremely raw, hard, explicit and quite graphic. And to be honest at times quite disturbing. It covers a number of disturbing topics and taboo subjects.

But as a reader we chose to read it, and we absolutely loved it. Yes it was an extremely hard read, but it was written in such detail and depth we simply couldn't put it down.

To remove a novel we believe is taking the rights away from readers who should be given the choice to read or not to read. We are definitely firm believers that every author should be given a fair go in this industry.

To Murder Matt..Is a read for everyoneAbsolutely not, but let readers be given the choice to pick it up, not just simply remove it from sale.

To Vevica Benoir thank you so very much for giving us such an emotional, hard, raw, gritty and hard read. The subject matter at times we found highly disturbing, but again never once did we feel as though we couldn't continue on with it.

The first half in particular had a pretty gothic mood and Ceri and Virgil have the sort of dark and troubled souls that a fictional vampire should have.  Many other books with vampires or werewolves simply depict these creatures as normal humans with some magical abilities.  The true vampire should be a dark, dark thing and this book totally got that.  The second half really ramped up the action with many horrifying events I won't reveal, (*coff* Maverick crashes his motocycle for instance. *coff*)but it sort of works out although there are some exciting cliff hangers to be resolved in a future book.  I especially enjoy books where formerly evil guys are revealed to just be misunderstood good guys.  Great work and I am going to read the whole series from beginning to end again now, so I can put it all together in order in my brain. :) This book is a huge lynchpin or milestone, as far as a couple of the LH series go.

The fog that plagues the privileged seacoast town of St. Ives makes the events only that much more ominous. Near the end is an incredible twist; the final words chilled me to the bone.

I just love a story where you know the main characters are attracted to each other but they are so emotionally messed up that they cant let their true feelings be known.
The reader is immediately plunged into the characters lives and you feel empathy for them. The banter between Grant and Daniels is amusing and natural.

Aaron Grant has been suffocated by his grief, living in an alcohol induced cloud since his wife and daughter were killed in a house fire. When his daughters best friend is kidnapped he knows he must sober up and find her before he fails his daughter all over again.

You don't know what happened to get to this point, it looks really ugly and you hope that everyone involved will be okay, but you don't know if you will stick around to ever find out what really happens.

The story picks up where the last one left off, at Benedict's apartment. Ben just told Ally that she was in danger, then he leaves her alone to make a phone call and to make a cup of tea. Huh? When he figures out that Ally has been abducted and the clock is ticking down, instead of looking everywhere for the love of his existence, Benedict is diligently doing his paperwork. Seriously?! And Moira, the person with the most to gain if Ally can't be found in time, couldn't possibly be responsible...could a vampire possibly be any more naive? Moira somehow managed to not only find out about and kidnap Ally, but her friends as well, in less time than it took for Ben and Ally to decide to become intimate. Golly gee, what'll happen next? Be sure to tune in for the next episode....sigh.

Believe it or not, the story line in this book is a bit better than the first one. Of course, it couldn't have gotten much worse (not worst!). But this is mostly because Ally's juvenile character and exclamatory sentences aren't as prominent in this book. However, the grammar is probably worse, if you can believe it. I showed a couple of the errors to my 16 year old son and the first thing he asked me was, ""Did you pay any money for this?"" Luckily I was able to tell him ""no"".

And the one thing that almost stopped me from getting these books in the first place - is anyone else concerned about the fact that the first two books in this paranormal romance series have the exact same names as the first two in Kelley Armstrong's ""Women of the Otherworld"" series? Of course, that is where the resemblance ends. They do say that plagiarism...er, I mean... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I guess it's not THAT big of a deal, but it just bugs me.

She is petite and boasts an athletic figure thanks to her passion for surfing when at home in California.  With a few secrets in her past, she may not be all that she seems.

Alreck Falstad is supreme alpha maleness.  He's tall, large, and handsome.  Think Nordic god who likes to grunt.  Let's face it, sometimes the lack of speech is way hotter than constant chit chat.  He's a not just a biker, but builds them too.  The big guy also has a bit of a soft and overprotective side.

Everything starts with the night Vail and Lisetta go to a party at a biker club.  First she meets fails into lust at first sight with a dangerous Alreck.  Then she witnesses a brutal crime when just went outside to get some fresh air.  So much for clearing her head.  At the will of Lisetta she puts off going to the police to report the offense.  When she puts her foot down and proclaims she will head to the authorities regardless of what the bikers want, she finds herself being kidnapped.

I enjoyed this one but it, in some ways, is quite a bit different from Claimed in Canada.  Its action packed from the beginning to the end.  If you're looking only for heat, you should note that this story doesn't bring any physical relations until the last quarter.  That doesn't mean that there isn't innuendo or chemistry being developed.  Vail comes across as being wound a bit tight; perhaps a little nookie earlier would have helped with that issue.

When Ezra is 20, and Naomi is 16.

Ezra finds himself growing attracted to Pastor Cabot, the man set to school him on what is expected of Ezra after he marries.  He finds himself yearning for a simple touch from the pastor.  As their lessons turn toward those of the marriage bed, of being pleased, of a husband pleasing his wife  it becomes clear that the attraction is mutual.

Though the stories of Sins of Lethe are dark, I cannot help but find them interesting and thought provoking reads.  A time where Texas is its own country, with their own Big Brother type government who have essentially put women back in time well over hundreds of years?  Hard to imagine.  But it comes to life in these stories in an entertaining way.

I don't know that I would recommend these to readers of the typical romance stories.  More of those looking for an interesting, dark, maybe dystopian type read.  Personally, I find myself thoroughly entertained with each new chapter I read as to the Texas of Arden Aoides future.",Interesting & entertaining.,1442793600,4,

It was a fast and easy read , not much drama , which was nice for a change. I read it in a matter of hours and enjoyed the fast paced journey Luke , Marlene and Nil go on. I fell in love with them all and especially Grandam D !!

Clearly Luke was a jerk for leaving Marlene 8 months pregnant to pursue his dreams of becoming a rockstar. But 4 years later there is nothing you can do to change that. So Marlene needs to decide - Let Luke in ?? Go with Finn ??

This should be an easy choice since Luke never seemed to care , but at the same time Marlene is realizing Finn is the safe choice , safe and boring , she does not love him or have that spark. After Luke walks into her hotel 4 years later she realizes their spark is still going strong. Marlene has survived being a single mom and making a stable life for her and Nil with the help of her parents & Grandma D. But will she survive the next 4 days with Luke in town determined to get her back and have his family ??

Grandma D gives great advice and she is a living example of what Marlene is facing now. Sometimes you just have to get over the past and do what is best for the future. Just because it fell apart years ago does not mean it will again. In a matter of days major decisions take place and yes it all happens so fast but this is the way it is with Luke on tour and Finn getting ready to leave. If anything you will fall in love with Grandma D and Nil !!

Book 1 was my first Susan Hatler book, and I'd had it on my TBR list since 2013. (Whoops! In my defense, I have over 5k books in my Kindle app that are still unread.) I liked the complexity of Ellen's character, and the likability of the others, especially Henry.

Book 2 - I loved the truth or dare game played throughout the book. It was a great way to get characters to be honest, not only with the other person, but themselves, as well. I wish there'd been more behind Gina's unwillingness to choose ""truth,"" but I found her likable and refreshing. The banter between characters (not just in this book) really held my attention.

Book 3 - I really like Rachel! I felt so bad for her, but could understand her motivations in wanting to stay home with Chester, her dog. Noah is a wonderful romantic lead, and perhaps an ideal of the sweet guys out there. My only negative point on this book was that it was SO short. The others are novella length, but this one is definitely a short. I wish there'd been more to Rachel's story in this book, as she was such a big part of Book 1.

Book 4 - I feel like this was nerd love, and it was great! Ethan and Kristen are history buffs, so their love story seems just perfect. After so many of the others not being enough alike to think they could date, this one seemed like two halves of one whole finally finding Mr and Ms Right.

Book 5 - Ahhh, the rules! I wanted to slap her friend! I know she meant well, but good grief, I'd rethink that friendship, especially if my friend wanted me to sign over my car! The HEA is there, but I was cranky at the characters a bit. (I was sick, in my defense.)

Book 6 - My favorite. Ohh, the bartender. I saw some of the ending coming sooner, and was a bit ticked at the MC for not realizing and then getting mad about it, but this book was so sweet. Every girl deserves that knight in shining armor!

I really enjoyed this short, sexy freebie about a big girl that hits it off fast and heavy with a budding rock star. I'm so glad I didn't let the reviews dissuade me from trying it for myself. Joe and Liss hooking up is probably a fantasy scenario that doesn't happen often, but that's the beauty of fiction. You can get lost in ""what could be"".

For some reason, I feel like I need to defend a few things I've seen others post in reviews--a girl that's hot for a guy that she's spent the better part of the night chatting with WOULD allow him to walk her home. She WOULD invite him in. And they probably WOULD get busy. It happens all the freaking time, folks. Is is smart? Maybe not. But that's the stuff real life one-night stands are made of. There's nothing unusual or unrealistic about her doing that. It HAPPENS. A LOT. There IS a such thing as instant lust that causes people to think with their nether regions. If it's a great hook up, they may be infatuated enough with each other to want to spend every possible moment with each other thereafter. That happens all the time too. ""I love you"" was never mentioned in this story, so I don't see how people would be bothered by the instant sexual attraction. Nothing new there. That's what folks who love sex like to call PASSION.

It's amazing to me how a reader's own life experiences (or lack thereof) influence their perceptions of how characters should behave in a story. They don't have to do what YOU would do in order for it to be believable for their character. Give yourself a pat on the back if you'd be able to resist such a guy and think rationally during a heated moment. Other girls would rather have something else than that pat on the back, and that's okay too. I think people would enjoy fiction so much more if they'd leave their personal judgments at the door and just let the characters do what they would do.

I can easily see how two people could hit it off fast. The heat would probably fizzle out soon, however, that initial lust and animalistic attraction is NOT unrealistic in this story. If you can believe a hot rocker who could have any chick he wanted would want to be with a big girl who works as a waitress with no other aspirations, the rest should be easy as pie to believe. That was the only fantasy part of this story to me. And since I enjoy characters that don't fit a typical mainstream mode, I loved that part too. 5 stars.

I should also mention there are a few editing issues--""week"" instead of ""weak"", punctuation errors, and a few extra words. That didn't take away from my enjoyment.",Different kind of rocker chick.,1388361600,,

This story is suspenseful & actually tackles hard topics such as kidnapping, rapes, human slavery. The autor tells you about the 18 yr old herorine named Gwen who is kidnapped and held -not for ransom but who is to go up for sale. The boss's son takes an interest in Gwen. Lance sees Gwen being brought in and something about her calls to him... When Lance next sees Gwen and she is trying to appeal to him to be let go, he tells her to mind, that by rebelling she will be hurt badly.

Lance started training Gwen in all things sexual, telling her that it would help ""raise her price"" and "" please her "" new master"". Lance was so conflicted. As the reader, you could see he really was falling for Gwen but he didn't want to get involved because of his family ties and bad things that could happen.

At times I was horrified by what I read...My stomach turned, I felt so like I was right there in the book with the characters. I am so glad that the hero,Lance, woke up and realized that Gwen was worth fighting for.

The ending was great! I just wish there could have been more of a wrap up than what was given. Which is why I have only given this book a 4.5 out of a 5 star rating.

This was a beautiful, light, fun, and sexy read. I loved Charlotte and Brooks' story. They were the perfect combination of sweet and sour, light and dark, good and bad. Who knew Charlotte harbored such intense feelings for the man hellbent on revealing all of her family's secrets? Certainly not Brooks. But he planned to take full advantage of those feelings to get what he wanted. I spent most of the book trying to decide what exactly that was. Because once he had Charlotte in his arms, he was a goner. It was fun watching his internal struggle between his heart and his work.

This is what I consider a cleanser book. When you read as much as I do, sometimes you just need a little something. Something to read that somewhat cleanses out the last book, clears any hangovers.

The word EXtreme and some of the blurb may lead one to think that this is on the border of erotic romantic suspense (plus it starts out with a reference of two brothers having a menage), but there's only one average sex scene in the story.

The story focuses on Charlie and Amber and for such a short book we get to know both quite well.  The secondary characters also seemed to be more developed than some of these mercenary team romantic suspense books.  There's also quite a bit of story showing how Charlie and Amber's relationship started then continues with a fairly complex suspense plot.

The reason I can't rate this story higher is that the main characters didn't really appeal to me.  Charlie and Amber read more as immature young adult types, and in the case of Charlie, then a competent individual who made it through SEAL training.  Amber makes stupid move after stupid move.  Moving to China without an actual job offer and little funds and there's a ""fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"" element to what happens to her.  In romantic suspense I don't expect my characters to be super heroes, but really, it occurs to NO ONE to just destroy the copy?!? The story could still have continued to just save Amber.

It's a very easy read that draws mainly from two sources written in the  aftermath of a battle known as Arginusae between the Greeks and the Spartans.

Athens sent her fleet, guided by her best Generals to meet and rout the Spartans. Two Captains were left to retrieve the survivors whose ships were sunk, as well as the dead. A rare but violent storm appears making it too dangerous to do anything but flee and so the survivors died and the dead remained in the water.

When word reaches Athens that her sons were abandoned the city was filled with outrage. According to their beliefs because they never received any funeral rites their souls could never go on to the afterlife. The Generals cast blame on the storm, but the people wanted heads to roll so they turned their ire on the Captains who then cast the blame on the Generals.

In the end it was the Generals who stood trial and just one voice, as has happened so often in history and in the present, uses his oratory skills to bring the rage of the people to peak levels and instead of using reason and logic, they condemned the Generals to death.

With their military leaders gone, Sparta began a series of attacks that drew Athens back into the war where, essentially leaderless, she was broken, starved, and subjugated.

'I have been staring at her for three months. Watching her. Memorizing her. For ninety-two days, Ive looked into those lifeless green eyes. And for ninety-two days she has inspired me in ways I never knew possible.
A muse, unbeknownst to her. Motivating me. Encouraging my darkest desires.
Im a man who knows what he wants. And what I want is the beautiful and broken Holland Howard.
My name is Jensen Paynephotographer, autocrat, lecher, Scopophiliac. I am who I am and I will notcannotchange.'

An emotional roller-coaster! And that is what I got.
Okay, we have Holland, our heroine. First, let me say that she made me cry. Like, really cry. Her tragedy spoke straight into my heart even if I am not in a condition to fully understand her loss and pain. Her happy marriage is ruined six months after her pregnancy...Betrayal leads her down to different paths. Months after leaving her ruined family behind, she finds herself working as a waitress in a bar.
This is where Jensen comes in.
Jensen is a mysterious and elusive man and he has his eyes set on Holland. Holland is oblivious to the fact that he has been watching her for three months and when he makes his presence known, she is fascinated by the dark photographer.
But Holland's heart is cold as ice and Jensen is infatutated with the mystery that surrounds her. After one night of passion, he cannot seem to let her go. Holland herself is even more drawn to the very singular tastes of Jensen Payne and cannot help herself but feel things that she hasn't for a long time.
They embark on a dangerous relationship, but both are keeping secrets from each other. Holland's past still tortures her, while Jensen's future is looming over them, darkening their temporary heaven.

What will happen when they both know each others' secrets? Will they stay or will they run?
I have to say that I loved the writing. It's the first book that I had the pleasure of reading from this author and I absolutely loved it! The character development was great; you could sense the characters' pain, you could see their struggle. The whole book was a huge page turner!

A high fantasy, Tiger House is fast paced and imaginative, with good cliffhangers ending each chapter. The main things that drew me out of the story were characters that felt a bit too caricatured: the villains are pure evil, the love interest is pure beauty and innocence, and the love foil (Jairus cousin Lucus) is pure jerk.  Our hero remains a little too passive for most of the book, always reliant on other peoples help to survive. He never wins any section of the Hunger Games type competition due to his own skills or cleverness, although he does, by fluke, gain language skills that make him valuable to his captors at one point. The character I actually related to most was the villain sorceress, Tekagi, as I could understand how her upbringing had made her cruel and scheming, and ultimately she is much more active in achieving her goals than Jairus is.

This is Jenna Monroe and Kellen Coulter's story told again but through Kellen's Point of View. I've read other books that tell the story from another point of view and this one had so much more to it and it wasn't just a rehashing of the story and changing a little bit. You get so much more from this story that you don't know or don't see in the other story. We get to meet a great friend to Kellen's Callum in this story, we don't hear anything about it from the other story. We learn about the fight that brought him into the Monroe household. We learn about his home life and so much more.

Laney wasn't a character that I particularly cared for in the first book but in this story I just hated her. She is all about her looks, her body, and her sexuality. She cares so much about money and materialistic things but she doesn't want to make it herself. She wants a man to make it and for her to be able to enjoy it. She is so judgmental and opinionated about things that have nothing to do with her. Her father is the one that made the money but she thinks that she is better than most people due to that money. I don't think she ever really cared about Kellen but just liked his looks, his body, and his potential to make her money. She enjoys the drama and those things but she doesn't really try to care about him as a person. And she tries to make it seem like she's the good guy and he's the bad guy when she cheated on him and never cared about his opinion. She just wanted him to fit into her idea of a perfect boyfriend, fiance, and later hopefully husband. I think she has some serious growing up to do and serious life experience to deal with.

Kellen is a great guy but he doesn't want to see what he's doing or think too hard on his life. He has so much tragedy and heartache in his past that he just lets his life go by while he numbs himself or pretends like things are a certain way. I'm very happy and thrilled that he finally has woken up and wants to do better. He realizes that his love for Jenna is something he shouldn't throw away and he should give it a shot. He's lucky that she has always been there for him and she hasn't moved on from him. Not many people would put up with the things he has done to her and still waited for him.

Jenna is such a wonderful, deep, and passionate character. She knows who she is and what she wants. She doesn't think money makes you better, she actually thinks that sometimes money makes things worse or harder. She doesn't judge others and she doesn't let others stand in her way. Her love for Kellen has always been there and she's patient and she never runs or goes away. He has dealt her so much pain through the years but she doesn't let it tarnish her or damage their relationship.

If you are into that sort of stuff like I am, you will not be disappointed with this book! From the first page, Danny and Skye pulled at my heart. I loved that the story didn't start with the beginning of them, but rather the end...for now. The majority of the story was spent with them pushing each other away and fighting the pull they couldn't deny and I loved every single minute of it. I was so entranced with this story, I sat down to read just the first chapter and ended up not moving until I had finished the entire thing. I can't remember the last time a book captivated my undivided attention like that.

Danny and Skye were such an unbelievably lovable couple. When they stripped away all the noise and were honest with each other, there was such raw emotion that poured freely from their souls. An undeniable chemistry that seemed to be written from birth, it made you wonder why they even bothered fighting it. But at the same time, I understood Skye's fear. I was angry with her for her decisions, but at the same time I got it. With everything she witnessed in the previous books, it made sense. But none of that lessened the love that was obvious between them.

I love that with this spin-off series to our original characters in the Hell's Knights books, Jewel has also included the guys and gals from Joker's Wrath. I loved seeing the two clubs come together for a common cause. This was started in Drifter, but it continued into Manacle with a heart wrenching twist that left me gasping for breath and furiously flipping the pages. I was pleasantly surprised to see the twist, or rather I should say, direction that she took this series in at the conclusion of the story. I can honestly say that I've never seen an MC book/series do that and it was refreshing to read. I could feel the terror pour through the pages that went into making that decision and it felt 100% authentic. I'm not sure if this is the end of the series or not, but I can't wait to see what other characters may get their own books.

Wow... I'm kind of speechless. I knew the first time we met both Meredith and Donovan that there was something special there. The two of them just fit. We really get to see that in this book. I loved the dynamics and the outline of the story. Here were a few spots where it seemed to drag a little but the drama and mayhem made up for it!

*

They've battled crazy Bruja, demons and now... they've got a few things coming at them at once. Meredith is having a daily battle with her brothers, who are trying to toughen her up and make sure she is ready for the Irish pack. Cause, seriously they're in a bad place. The true mates are called back to Ireland when the is a death in the pack. Donovan's second is murdered and the pack in chaos.

The chaos is worse than they first thought. Vivian, Donovan's third, who will now act as second is three shades of cray cray but until they can ""prove"" she's gone mad they have to bide their time.

But when tragedy strikes again, and a pup in the pack is killed, all bets are off. Both Donovan and Meredith have to find out what is going on, and who is the one behind this. The packs bonds are failing... if Donovan doesn't get control soon... there will be more deaths and the anarchy will continue.

Meredith, the once cursed wolf is not to be deterred even when she is face to face with the danger surrounding them. She stares down the threats and is determined to take it down.... even if that means she does trying.",A PACKTASTIC READ!!!,1490659200,,

Her plan to spend one hot night with her long-time crush would surely get him out of her system so that she could move on with living her life.  Of course, plans often awry, as does Candy's, the persona whose alter ego Emily takes on in her campaign to seduce her long-time love.

Once I told myself to just read it for the story, things went a lot smoother.

I like very much that this book took place in the art world. I am a huge fan of museum's and gallery's. It was nice to have a steamy romance without a billionaire that is going to solve all of the main female character's problems. I like that the main female character Greer was not discouraged despite all the plotting going on behind her back to destroy her art and her earning potential.

I did not like that she bought an illegal handgun on the street. If someone mugs me on the street and tells me to go back to the exact place I came from, I'm calling the police and I'm not going to just wait to be a victim again, especially when I keep hearing through the grapevine that all my artist friends are having their art and studio's destroyed. It bothered me that Greer was so strong as to not be turned away from completing her entry into the Phoenix contest, but instead of being actually strong and calling the police and legally buying a handgun, she results to common street thuggery. I'd rather have a legal firearm and every New York Police Officer on my side helping me.

I also didn't care for all of Greer's binge drinking. If you know someone is out to get you. Someone who knows enough about you to tell you where come from originally, why dull your senses with alcohol? That is the time when you need to stay frosty and be on your A game. If someone had come for her and she had her gun she would have been so drunk she'd have ended up a crime statistic.

I also didn't care for the fact that Hunter, who is supposed to be a strong male ran to Greer's friend Tasha instead of turning directly to the police. Why not just man up, instead of pulling his lady love's best friend into a potentially dangerous situation? Yes, he got a black eye, but it was purely for manipulative purposes. The bad guys do get put into jail thanks to Greer's best friend Tasha being an adult and not letting people victimize her best friend.

The story ends and I'm not sure if Greer and Hunter ever have any kind of happily ever after. I don't know if the author is leaving the ending open for a sequel or if that's it. Also after all that, neither Greer nor Hunter place in the top 3? Why then even put in how much the art gallery owner thought the two pieces were so beautiful and asking about a selling price. That made me think, I guess the sculptures weren't that great after all. Not only did they not sell but they didn't place in the contest. That was a major let down after all Greer had been through.

He shakes his head once. Youre everything.

I thought this book was an awesome follow up to Entice, I wasn't sure which way the story was going to be taken but I really loved where it ended up going! This book picks up pretty much right where the first book left off after Laurie learns of the latest betrayal at the hands of a man (or men) she trusted. I won't say what it was in case you haven't read Entice yet but its left her again in a position where shes questioning everything and left having to figure out what to do to move forward. I don't envy her for the situation she was in and the choices she is now facing but I felt that she handled it with such strength and I really respected her and her decisions.

At the end of the first book I was conflicted with which team I was on and who I wanted her to end up with. On the one hand we have the familiarity of James, her extremely apologetic yet one-time unfaithful husband, with whom she had been with since they were teenagers and whom she still loves despite all thats happened. And on the other hand we have the sexy and mysterious Liam that she shared several steamy nights with trying to forget the mess that was her marriage. Much like her I was very torn between the man shes always known and the prospect of the new and unknown.

When a family emergency comes into play she discovers which man will stand by her side and help her pick up the pieces. I have to say, I was not expecting it to go the way it did but I am sooooo happy with her choice. By about 25% into the book I knew who I wanted her to end up with, so I was very happy it turned out the way it did. It was all so believable and I know that if I were in her shoes I would have done the same thing, which really helped me connect with Laurie and with the story as a whole.

As Ive come to expect from S. Layne/Stacey Lynn, the writing was so strong and even though the book wasn't overly long, it was packed with emotion. I finished the book last night and even now, I get a little emotional sitting back and thinking of Lauries journey. As a married woman, I think this book is a little scary to think about because no one wants to find themselves in Lauries situation and putting yourself in Lauries shoes is a hard place to be but Ms. Layne not only heals Lauries heart by the end of the book but she also healed the readers heart along the way.

I really enjoyed this book, both books actually, and I look forward to Talias story. I also hope that we get more from a certain other character from this book because there is still a lot I want to know there!

His mother his only...supporter. They made due on the money that was provided by his father's company after he was killed on the job. My thought about him was that he was OCD--but you'll have to decide that for yourself. There's a couple of clues!

After his father was killed, it really didn't affect Corey that much since his father had never spent time with him, preferring to use his free time with his LEGGO collection and building models, which of course Corey was not allowed to touch...

Once the money was gone, his mother had to get a job to make more money than her teaching so she learned how to be a massage therapist. Corey's room was changed to one of the first floor since he had reached 800 pounds, so that he was able to set up a system for having pizza delivered. A young delivery girl, overweight, often delivered the pizza and was nice to say hello to him, but she never would come in...

Corey's mother established her business on the second floor--perhaps doing a little more than advertised. My hint was her ""brushing her teeth"" after every client but you can decide because of course Corey didn't know... but he knew his mother had some weird customers!

One guy named Jim would stop and talk to him before or even after his appointments... Corey enjoyed spending time with this new friend...

But one day a preacher man came to meet with his mother, which changed everything. For one, the man carried something like a vase with him and would leave it in Corey's room. Corey was confused when the man told him that it was the remains of his son Sam...

Soon Sam and Corey were having conversations...

Corey is a social networker, having 352 friends until Sam suggested he put his real picture up on Phasebook...

Then Corey accidentally dropped Sam and he flew everywhere. He didn't like preacher man anyway...

Columbus' first novel, 3:53 a.m. was much more graphic and violent in content and language. This time, he presents a subtle, but definite horror fantasy that, once again, forces you to read each and every word to comprehend his story. Not a bad thing in my opinion. Because it forces you to remember his characters and how they were involved...Take the ending for instance...

All I've got to say is that he should have been faster in listening to Sam...

His overall writing style continues as his first novel, however. In many ways, it's merely a copy of the journal he might keep. If his mind wanders you get to start with:

""Not long after creation. Not long in terms of the infinite. A single moment of frustration. Abandoning all his senses. HE shattered the first conception. Shattered it in style, of course. An explosion so bright even HE had to look away. Bursting into a billion tiny little particles. Atomic shrapnel. HE watched with a smirk as the particles joined with one another. Joined in a dance. Propelled together by a mutual attraction. Defiance. Later on He watched as THEY limped out of the ocean. Rebellion. Those unintended perversions. Those twisted images of himself. In time THEY became something else. God-like but not quite. These insignificant pieces lost in dissatisfaction. Micro-deities of imperfection. HE watches. Nothing more.""

I'm enjoying reading this new writer who claims he's not an author...But I will tell you that his writing continues to improve and he has an excellent grasp of using street lit to share his thoughts with his readers. A little mystery, a little strange, a little spooky, a little humor, a little...sad...

Great combination for those who enjoy the extraordinary, the unusual, the...strange...once in a while, like I do! Highly recommended!

Her parents were sent to jail for life for being con men, in which they pled guilty to their charges. Anna is hell bent on revenge against the people who conspired against her parents and treated them so poorly once their crimes came to light. Does Anna fully understand just how many people that might include? There are details to her parents case that aren't clear to Anna, which could either open up her revenge pool or shut it down. Did her parents really deserve what they received as punishment or did others have a hand in the sentence?

Liam Hawthorne is a bright young man who could have anything he wanted in life. He is from a very well to do family, has incredible looks, and a line of women that is never ending.  The only problem is that every single woman only wants to be with him because they want something from him; to use his name to get themself places, for money, or anything for their benefit. Once he meets Sophia, he thinks she might be different and be exactly what he is looking for, but is there more to her than meets the eye?  Liam has a dark side to him that no one knows about and he has done bad things in his life. What are those things he has done and will he let Sophia in?
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Anna is set on revenging her parents for the sentence they received, but she doesnt know exactly why they received such a harsh sentence or the details of the crime and the circle of people it encompasses. I enjoyed the suspense of the story trying to figure out what Anna has in store next to make her plan successful. The flirtatious relationship between Sophia and Liam was fun and exciting. I am intrigued to find out more information about Annas parents case and the parties that were involved in it and how they had a part to play in it.

I have one complaint about this book. I understand the blurb about this book references Fifty Shades of Grey meeting revenge but I do feel the sexual feel of the story follows too close to Fifty Shades of Grey story. The last chapter really has my mind doing flip flops regarding this story as to whether I will enjoy the rest of the series. This book seemed incredibly unique in its own way until the end.

Goodreads Teaser:
<blockquote>Tina Clancy is looking forward to a nice, quiet Christmas, but life has other plans for the newly-minted lawyer. As a Daughter of Saturn, Tina expects a healthy dose of crazy in the Zone, Baltimore's roughest docklands. Sparkling holiday lights that spontaneously combust  check. Garden gnomes swimming in sauna-like snow melt check. But when a blue blob crawls out of the red-hot sewer that's a bridge too far.

Soon, Tina is trying to exorcise a malevolent ghost, stop the ruthless local chemical plant from bulldozing her neighbors, and banish endangered tourists from her increasingly quirky home. At the same time, she's trying to figure out whether her drop-dead sexy client, Andre Legrande, is a gift-wrapped present or a stocking full of coal. Oh and Tina just may have accidentally opened a gateway to Hell.</blockquote>

The third in the ""Saturn's Daughter"" series, this book continues on with the same themes that make up the prior two books. The question of Good vs Evil is at the forefront, plus the concern of how any one person can safely act as both judge and jury. Yet that is exactly what Mary Justine Clancy, better known as simply Tina or Clancy, has been saddled with as one of Saturn's Daughters.

Having reached her goal of becoming a bonafide lawyer, Clancy is still struggling with the challenges of her legal career, and more importantly, the delicate balancing act that being Saturn's Daughter demands. She's been given enough power to alter the world, but no rule book to help guide her decisions. And the lawyer in Clancy loves a good rule book. Instead, all she has to guide her is an over-developed conscience.

Between taking advice from her cat Milo, giant blue blobs that may or may not be a hallucination, and all the Zonies she has come to love like family, Lawyer Tina Clancy spends an almost as much of her time in trouble as she does planning trouble. And when not in immediate danger from her brand of 'justice' she's in danger of falling for the two men in her life; ex-boyfriend Max, who now inhabits his cousin Dane's body, and her client/boss, Andre LeGrande. But even if she could decide between the two, she's recently learned that she is likely doomed to another year of celibacy if she wants to spare any child of hers from becoming another of Saturn's Daughters. Yet it seems that her planned celibacy may need to be much more specific than she ever imagined.

Even as Clancy grows as a character, so to do all the wonderful folks that make up her adopted home. The Zone protects its own, and Clancy is now fully a Zonie, not too mention their new legal mouthpiece, and unbeknownst to most, she's also their behind-the-scenes dispenser of real justice. She loves finally having a real sense of family, but not the weight of being the  judge, jury, and executioner, all rolled into one. Especially without some kind of guidance before she reaches her verdicts, rather than finding out after the fact if her choices were right or wrong. Waking up with a different part of your appearance altered in your favor no longer works for Clancy. She'd rather others benefit from her good judgement calls; her dislike of the personal benefit aspect of the job is just one more reason she appears to be one of the better Daughters of Saturn.

As with the other books in this series, the story line is smooth and entertaining, nicely matching the actions and emotions of the characters. The arc of the story is well designed and executed, with several peaks building up to the final, explosive ending. And although this book could conceivably be the final one of this series, I anticipate at least one, if not several, more books before this story reaches its end. By the close of this book several questions have been answered, just as several new questions have been raised. It makes for an entertaining and enticing series to follow.","Entertaining Series, But Needs to Be Read Chronologically",1415232000,,

This story dos not really have any mystery to it,  a hint of romance, but mostly a lot of discussion about archery hunting, which I knew and didn't want to read about again.  I've done a lot of deer hunting in my life, but with a rifle, not an arrow.  With a rifle, you have a chance of killing the deer outright.  It seems from the description in this book, with an arrow, you intend to wound the deer and let it suffer for however long it takes to die.  So, the story was weak and the archery part of it was icky.  I had several of these books downloaded but I removed them all from my Kindle.  I can find better ways to spend my time, for sure.",Meh.,1486771200,,

The book is called The Heart Breaker. As I already started reading it and must say I was VERY IMPRESSED. It had a great unique storyline, well-written, surprisingly sensitive and erotic at the same time.

As I continued to read, I realized how deeply in tune the author was with his characters. The emotions, perils, and dreams of the characters in this book were all exposed in a way I could not help but be involved. This is a sensual book too, but it is not your typical sex on every page book. It goes deeper. It felt like the author was courting the readers with details about the main characters and creating the anticipation they would feel when faced with a new love interest. By the time the lovers consummate their need, you understand their reactions and feel the blossoming emotions with every word you read.

I am so glad I was able to read this author's work! I will be following his career from now on. A man that can be this in tune with his emotions and write about his fictional characters in such a style is a romantic and worth reading.
