I foster kittens, and they all run and leap for it excitedly. I can move it above their heads, drag it along the ground, or just leave it out for them to play with! If I leave it out on the ground and one kitten plays with one end, the other end will move for another kitten and vice versa. The little pieces slide too, so they like to slide them around the wire. This also makes it more fun to even them out, hold the wire by the middle, and play with both ends in the air at once. Just be a little careful because before I got used to the feel and the willy-nilly of the wire, I wacked them a couple of times with it. (They didn't seem to mind, but it's worth noting.)

Might have to get another for my adult adoptee :)

UPDATE: Adult adoptee isn't terribly interested in it. More of a young cat thing I guess. Also, my 6 fosters tore the rolls off in about 2 weeks. Not a complaint at this price at all. Our fosters all got adopted, and we got a new cat dancer for the one kitten we kept. It's been in tact for a few weeks still. It DOES get caught in things like the carpet and string toys.

I have been feeding my cats a raw diet on and off for years, time permitting, but with a recent switch from canned back to raw they started having loose stools so I began adding this powder to the food and it has pretty much firmed everything up and kept it going smoothly (every few weeks they may have an episode, but almost all the stool is now firm). The kitties are happy and healthy, shiny coats and bright eyes. They eat the product readily when sprinkled over their food (I do one scoop for each cat per feeding, twice daily)--see attached photos. The powder itself comes in a little jar with a 1/8 teaspoon scoop that makes it convenient to add before each feeding. I was formerly using Fortiflora, which the cats found quite tasty (because of the animal digest) but it wasn't really doing much for the diarrhea. I much prefer this formula.

We have a whole home air purifier that runs 24/7 and I had thought this fountain would be a similar kind of white noise sound that fades to the backround but not so much. The motor itself is almost silent, but the sound of the water splashing into the bowl may literally drive me insane. Side note, my husband does not find it annoying in the least and thinks that I am oddly bothered by it.

Other than how I may lose my mind, everything about it seems great. The bowl holds an astronomical amount of water compared to a ""regular"" fountain. The material and construction are standard, with careful maintenance you could probably get years out of it. Some of the inner workings are quite small and the manual actually suggests a specific cleaning brush that you need to purchase separately. I haven't looked it up yet, but I assume the special brush is inexpensive and would make suggested weekly cleaning much easier.

We bought this fountain to see if it would help our GSD with the ""hole in his lip."" Normally when he gets a drink, he fills his entire mouth with water and inevitably half of it drips out of his mouth onto the hardwood floor. Time will tell on this one, but the first few drinks seemed to be an improvement. He can't dunk his whole mouth in the water like he normally does without the spout pouring water on his ears, which he is not a fan of.

Both of our dogs (GSD and Aussie) were unbothered by the sound. I had seen some reviews where the dogs wouldn't go near it but I wonder if they maybe had a defective motor as the only sound from ours is just that of running water.

Me and my four year old grand-daughter put it up on the bed and the only tool I needed to fetch was a screwdriver. It was out of the box and together in 35 minutes - and it only took that long because I took my time taking each piece out of the box and cleaned them first.

This is a lovely, sturdy crate.  I researched these a lot before choosing this Crown Pet Medium sized one (for an English Shepherd). I like it because it has the solid lower sides, which pups seem to want, but also because it keeps the dog hair from falling all over the room. It's nicely contained within the pet bed and much more tolerant when you have the dog in the house. I really like the plexiglass door cover to keep pups from chewing but it's removable when they get past that.

The color is surprising - this is one of those rare times that the color is actually accurate with the photo in the listing.  I chose the Expresso - and I did that at the last minute. I was going to go with the mahogany one but it just looked so light in the photo I switched, hoping that the reviews were right, and that the expresso was not actually what other vendors call Expresso at all. This is a lovely deep finish that actually matches my mahogany furniture very nicely. I have dark wood furniture throughout and the expresso is a perfect match.  So believe the photos if you're trying to choose. The darker one is not black at all, but instead a lovely deep brown like mahogany. If I could guess on the color of the lighter one (the one actually labeled mahogany) it looks more like a maple color, it looks lovely too and I'm sure I would have liked it, but I am so glad I chose the darker one instead.

I purchased some washable whelping pads for the first few days until I knew if my puppy was going to be a chewing, digging puppy or just be happy with her Kong, but I also purchased a lovely, thick 29"" x 21"" pet bed that is a perfect fit. It's thick and fluffy.

1 x Tubifex worms (.78oz each)
3 x Blood worms (.42oz each)
1 x Daphnia (.42oz each)

And I had problems with all of them. But for the sake of relevance, lets do the tubifex worms issue.

For a quick background, I have a large tank and great filtration (foam, biomax and purigen) and aeration. Cycled and has only 2 healthy goldfish.

My fish did not go near the tubifex cubes, they spread and made my crystal clear water dirty and it looks disgusting. I would not recommend any of Hikari's products to anyone that loves their fish. One of my goldfish starting eating a tubifex cube and now its dying (swimming sideways). Keep in mind my ammonia levels are about 0 and i also treat water with seachem prime.

You want my advice? stick to simple flake food, stay away from Hikari.

Only reason I ordered the set of treats is all the positive reviews, now I'm assuming most of them were written by Hikari employees.","Stay away from Hikari , killed 1 of my goldfish.",1431820800,{'Size:': ' .70 Ounces'},

So if you have ideas of recording things on a DVR while away, turn away now as this product isn't for you. Second, this isn't an internet connected camera so if you have plans to view things while away from home, this product also isn't for you.

It's basically just a camera to mount to view your pet, or can be used as a door camera.  You view events through the included LCD screen panel that is wirelessly connected to the camera itself.  Quality is good and allows one to easily track a moving object - a pet !  That's what the product is marketed for and it does it well.

Why get this over a regular security camera or internet camera?  A pan and zoom security camera can cost several hundred dollars just for the camera itself - then you need a DVR and if you want wireless, expect to fork over a few additional hundred.  Completely not necessary if all you want to do is track your pet.  Internet cameras, while cheap, often have terrible resolution and are not meant for outdoor use - the image will wash out in any kind of sunlight.  Also, this unit is weather resistant which means it will last for YEARS outdoors without cracking or falling apart - important factors which you need to understand that non-rated models are just not designed for - they are meant for indoor use only if you want them to last any amount of time.

Overall, I'll knock off one star because the price is a bit steep; could shave off a hundred and this would get the full 5 stars.","Good product, as long as you realize it's not a security cam",1394841600,,

A few years ago I started noticing some fleas on my dog that had become immune to the Frontline. One thing led to another and before I knew it, I had a massive outbreak on my hands. The fleas were in my yard, house and garage, all while my dog was still on Frontline Plus! I read several articles online discussing how fleas were becoming immune to the Frontline Plus, and my dog was living proof.

I switched my dog to K9 Advantix, and within just a few minutes, fleas were falling off dead. We bombed the yard and garage, and did boric acid treatments on our carpet to keep the fleas off of us humans, but my dog was happy and flea-free. It's been years now, and I have never seen another flea.

Some advice on application: DO NOT give your dog a bath for at least 1 week before or after application!!!! Your dog's fur/hair needs to be coated with its natural oils in order for this product to soak in properly. Most people over wash their dogs anyway, so give the poor thing a break with the bathing, and let the product do its thing. If your dog has dry hair or skin, add some salmon oil to its daily diet, then try the Advantix again.

This leash is about 6 feet long, which I think is the perfect size because it gives my pup some slack to wander, but he still has to stay close to me. The leash is finished on one side and a little rough on the other. Overall I was very impressed with how soft and supple this leash is. You don't need to break in the leather at all with use because its already soft. Because of this the leash is very nice to use. It feels food in my hands and I have a firmer grip on this leash that I do on a nylon leash. This leash does have a little give to it. When my dog pulls I can feel it stretching a bit unlike nylon leashes.

Personally I bought this leash as a going out leash because I liked the look of it (I live in a dog friendly city so I take him everywhere). The medium brown of this leash matches his leather collar, and the braiding on the leash give is a nice simple style. I think this looks a lot better than using a nylon leash, which I save for going to the dog park or getting dirty. This leash also came with a dog tag. Overall Im very impressed with the quality of the leash. The leather is beautiful and comfortable in hand. I think this would work well for most dogs, I would just caution owners who have dogs who chew leather or pull very hard because leather is much easier to get through than nylon and this leash does have some give to it which may give a dog that pulls to much freedom and control. Other than that I highly recommend this product and Im happy I purchased this leash at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest review.",... my medium size dog and so far Im very happy with this product,1453420800,,

I don't know why anyone thought to 'improve' or mess with what worked, but EVERY cat I've had in the last 25 or 30 years has hated hairball treatments that are either flavored or not flavored.

I heard this particular name, 'Cat Lax' mentioned on a TV vet show, so decided to try it immediately, even bought 2 tubes. I am SO GLAD I bought 2 tubes!

It's three weeks later and including today, I have had good success with THIS product. Whether I smear a small amount on a sleeping cat's front leg, or hold a cat down to apply to the front leg & paw, NONE of them has gone running wildly off acting like I gave them poison or set them on fire.
Mind you, they probably still think it's the old stuff, so I still have to be sure I have a hold of them if they are wide awake, in order to get it fully smeared on the paw, but today, 1 of my 3 young cats actually licked it from the tube and wanted more. THIS, IS the IDEAL way to give hairball medicine, in my opinion, and I was shocked and very happy. Last week another cat calmly wolke up, licked off the Cat Lax and went back to sleep. It MUST taste good.

Now, keep in mind,  I have tried the real gooey/runny stuff in the tube and the more firm stuff as well. One isn't anything you can just slap on the paw without monitoring the cat's movements or it's all on the walls and floor, furniture or bedding as the cats will try (sucessfully) to shake it off as they 'escape' from your grasp; AND I've tried the firmer stuff that needs to be really given in several places on the cat's leg in order to be sure it's not in a big lump of thick molasses, also getting all over and into everything except the cat's mouth.

THIS product seems to be a cross between both of those other formulas, soft enough to smear quickly and thoroughly in just a quick stroke with maybe a 2 second follow up, yet enough of the coagulation that in a small amount (1/4- 1/2 inch), stays in place until the cat licks it ALL off.

I think the secret to this product is less than 1/2 inch 2 or 3 times a week. The more you put on any cat, the more likely he will be to fling some or most of it off. NOW, that's for an unwilling cat.

IF your cat likes this,  it's easy and apparently better tasting than many, many other kinds/flavors, plus I'm sure it's been working.  I couldn't be more pleased and I think around here, once the cats figure out that this isn't the old stuff and not so bad, all three, (well, maybe 2 out of 3 anyway) will take it willingly out out the tube. Cat #3 gets a daily pill that he hates, so I have to grab him to do anything, BUT, he isn't flying off around the house for an hour trying to get it off, like with everything else I've tried. He walked away today, and calmly licked ALL of the Cat Lax off the 2 paws I put (smeared) it on.

When all else fails, some butter off your finger or a spoon-even in a plate works ok, but butter melts quickly, so we've changed completely over to Cat Laxative. Save the butter as a treat once a week!",The Cats Are Liking This! Licking It Too!,1466294400,{'Color:': ' Original Version'},

I decided to give Emmy's Best a try to see how it works since I have had luck with other brands. The bottle you receive is pretty large, and it would take quite awhile to go through it. The additive has a pleasant smell that did not seem to bother the animals. They did sniff it a second longer but went on drinking the water.

And it was supposed to be unstuffed--the head is stuffed.

Fortunately she did not ingest them, but only because I was monitoring her. This was a pricey toy, and dangerous for the price, since it was easily destroyed and had potentially dangerous plastic squeaker parts pulled out, by--of all breeds--a 14 pound pug missing 8 of her teeth.

There are a couple things I'd like to clarify for others overwhelmed by all the reviews. Some mentioned 1- the instructions not being user-friendly, 2- the pieces not being labeled and 3- having difficulty assembling the pieces. 1- If you can't put this together by looking at the photos, you should be studied. It's that simple. 2- My pieces weren't labeled by those stickers on most ready-to-assemble furniture, but the actual plastic was stamped with the corresponding letters. Not as obvious, but better than having stickers fall off in shipping. 3- It all snapped together quickly, but on one of the rise panels there was an extra nub of plastic that kept the male pieces next to it from snapping into the female ones flushly. A minute with a small saw blade, and no more problem nub.
So far these steps are working just fine. The other set he had were plastic, and so lightweight that he didn't trust how they flexed and shifted, even when he used them slowly. These are heavy enough to stay put on a rug, but I haven't tried them on the laminate floors. (The 4 rubber feet are maybe only 1"" little squares, which I'd add onto for use on hard floors.) He's even come at them from both sides at a run and no worries.

If a toy squeaks his focus is on getting that squeaker out, but with this grunting toy, he seems to enjoy the noise and has not tried to chew it out. The first latex toy I purchased was the pig at Walmart for Christmas (sold here on Amazon as well). The body of the pig is hollow and that allows the noise maker to be more accessible to the dogs teeth. The hippo's are stuffed with synthetic material and hold the noise maker firmly in place. It makes the same grunting noise as the pig. The Walmart pig's noise maker is beginning to tear lose. I believe the hippo will last longer because of the filling. My dog loves it as much or more than the pig. My dog is 42 lbs.

UPDATE: (03-15-2018)I had hoped these hippo's would last longer because of the stuffing holding the noisemaker in place. WRONG! I ordered the two pack.

My dog suffers horrible allergies and IBD nearly year round and I've been desperate to find an affordable solution to offer her relief.  Even turning to various dry foods that offer limited ingredients - desperation at its finest!  One food may help her itchiness, but give her tummy problems.  Another will agree with her stomach but she'll itch herself bloody.  It's been hard.  After many, many, trials with various foods I found this one.  It's reasonably affordable and the ingredients rated well with dog food advisor.  Her itchiness calmed down at first, with less tummy troubles, but then I noticed a huge hot spot forming on her side.  I put her on supplements and continued the food for another month - no luck, the spot grew larger and she had to see a vet.  Also noticed she'd begun shedding tons of fur in the middle of winter.  Not good.  Then she was hit with a horrible bout of IBD.  Had to change foods again.  Switched foods and treated the hot spot and IBD.  It hasn't returned, so it was something in the food.  For dry food, it's not awful.  There's way worse out there.  But if you're like me, trying to find an alternative that won't break the bank, this is a good option.

I got this for my macbook power cord after my cat destroyed two (well I actually ordered it after the first one got destroyed...  but it never came... a week later I was on to my third powercord). Anyway, I like that this covers the cord without making it completely hideous. I also like that I don't have to be terrified to leave my cat alone in a room with my computer anymore and after a month the smell isn't so noticeable. My cat has still chewed a little bit on the cord, but honestly because of the smell I got into the habit of putting the cord away so the cat doesn't have as many chances to chew on it anyway. Maybe that's how it works... behavior modification of the pet owner. We'll see... I'm a little worried that things are going to be fine until I forget to put the cord out of reach again....",One of those things that's sorta good... until its not.,1351814400,,

Both are adopted and lovable most of the time, but once the doorbell rings, the school bus stops, or someone walks past our house, they start uncontrollable, loud and embarrassing  barking, which frightens many children and people.  We had tried a citronella collar which worked ok, but  it would go off on its own or when a dog close-by barked so it was not a good training tool.  And within six months the collar stopped working. We then spent more  money on odd-size batteries which didn't help. A costly waste.

I thought I would give this whistle a try.  I actually had tried a less expensive whistle at one point, but it had no effect.  But after seeing so many positive reviews on this whistle, I thought I would try it.  It was amazing.  It made our Jack Russell mix stop barking immediately and just look at me.  It didn't seem to have any effect on our Sneagle (vet's name for her), but after a couple frequency adjustments, she, too, calmed down and stopped barking.  I've only had it 24 hours and hopefully it continues to work on them. If so, it is a life saver.  I'll advise how it goes over time.

(Additional comment):  I thought the instructions on how to adjust the frequency were not detailed enough to be helpful and there is nothing at all on there website about how to adjust it.  You must first pull off the black case that attaches over the whistle.  You just pull it off hard.  The adjustment circular screw is near the bottom of the whistle.  Adjust it as you blow to see what works best on your dog.  After you find the frequency you want, tighten the circular screw and replace the black rubber cover.  Luckily, both of my dogs respond to one frequency.  If you have multiple dogs, you may need multiple whistles with different frequencies.

I previously used Frontline and switched to K9 Advatnix a couple of years ago when I moved to Florida with my black labrador as I was concerned about ticks year round.  I currently reside in NJ and the ticks this year are especially bad.  This is the first year I am trying to K9 Advantix II.

My lab is a water dog at heart and goes to the beach frequently.  He also has environmental allergies resulting in hot spots and dry itchy skin.  Thus I have to bathe him every week during the summer months.  However, this has not seemed to affect the performance of this product. Applying K9 Advatix II once a month has been sufficient.

This product works well for keeping mosquitoes and other small biting flies away.  Unfortunately, the larger horse flies do not seem to be repelled.  In addition, as another reviewer noted, I have found ticks on my dog.  Ticks are very rugged and if they can latch on to any part of a dog, they will.  The product does not make them release upon biting.  However, and probably most importantly, the product does kill ticks.  I happened to find a couple of ticks about a day or two after they had latched onto my dog - one was dead and the other practically dead.  So it definitely works.  Please note that the best way to prevent your dog from catching lyme or any other tick-borne disease is to have him or her inoculated every year.

The product is relatively expensive especially if you have a large dog (my lab is 115 lbs - very tall and long legged).  Amazon provided an excellent price (even less expensive than the online vet website I normally purchase this and other product from) through PetCo.","Excellent Product, especially for outdoor dogs",1309651200,,

Inoffensive color and design.
HANDY TIP: though it can be -slightly- messier, filling the bowl as well as the reservoir when filling up helps a lot. Normally, you just fill the reservoir, turn it upside down, attach the bowl and then flip back over for zero mess and spills. However, the bowl takes a lot of water, so the jug will already be about 1/4-1/3 depleted after the bowl is filled. If you fill the bowl, then the jug, then just quickly flip the jug and attach it to the bowl right-side up, this eliminates that issue; also, as the filter for the jug makes the water come out more slowly, it's really not nearly as messy as you may think.",Good and Sturdy,1410566400,"{'Size:': ' 1 GAL', 'Color:': ' Mason Silver'}",

I started the product a little over a week ago and am amazed by her improvement already.  She is getting up much faster (not as fast as our chocolate lab yet but improves each day). She seems more relaxed and outgoing too which I believe is due to the improvement in her Joints.  My only confusion was the container lists the amount to take in the ""initial period"" and also the amount for maintenance but it does not specify how long the initial period should be.  My plan is to continue the initial period until her improvement levels out.  She absolutely loves the taste.. how do I know?  Because the drool starts immediately when I grab the container (she is not usually a big drooler).  She thinks these are her special treat and looks forward to them every morning after breakfast.  My husband told me this morning to order more as he was so impressed with how our girl is doing and I decided to write this review as I am sure there are other puppy parents sharing the same concerns we have.

That says a lot because she is incredibly picky, and it's a struggle to get her to eat her wet food brand that I feed her.  I have tried multiple, healthy, wet food on her and she will only eat the one.  I have to sprinkle some dry food into her wet food in order to get her to eat it.  Dry food isn't good for cats, I know, so I just give her a little bit to entice her to eat the wet.

Grain isn't good for cats, and my last cat ended up developing IBD because I fed her cheap dry food that I thought was good for her because it was a urinary tract infection kind.  In the last year of her life, I had to put her on steroids in order to regulate her bowel.  It was awful.  Sometimes, it would hurt her to defecate.  After reading about cat food, I felt terrible because I most likely did that to her.  I didn't know.  She was also overweight.  I did eventually train her to eat wet food, but it was a little too late. Cats have to have moisture in their diet or the develop kidney and digestive issues.  It was very expensive to treat her, and I eventually had to put her to sleep due to advanced kidney failure.

Please don't do that to your cat.  Now I know, and my current cat gets grain free wet food only (besides the little bit of dry that I sprinkle in).  She gets a high moisture cat food.  This food seems to fit that criteria as well.  It is runny, but it still has a lot of substance.  The fact that there is a bunch of moisture in it pleases me.  It doesn't contain Carrageenan, which is also a plus.  Carrageenan is suspected to cause digestive issues as well.

This appears to be a really high quality cat food.  If you are concerned about feeding only tuna (and some people are), you could mix this with a can of their grain free chicken chunks cat food.  With my cats regular food, I mix tuna and chicken together, so she doesn't have only tuna.  I have also read that tuna and salmon are not a good food for cats.  I still feed it to mine, because she won't eat just chicken for a wet cat food.  Sometimes, you have to pick your battles.

The quick link SHOULD have been larger as this toy specifically states it is for a LARGE parrot yet has a quick link that is for a MEDIUM parrot.  The jaws of the quick link wouldn't fit around the bars of the macaws cage but did fit nicely around the African Grey's cage (a cage for medium-size birds).  The length of the quick link is also much shorter than the appropriate size for a large parrot cage.

This is common among bird toy manufacturers who obviously pawn off an insufficient size hanger to save a few cents & is most irritating.  This is a common problem when ordering on line as one cannot see the size of the quick link.  I will no longer purchase any large parrot toys from Amazon due to this.

Apparently the manufacturer felt they needed what meager cost they saved than my repeat business.

Design flaw - a small chain is threaded through a center hole in the wood pieces & when the bird chews the wood pieces (which they are SUPPOSED to do) they IMMEDIATELY cracked & fell off - not lasting any time.  The chain will not remain symetrical once that happens & becomes lopsided & one has to repeatedly pull the chain back through the openings of the PVC connector.

If I had designed this toy (especially for the money it sold for) I would have at least put SOMETHING fastened to the chain at the very top (a cotter pin, acrylic disc, large heavy plastic bead or raw hide chew) to prevent this from happening. My birds quickly lost interest in this toy as it quickly no longer had 4 legs spread in a square but the pvc was hanging vertically & the chains were all in a row side by side.

They wold push through one flap, but when the saw another flap they would stop and back out. Needless to say it was a costly experiment that ended up back in the box.

The detailed review:
My house and yard is home to four rescued dogs of various sizes and temperaments.  Trying to find something all will enjoy and can be used both inside and outside has been an impossible task.  I took a chance and ordered one Kong in hopes at least one would use it.  Opening the package released a strong, rubbery smell which, thankfully, diminished over several days.  Initially, none of the four dogs had any remote interest in the toy other than a quick sniff when it was bounced across the floor.  Once loaded with treats it was another story entirely.  It took a few days of repeated use but now if any of them see me holding the Kong they sit eagerly and fully alert until the Kong is filled with treats and placed on the floor or given to one of them.  It is indeed a hit and currently the most desired toy in the house.  All enjoy it with treats inside but my two chewers will chew on it just for the joy of chewing, treats or not.

The large Kong is more approiately sized for my larger two dogs, 65 and 85 lbs.  However, my Australian Kelpie at 30 lbs., the smallest dog and most aggressive chewer, has no problems getting the small end of the large Kong in his mouth and going to his spot to gnaw on it at his leisure.  After 3 weeks of continuous use the Kong has held up well and other than a few tooth marks is undamaged.  Immediately after finishing this review I'm ordering 3 more of various sizes so each dog can have his or her own.

All four dogs rate this ""two ears up"" for a total rating of eight, their highest possible rating.  Wish I'd purchased these sooner.","The Kong gets a perfect ""eight ears up"" rating.",1298937600,"{'Size:': ' Large', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",

I expected this Plush Chicken would have a similar sound, only a cluck, cluck, cluck instead of a quack, quack, quack.  Instead, I got a screaming rooster which scares my little foster dog.

I started with my pup (Labrador) in the house with it so that I could monitor her and teach her not to chew on it.  She has done quite well.  Now this crate is in the back of my pathfinder where it stays, and the hard crate is inside the house.  The little pad that comes with it for the dogs to lay on does not have the same quality as the rest of the crate.  We took our first 2 hour trip last weekend with our lab, and by the time we got to where we were going, she destroyed that pad.  So I have since had to put my own blankets and such for her to lay on.  Other than the pad, the sides are good and strong, I like all the ventilation for her to get air, and she seems to be comfortable.  Since removing the cheap pad altogether, there seems to be less of an urge for her to even try to chew.  crate is light weight which is also a plus.  using the two bars to expand the crate, material is very taught, so you have to just be careful not to pinch your fingers.  I like it that tight though, it seems more stable.  Overall, I would buy this crate again and again.  No zipper problems either.  Also, when measuring, this crate is true to its measurements.  I have a 42inch hard kennel, but the space actually used by the dog is very close to this 36"" soft crate.

My little terrier was jumping and running as she was right there too!

Both dogs have never even given thought to getting into the trash again. That incident took place several weeks ago and I have left the can lid up since then with no trash on the floor.

Note: I was not able to get full fluid motion with the feathers as they are in a large bathroom until they are cured of their colds.  I did get full motion with my adults, and they were not as interested....I can't be sure if it's the bell distracting them or something else, but they simply did not seem to enjoy it as much as the family in the video. In fact, one of the adult cats seemed rather put off by it, and she generally adores feathers.  I have other toys with bells that they enjoy, so I just cannot imagine why they weren't crazy for this.

Overall the price of this toy is great for what you receive, but the way the lures/string are attached poses some issue during play when compared with other toys that the Bird Catcher is trying to duplicate in a condensed form (Da Bird, the Cat Charmer....both of which I've purchased).  When the feathers are spinning and flying, the motion is full and fluid, but at times the string gets tangled with its own lure, and other times the string gets caught in the feathers.  This happened in the video, and we only played for a few minutes.  The string is rather stretchy = less control of movement.  Also, if you want to allow your cat the satisfaction of a good ""catch"", (which usually means they get to drag their prey off), it means dropping the handle once they've got their kill in their mouth.  Be a little more careful since this is a wooden handle.  Each of the attachments has a bell.  I believe it can be removed with effort, but be careful as the lure openings are tricky.

I'd recommend this toy to someone on a limited budget.  Personally I have more recently tended toward wire lure toys, as they are durable and provide a good amount of control.  The cats are able to get the toy in the mouth and pull with no give, which they seem to enjoy.

Above all, regardless of what type of wand toy you choose, please DO NOT LEAVE THEM OUT.  There are several reasons for this:
1) The wire/string/rope can get caught around a body part and harm them. (I know of a cat who lost a leg due to a wand toy getting caught in it. Imagine if it got stuck around a neck.)
2) Cats enjoy this bonding time with you.  Wand toys are meant to be an interactive experience.  No toy is as important as time with you!
3) Hiding and rotating toys will keep them fresh and new for your pet.",Great starter toy!,1463788800,,

He is a fast eater, so we started giving him a portion of each meal by using the Tricky Treat Ball to help slow him down. Though it only took him about 15 minutes to clear 1/3 cup of kibble out, it has slowed him way down compared to his bowl. And watching him chase the ball around is adorable, too! He can be an aggressive chewer, so I don't plan on leaving the ball where he has unlimited access. However, this would probably be fine for mild or non-chewing dogs, the ball is made of what feels like a sturdy material. Would definitely buy this again!

UPDATE: Our puppy is now 15 weeks old and still loves the ball. We actually do leave it out all the time and it is showing no signs of wear & tear. And trust me - he LOVES to chew. He carries it around the house even when its empty. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to any dog parent.

While I like the bowls okay, I now only use one for food servings, as my dog drinks a large amount of water, and this causes the bowl to need to be refilled multiple times throughout the day. I like the laminate coloring on these bowls, and find them quite cute, however the internal ""All Gone"" message began rubbing off almost immediately, so I just ended up scrubbing them both off, in fear my dog would ingest the paint or coating used for the letters. So, the ""All Gone"" message lasted for about three days before starting to come off, causing the need to just remove it all together.

I am a pet owner that likes to make sure my pet has the best, cleanest care possible, so I wash his food bowl after every use, and in doing so the rubber, non-slip ring around the base of the bowl comes off nearly every time, and I have to stretch it back onto the bottom of the bowl. I feel that these bowls could have been put together better, however I gave them a 3-star rating because they work for their purpose of feeding food, and have a cute appearance from the outside, but that's about it.

I originally purchased these because I liked the color, and I thought the ""All Gone"" message was just adorable, but considering that is now gone, they're just serving their purpose at dinner time.

There seems to be some sort of fiberglass structural component, and it is being revealed as the inside layer disappears. The areas of disintegration are sticky to the touch and I'm sure it's not very good for my snake to be touching. I bought this because it's the perfect size for my adult ball python to curl up in and feel secure, but still have space to eat inside, and he's always touching the sides when he's in there. I did not notice it last time I washed it (mild dish soap and a sponge), that was almost a month ago. I do a thorough cage clean once a month and spot clean as needed the rest of the time. So, since I washed it right when I got it too, after its second wash, the interior is deteriorating and leaving a sticky residue on my snake.
Unless you plan to never wash this product and if you are keeping it in desert environments (ball pythons are tropical and the cage gets regular misting to maintain about 75-80% humidity), do not buy this product. It does not hold up to moisture. It did also crack on the side, but I could have lived with that if it was the only problem!

I have 6 cats and my house NEVER smells like urine (4 boys, 2 girls). It is also very low in dust. I add pine bedding (the kind for rabbits and hamsters) on top of the pellets so it's softer on my cats feet and they are more willing to use it. Sometimes they don't like the way the pellets feel on their feet, but with the pine bedding added on top it makes it soft and more easy to dig in.  I don't really follow the directions though. I only cover the bottom of the litter pan with the pellets, then cover with bedding. I scoop 2x a day and add more pellets and bedding as needed daily. This keeps it from getting too wet and makes it easier to clean. Once it starts turning to sawdust it gets softer, but I scoop out all the wet powder twice a day (takes me 3 minutes 2x day to keep 4 boxes clean).

This is a very easy to use product that will collect and remove excess hair from your cat or dog.
I am using this on my cat who does not like the metal or plastic brushes designed to collect hair. (My cat is Kayla and she is the pickiest.)
This is very easy to use. You just slide this onto your hand and you are ready to go.
I have large hands and it was perfect. It also has Velcro to adjust at the wrist so it will fit both large and small hands. The total length is 9 and it is approx. 6.5 wide.
The bottom of this glove is a very grippy rubber material. Unlike the other combs-brushes, this has small nubs on it and you simply pet and massage your cat from head to tail to remove all that excess hair which always ends up on your clothes or furniture.
When hair collects, just wipe it out into a can and go back at it until done.

Cons  Only con I can think of is for left handed people. Think they need to make a right and left hand to choose from. I am right handed so this is perfect, but I think left handed people may want a left handed glove.

Summary  This was a very easy to use glove and was very effective in removing excess hair from my cat who does not like to be touched. She loves being gloved and it is no longer a challenge. And the best feature is that you can use this on wet and dry cats-dogs. Still want to try to use this while bathing my cat as getting a lather is always hard and it seems like this would be great to help with getting a lather and removing the hair at once. Note  I will make an addendum to this review when it is time for Kayla to get a bath. Would recommend to friends and family.

I don't know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.

Please note I have no relationship with this seller and Im not compensated in any way for my review. I did receive this free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.

This bed really appealed to me because I've owned the cedar stuffed/plaid/fleecy kinds of beds before with my prior best friend, a standard schnauzer (RIP, sweet old pal!) and now that we are finally ready for another dog in our life, and because I'm more eco-conscious, I'm ready for something a little different bed-wise.  I bought this based on reviews, and because I was not liking the ""normal"" beds available through costco, petsmart, or even amazon.  I've seriously owned a lot of dog beds, and I am DEFINITELY impressed with the quality of this cover.  Hopefully, the zipper doesn't break or anything to change my mind!!  Even if it does, though, I bought the mesh insert that you stuff first.

This is a high-quality canvas duck tough cover.  You stuff it with your old jeans, worn out sheets, old dry towels, you name it.  Instead of ripping up a bunch of stuff for rags, or sending it off to Goodwill, you can stuff a lot of it into the handy mesh stuff bag (sold separately) and then push it all into this darling cover.  $25 plus $14 for the stuff sack, and that's MUCH less than I paid for the cedar plaid fleecy beds that I used to buy.  Not only that, those beds all fell apart or left a lot of dust because they weren't washable.  I already have the old clothes and some old Ikea sheets I cannot stand to sleep on anymore!

So, the way I've been told to use this new type of bed if you have a puppy coming:  stuff it with recently worn/old clothes, recently slept in/old worn out sheets and blankets.  This helps the puppy become really accustomed to your family's scents, and calms him.  Now I need to find a crate mat that is as great.

The sacks will hold a LOT, this medium sized cover is quite large, as most people are stating in their own reviews.  The canvas cover is washable (I got the red one with the bird, so adorable in real life!  Definitely a wash on cold separately item.) And if you dump everything into a washing machine that's inside the mesh, you've got a fresh clean bed for your exhausted doggy!

Once that started all I could do was try to anchor myself against him. I had zero control and because the hook for the leash is on his back, I had no way to physically correct him. I will say that it seems decently made. It held up to his pulling while I used it and the padding on the part that goes under the front legs is very nice. (He had sores under his legs from the harness that was being used on him at the shelter.) We've had the most success with a normal choke chain (I refuse to use the prong one).

I was taking her home for the holidays where there are non-dog people so wanted to make sure she was extra clean. I hate all the perfumey smelling shampoos and really do not want my dog to smell like flowers, I just don't want her to smell dirty so I gave up buying online after a few that were too stinky for me and I went to my local petstore and this was one of the few that did not smell bad to me and I have used their spray before and knew I did not mind the smell so gave it a try. Bathed my dog- nice suds even though I bath her outside so the water is not hot. I brushed her b/c she sheds horribly after a bath. I took her to the family gathering and felt bad b/c she was still shedding that day which is typical after a bath. Then I didn't notice until a few days later when all the sudden she was shedding less than normal and was soooooo soft. I have never felt her fur feel that soft! I could smell the shampoo if I put my face up to her and it was a pleasant smell but it was not the first thing I smelled everytime she was near me- this is how I prefer it. It was the first time In the 2 years I have had her that I felt like a bath made a real difference. The softness did not feel like it was from extra conditioner type things on her coat, it just felt like soft clean dog fur. That was 2 mos ago and now she still feels soft but I actually want to give her a bath! As far as shedding- I definitely brushed her more than normal and maybe that was nothing to do with the shampoo but in the past I rarely brushed her because no matter how long I did it I seemed to get the same amount of hair off her. That seemed true after this bath too until a few days later there was just less fur when I pet her. Shedding varies with season and such so I won't say for sure it is the shampoo that improved that but wow... I cant find anything bad to say about this stuff! A tad pricey but I don't mind paying more for products that work so well. I am more careful about using and not spilling b/c of the cost. Good stuff! Give it a try!

I just kept putting them on top of it and with in a few days they were constantly on them.  They really do hold a fair amount of heat.  One of my cats was found when I was living in Florida.  I moved to Michigan a few months after officially taking her in.  She hates winter and being cold.  She's basically glued to this mat 24/7 now that it's getting chilly out.

Her preference is for balls: tennis, softballs, rubber balls, hard baseballs, anything round that bounces. When a ball is not available, she'll come over to us and drop a rock at our feet. While I usually tell her ,""no, I will not throw a rock,"" Sadie's acting chops are finely tuned, and I sometimes give into them. That she finds them is a tribute to her and her breed, I suppose.

The problem with the objects mentioned above is that they're not always safe for either dog or home. Rocks and baseballs are obvious, but our vet (I mean, Sadie's vet) informed us that catching tennis balls can be rough on a dog's teeth.  Enter the squirrel, a product from ""Chuckit,"" the people who invented the Chuckit flinger--a whipping arm that enables you to toss a ball several hundred feet for a great canine work out.

THe ""Flying Squirrel"" won't go as far as a Chuckit flung ball, but it can hover a bit when thrown right, and may be desireable for somewhat older dogs, or any dog on a hot day.  Because of it's aerodynamic properties, I find it easier to throw than a frisbee, although it won't go as far. Again, this could be an advantage.  It's covered in soft material, and Sadie has yet to rip it or chew threw it, contrary to one reviewer's experience here.  I'm wondering what kind of dog that person has, the ""sporting"" dogs were bred to retrieve fowl (and tennis balls?) without injuring (well--further injuring--since the bird has already been shot!) or clamping down on the prey.

I have to admit that if a ball is around, the squirrel gets cursory attention, but it seems to have more appeal than a rock.  I think it's good for variety, or when you or --especially--your pet want a quieter, less energetic day of throwing and retrieving.  The bright colors and relatively slow flight make it easier to track and find, and it fits easily into a backpack or a backseat so you're ready when your dog lets you know it's time to run!","4 1/2 Nothing Beats a Tennis Ball, But This Works Well",1154131200,{'Size:': ' Medium (10 in x 10 in)'},

I have been washing his bedding, and mine, since his bed is on top of my mine, in hot water quite often. I am vacuuming every day.

I bought this based on the good reviews for it.

I'm using it precisely as directed. I thorougly saturated his coat with it from muzzle to in between the toes and worked it into his coat all over quite well and even left it on the second time for more than 5 minutes. Every milimeter of him was covered. He was not a happy camper, but he stood patiently while I let it soak.

I saw some fleas come off during the rinse, but after he was rinsed well and dried, he's still scratching all over. It's been a few hours now.

The first time I bathed him with the product, I saw fleas again the same night. He's just gotten the second bath (three weeks later and two weeks after his Frontline treatment). If I didn't have a hernia that prevents me from lifting him in and out of the sink, I would try this more often.

Of course, plain water would rinse fleas off him just as effectively. He doesn't have ticks, that's a much more difficult problem, but fleas do rinse off.

I did some research and it seems that there are rumors around that fleas are developing an immunity to Frontline, but I seriously doubt they've developed an immunity to this product, so I guess it just doesn't work.

Update 7/24/12:

I tried this shampoo again twice after the previous update. It is completely ineffective. I might as well have been using water alone. I was watching fleas walking around his body while the shampoo was still on him. A couple of live fleas went down the drain and that was it.

Immediately after drying Pepper, I saw live fleas on him.

Four days ago, I finally received a dose of Comfortis that I ordered here on Amazon and that did work immediately. The fleas began to die within 30 minutes and although they do still bite, they die immediately; since they don't have a chance to lay eggs, the infestation is dying off.

Vacuuming and washing of bedding is essential until they're all gone, but he is so much better now, he's no longer scratching and biting himself raw.

The online vet recommended using only an hypoallergenic shampoo, so this one will be donated to a local shelter. He told me he couldn't recommend ANY flea shampoos at all, none were effective. I guess I wasted my money on this one.",Doesn't Kill Fleas on My Dog.,1340409600,{'Size:': ' 16.9oz'},

Finally, a food that I am comfortable serving to them for quality, they all DEVOUR within minutes leaving none to waste and all their skin and coat issues are gone.

The puppy formula is the perfect boost for our very senior dogs. In the future when we have a puppy I will most definitely consider feeding them TOTW Salmon Puppy formula for healthy development.

Our dogs love the salmon flavor the best though they obviously enjoy Taste of the Wild over all other brands of dog food.

One cat, the one with a tendency to inhale rather than chew, hawked up the treats an hour or so later and left a horrible dye stain on the carpet.  I don't know WHAT they are using to color these treats with but even if it's just beet juice, it's way too much color.  Beef Cat treats don't need to be blood red unless the cats eating them are starring in the true Blood TV Series, ya know?

Finally, Hartz doesn't have a very strong reputation for quality and in reading the ingredients, it's easy to see why they are in no danger of changing that.  The major ingredients are corn, grain and corn by-products.  None of those foods are really very good for a cat in large amounts  Most Cat treats do use some kind of grain flour to bind together the protein ingredients but the first ingredient listed is the one that is the most present by weight.  Therefore, a decent Cat treat would list either ground cooked beef or chicken or whatnot as the first ingredient.  How much actual meat is in these treats appears to be negligible.  I won't buy these or feed them anymore to my cats.

You know, in the time it took me to scrub the red stain out of the carpet, I could have pureed some poached beef liver, mixed it with a little bone meal, mashed potato & mashed carrot and  then baked it into my own crunchy cat treats that would be good for my cats.

Initially, our little girl wasn't too impressed with the bone, but she has grown to absolutely love it! I think it was too big for her at first but now that she is 65 pounds it is perfect for her! She could chew on this for hours, but we take it away from her after a while. The bone does become a bit rough and sharp after she chews it for about a week. However, based on another review, we bought a low cost dremel and sand the bone down for a few minutes each week which has dramatically prolonged its lifespan. I think the bone being a little rough is okay because it helps with dental care but we started using the dremel after seeing blood on it for the first time. In short, our 65 pound 10 month old puppy LOVES this toy and you can make it last for several months with some minor weekly care via a dremel.

(I have a cat with a urinary tract condition and my vet has recommended unscented clumping litter as one of several strategies to help him with his condition.)

As the other reviewer has mentioned, there is an odor or fragrance when you first dispense the litter.  I agree this is not quite unscented, and that's why I took a star off.  For what it's worth, this fragrance does not persist for long; it pretty much dissipates within a few minutes.  I'd say the dust level of this litter is average.  It's not low-dust, but it's definitely not the dustiest I've tried.

I like that this comes in 25-lb boxes instead of just 20-lb boxes.  I can get by with buying three of them instead of four.  This is easier on me financially, plus I don't have to cart around quite as many boxes each time I buy it.

But what I really am most enthusiastic about is that the odor control with this litter is very long-lasting.  I have four cats and four litter boxes.  Naturally, one litter box is more popular than the others (I don't claim to understand cats' thinking!).  I scrub the boxes and fill them with litter about once a month, scoop about three times a week, and even in the most popular box, I never get a urine smell.  The litter clumps as well at the end of the month as it does at the beginning.  (Occasionally I add a refill box of litter partway through the month, to top off any low boxes.)  I am thus able to remove the urine clumps, and my house does not smell like cat urine anymore!

For what it's worth, my cats are not at all picky about litter.  They've gladly used whatever I've provided, which includes the Fresh Step.",pretty good odor control,1357862400,{'Size:': ' 1 Pack'},

It flies great and he has no problem catching it as he is a fast runner.  We've only found one other toy that is as durable as this one for our dogs.

I have 2 senior doxies, male 16 and female 15, she can eat a car and pass it without wagging a tail ,the weather can change and he will have diarrhea for days. He had a really bad bout of it ,I had poo everywhere,he was miserable as was I. I started researching ,had given him Imodium in past with relative success ,this time it seemed less effective. I ordered Bene- bac and along with changing his food to white rice water recipe for first 2 days then remaining days added little broth and small spoonful of canned pumpkin(not pie filling)I cooked a plan chicken breast and shredded that with little white rice(not brown too much fiber for dogs so by the last days he had a 1/2 cup food consisting of broth,chix breast,white rice,pumpkin and bene-bac and I warmed it up )At the end of 7 days his stool is thickening from the previous every 30 minute orange squirts(prior to adding the pumpkin).He is resting for 3 hours or more at a time and without hearing his stomach distress sounds of gurgling and rumbling,the gleam is back in his once dull eyes and he is barking at cars again. I also purchased the Propectalin Anti-Diarrheal gel for dogs/cats but it has yet to arrive and I am and I am thankful that I might not need it this time around but will keep product because of its high reviews and trying to get him to take a hidden 1/2 Imodium tablet when he was refusing to eat anything for the first 2 days was daunting until the rice water alone.

It was just tall enough for him to stand on but all he would do is smell and look at the netting he seemed very focused on the smell and the label for some reason. I put him on it numerous times and told him to lay down and he just looked very uncomfortable I think it's a texture thing with the fabric with him he finds it scratchy. I'll put him in it for a few minutes and then he'll go lay on the cement in the heat in the Sun for a few minutes and then go in the shadows I've even tried putting half the bed in the Sun and have to bed in the shade I actually got him one day to lay in it for a couple hours. The first time I tried to show it to him I said it up against one of the cushioned outdoor chairs he just used it like a staircase to get up on one of the chairs LOL. I've now put a blanket on it and he seems to tolerate it better.

I found another use for it since my dog does not like the feel of the netting. It's a wonderful flat bird feeder for those birds that are ground feeders like doves sparrows quals and even the finches Etc. I bought a bunch of feeders on here on Amazon and I started getting more and more birds it was becoming crazy all the babies were coming to my yard many of them we're finches and they were affected from that disease they caught last year so they could not fly well yet due to lack of local food where they can still be safe where they hide. This feeder is amazing I just cover it with all kinds of seeds and under it I cover it with seeds. All this activity from Birds has gotten the attention from Hawks that have literally tried to fly through my yard and when they were scared they flew off in a panic and one of them killed themselves it was so sad. So since using this as a bird feeder they just hide underneath it it's perfect and this will allow the baby's to have cover without having to fly and possibly get killed",My dog hates it but it makes a wonderful bird feeder for ground feeders,1495670400,"{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' Green'}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+B9KOc5eL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sIIvs5xwL._SY88.jpg']"

Rawhides scare me, kongs require effort and increased calories and I had heard good things about Nylabones. My dog will not touch the originals and will occasionally chew on the chocolate one for a couple of minutes. I wouldn't get the value pack before confirming that my dog A. likes Nylabones and B. likes the originals. If you're insistent on getting these and you have a chewer, I would consider going a size up.

I ended up getting a naturally shed deer antler - they cost a little more but last a really long time, don't get dirty like nylabones, are odorless and are actual bones so the vast majority of dogs like them. If you can find the ones that are cut through the middle so they expose more marrow - your dog will probably be entertained for longer periods of time. Bully sticks are also pretty much a guaranteed hit, although my boyfriend calls them butt sticks because of the terrible smell. Comment if you find something else that works. :)

Update: While the nylabone still isn't his favorite - He does chew the chocolate one a little longer after I took it away and pretended that it was my phone a few different times.

I could have used my CritterTrail tubes, as they work with the loft and the Critter Universe cage, but I didn't have enough extra ones. SO, I had the loft sitting on its side on the table while I was working on the cage. My mouse also was playing on the table. She went inside the loft and was having a grand time in there, so I put it in her cage on its side and she uses it for a sleep house. It just has the one round hole opening (with the lid on) and she loves it. I put nesting material in there and she makes a cozy bed. So, although I didn't use this the way I planned, my mouse had other plans for it. I'm happy and she's happy.

By the way, the tubes do connect to the side portals on the CritterTrail (by Super Pet) cage and they connect to CritterTrail tubes. These Habitrail tubes are called Mini, because they are narrower than the regular Habitrail tubes. (The openings are the same size, but then it narrows.)

My dogs who are around 20 lbs. each don't find it that easy to walk up.  The angle up to my SUV is high and they don't feel secure enough to walk up it without me pulling them for security.

I only rated it 3 stars because of the manufacturer's lack of attention to details. First, the assembly instructions are pictorial only, no actual instructions. One of the back pieces, labeled ""C"" in one pic isn't identified in the actual step it is assembled in. The problem lies in the fact the item is identified by the front side of it but in the assembly step it is seen only from the back so it isn't  immediately recognized as the same part. It does take two people to assemble this so make sure you have some help. Four of the screws identified as M3-16 (4 pieces), used to secure the top back piece to the roof and center brace, are too short. I had to go to the hardware store and purchase M6-20's to finish the assembly.

Where I'm most disappointed is the construction of the two front doors and the latches that are supposed to secure those doors. The doors are made in such a way as to create too much space between the door and the center post of the frame when closed. As a result, the latch used to secure the right door doesn't reach all the way to the receiver portion of the latch. I've come into the room a few times now to see the right door completely open because the rabbit bumped the door and opened it. The left door latch is misaligned and the door has to be lifted slightly in order to latch the door. The screws used to attach the latches to the doors were stripped and difficult to remove so I could realign the latches for proper closure.

The use of asphalt shingle for the roof is okay but using the same material on the ramp wasn't a good choice. The rabbit's activity up and down the ramp loosens the particles of asphalt and creates a mess as well as something we don't want the rabbit to be eating.

I wouldn't recommend this hutch for outdoor use. It is a nice looking hutch but plan on making some improvements in order to keep your critter secure and safe. Overall I'd say it is over priced for the quality of the workmanship. Still, once you make the latches more secure and purchase 35 cents worth of screws you will have a nice hutch your critter will enjoy.",Decent hutch but not crafted well,1387324800,"{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' Glazed Pine', 'Style:': ' Rabbit Hutch with Sloped Roof'}",

It's the perfect size for a small female cat or for any cat who loves perching. As with all products, each cat is different and placement of product in the home can also effect it's desirability.

Originally given 3 stars for below:

Like with any product designed and intended for animals you take a chance. This should be included with the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post. It should not be sold separately unless they improve the design.

By improve the design I mean the way this perch fastens to the post. It slides on and two plastic wing clips are what keep it from sliding off. One of the clips didn't even move for me. This piece should be fastened with screws, not plastic clips.

The dilemma with the cushion is easily fixable. Find someone to sew you a slip cover cushion. This would give you control over how thick the padding is also. However, the designers should have already thought of this. A tight slip cover makes more sense than velcro. It would still be washable and it would actually be more convenient.

As far as padding thickness. Cats don't really care about padding. They would be content with just the perch, which is a fine stable piece of wood..so long as they don't slide off the product.

As with size, the perch is a fair size. Cats tend to lay on just about anything and be comfortable, regardless of size.

Overall, I'd say purchase this on sale. I would have still gotten it at $40 but it's more a bargain at half the price. Especially since it needs some adjusting.",Cat loves it.,1369267200,,

The trick is to get just enough glue into the nail to make it stick, but not so much it overflows and contacts the skin or the retraction area.  Med claws need 1 drop, large nails need 1.5 drops of glue.  (start the 2nd drop but skim it off at the rim).  I squeeze the nails after they are in place, and put my own finger where the glue would ouze out of the top.  The glue must NOT come into contact with your pet's fur or he will chew them.  Catching it before hand will make wearing them easier. They've cut back to 2 tubes of glue in a package, and that is not enough.  3 was too much.

1276972,5,6,True,"01 31, 2017",A26S0JQRE86CT4,B009B83V76,P. Posey,"I had reservations about buying this litter box because I saw a lot of complaints about it leaking pee.  I have a cat that stands to pee and has managed to pee outside of every other litter box I've gotten her (except for the Catit Jumbo hooded litter box). So I was very scared that this would be a problem but I haven't had any issues. I always make sure to close the little drawer on the bottom to prevent leaking and I leave a trash bag under the box in case it ever does leak (which is more out of habit because I typically have them taped to the walls and everything as a safety net for my cat that stands to pee) but I haven't had any issues with leaking.  I was also concerned with it being too small because I have a maine coon and a Siberian that are each 15lbs, but they use it without any problems.

I saw the reviews that said it was large but I was more surprised with how high the box was off the ground.  I have a senior cat that had difficulty getting in it but I put a plastic stool in front and he gets in and out without a problem now.  It also does a better job of containing litter scatter than other litter boxes I've had.

I also can't say enough about the liners and how easy it is to clean.  I used traditional liners before and my cats didn't do so well with them but they do fine with this system.  They are difficult to buy through prime and fairly pricey though, so keep that in mind. I love being able to turn the handle every day, have the clumps isolated in the waste bin, and not have to stick my head down there and sift through anything. I also think because of that is smells less than my traditional litter boxes.

I also saw some reviews that said the grate was an issue in the sifting mechanism.  While occasionally a tiny piece here and there will get stuck, it's never actually hindered the functionality of the design.  I make sure that I don't sift it right after my cat uses it because it doesn't give the litter time to clump/dry out any moisture.  I think that it's the moisture that causes it to adhere to the grate. I also move the handle very slowly so it doesn't break the clumps apart and cause it to stick.

Lastly, I love that I use half the litter I was using.  It takes a half a box of the 15 lb. lightweight clump & seal cat litter to fill it to the line.  I was using an entire box every time I changed litter before.

I have 3 cats and change the bags out every week and I wash & spray it down with an enzyme cleaner monthly and it keeps it smelling fresh and the grate working optimally.",Great system but it does require attention to detail,1485820800,{'Color:': ' Tan'},

It is hard to predict which toys a cat will use or not, and this is one that was a dud as far as Andy and Dougy, my two Persians, were concerned. They are well-made, however. If the cat won't play with them, I bet your dog will.

I ""re-purposed"" them in my utensil drawer. The utensil holders are shorter than the drawer, and always slipped toward the back when I closed the drawer. I needed something to keep this from happening. I placed the toys behind the utensil holders, and they worked just fine for that duty. That's where they are to this day!

If they were sold for this purpose, I'd rate them five stars.

It has a milder smell and more pleasant to me that is not as pungent as her regular grain-free food from Natural Balance. The circular kibbles are small and of a nice size for my small dog to eat. The first two listed ingredients are lamb and chicken meal, followed by chickpeas and split peas, which appear to be the good source of the 32% high protein content. Furthermore, I like that it has no grain, corn or wheat fillers, which don't fill her up are just gonna make her poop more.

I transitioned her into her new food over a couple of days by slowly and increasingly replacing her old kibbles with the new ones. She doesn't seem to have a digestive problem with the new food. So far so good. This food claims to have a lower glycemic content but I haven't noticed anything different in my dog. So I'm not sure how it works out benefit wise.

All in all, this dog food seems like a quality product. I like that it's grain free, wheat free and corn free, and contains a high protein content from meat and peas.

Price,"This fence has been very convenient and is great if your yard isn't so small on the sides that you can't make your enclosed circle big enough without overlapping your neighbor's property.  I admit that after training my two dogs, I bumped up the signal a little to give them more room in the back despite the overlap.  It hasn't been a problem yet since the dogs mostly stay in the back and haven't noticed that they can get a few feet into the neighbors yards at two locations.  I am refraining from giving this device five stars for two reasons.  One is that the enclosed perimeter isn't actually a perfect circle.  There is an odd notch cut in out of it in one corner of my yard.  I am not sure what causes that but I am guessing that some metal in my house or maybe the grill or metal table on my back patio are interfering with the signal somehow.  The second reason is that I had to buy an extra collar for my second dog and there is a three or four foot difference between where the two collars activate, meaning I have to keep one of my dogs much further inside the yard once you take ~4 feet off the radius of the circle.  One of my dogs doesn't like to be out alone too much anyhow, so I put the collar with the shorter radius on him and it hasn't been too much of a problem.

This faux fur stuff is NOTHING like carpet and not worth the cheap price. My cats occasionally jump on it and lay down on it for a short time. They are adults at 11 and 18 lbs and even the smallest one hardly fits in the top 'beds'. I would return this item if I could and buy a more expensive tree made of carpet with larger cat beds.

Pros: It is stable, does not wobble when in a corner. We have been tightening it weekly as the directions suggest. Building directions were simplistic but did the trick. Product comes with all the tools necessary to build it, but you may find it helpful to use your own better tools. It is cheap, tall, has scratching posts, and seems sturdy.
Cons: The cat beds are shallow and tight for my adult, average sized, semi-overweight cats of 11-18 lbs. The cats pictured seem like they're either kittens, or photo-shopped... There is zero padding in the cat beds. None of the surfaces on this tree are large enough for an average size cat to comfortably lie down and forget stretching out. My cats are very active and have gone through 2 previous cheap carpeted cat trees - 2 weeks they are showing little to no interest in this tree. I don't think they like the faux-fur covering - possibly just a preference. There are bolts that hang down under the levels. Not crazy about this for potential injury reasons. On top of the beds, the bolts are exposed, so the cats are basically laying on the head of the bolts (if they had room to really lay down).

I will probably keep this tree - mostly because of the hassle of taking it apart and shipping it back seems too daunting. I'd highly recommend spending a bit more and getting a higher quality tree. But if this is your budget, this is probably a decent tree that will last.","Not impressed, but may be worth the low price tag.",1391385600,"{'Size:': ' 40""(L)X33""(W)X80""(H)', 'Color:': ' Beige'}",

She usually rips off most of the tennis-ball fuzz, leaving a goofy-looking rubber football. But she LOVES this thing. We've designated it as an ""outdoor-only"" toy (because she has too many toys), and it's the first thing she grabs when she walks out the door. It's more important to her than actually going to the bathroom. She gets very sad when she can't find the toy (when she's played with the kids, or drops it to go after a rabbit, and then can't find it when she comes back). She lost one over the winter in the snow, and we (she) didn't find it until spring. She was ecstatic. She brings it to the back door and knows to drop it before she comes inside, though sometimes she tries to sneak it in.

We've been through a few of these over the years, buying a new one when an old one gets lost, or when it finally bites the dust. (We foster animals, and an especially gregarious pit bull puppy helped shred one to bits - but they had a blast playing with all the smaller pieces. If they hadn't played tug-of-war, I don't think the whole ball would have come apart.)

For all those who are bummed about the fuzzy stuff...that's life. The dogs love to ""skin"" what they eat or play with. The ball underneath is still perfectly fine for playing with, if a bit slobbery by the time she brings it back to you to throw again.

I buy the occasional bale of straw for my four chickens to use in their nest boxes. I have no suitable outdoor storage for it, and I had kludged together a sort of platform from PVC drain pipe, a big square of board, and some tarps. The mice loved it. Best playhouse ever. Didn't stay dry either. Wound up wasting a ton of it, although the chickens enjoyed eating the mice as they ran from the straw bale. Win for the chickens. Fail for me.

I needed another bale of straw before I had figured out what to do for storage. So I put it on the front porch temporarily. Not only did the chickens think that was spectacular, my dog, Augie, did, too. Jerkface dog and sassy chickens pulled a flake off and made it snow straw. Anticipating the Full Straw Bale Explosion that was surely coming, I went shopping. I bought a patio storage box to use for storage, if that plan succeeds, but in the meantime I desperately needed something to keep the marauders out of it. Surely there must be something for storing a single bale of hay or straw.

Tah dah!

I ordered it Nov 30th and it was here the next day. Holy cow! Normal 2 day Prime shipping, too. What minor miracle was that?

Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package. I really didn't expect it to be quite as substatial and nice. Some of the reviews made it sound like it was sort of cheesily made. I, personally, think the quality is very good at a reasonable price. But then again...I was desperate. ;)

Like I say, I have only had it a couple of days. Put the exploding straw bale in it last night, much to Augie's disappointment. The chickens also seemed a little disappointed, but hey, it's MY porch. Most of the bale fit in the bag. It's a small bale. Not the whopper bales. I think I might have been a little hard pressed to get the whole bale in there, but since the baling twine had been sprung, it's hard to say for sure.  I had used one flake in the chicken coop and the dog and chickens murdered a second flake. So not quite a full bale. I ~think~ a full small bale will fit, but I can't prove it just yet. Zipped right up.

Likes:
- Nice looking bag. The colors are great.
- Holds as much straw as I need.
- Seems to be well made. Time will tell. I currently see no issues with fabric, stitching, etc. Feels plenty sturdy to me.
- Easy to lift. Placement of handles is good, at least for me. I am 5' 6"" with the upper body strength of a pipe cleaner. I was able to pick it up and toss it around with no issues. A lot easier to move around in the bag than it is by hauling on the baling twine. Great for transporting.
- Contains the mess of an open bale of straw. (duh)

Dislikes:
- I would have preferred a metal zipper, in theory. That might actually be prone to rust/corrosion and weather, so I might actually NOT be such a great idea. However, the zipper feels a little on the flimsy side to me. Mostly the actually pull-tab part. As I noted above, though, I had no problems with zippering it up. Worked smoothly. I am just a little worried about durability.

The Unknowns:
- The meaning of life.
- Whether or not it will do a decent job of keeping the bale reasonably dry. I do get some rain blown onto the porch from time to time (Thank you, Oregon). While the bag is positioned on the driest portions of my porch, it is likely to get a little wet.
- The zipper longevity, as noted above.
- The overall quality in terms of how long it will hold up. Some reviews mentioned seams coming apart and such. First impression is good. We shall see about longterm.

Overall, I really like this bag and if it proves to be pretty reliable I may order a second one at some point. It would be nice to buy a couple of bales at a time and not have to worry about straw all over the bedrug of my truck, storage, etc. I would recommend this bag.",Nice bag!,1480636800,"{'Size:': ' 44"" x 22"" x 18""', 'Color:': ' Royal Blue'}",

We bring her in at night to mingle with the family and keep her warm. We didn't want her to have to stay outside 24/7, but she couldn't keep going up/down the stairs.

These bones work great! We can see the difference. I don't know if the glucosamine pills would work even better, but that isn't as convenient (I have to pry her jaw open and force her to swallow) so these bones really saved us!",They work!,1332460800,,

He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )
So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.
So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!
Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.
( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )",Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!,1329868800,,

Pro:

+ Clearest, finest quality acrylic tank for this price. Having seen many, this is the reason to buy the tank and put up with minor irritations. 99% of the time you're looking at your fish.
+ Filter works very efficiently and quietly, excellent for a tank this size.
+ Lighting is the best I've seen for a tank this size. Very bright, sufficient for some plants, far superior to the incandescent junk on tanks at this price. Bulb replaceable.
+ Hood has opening high and large enough to put in your own filter if you want to replace the built in.

Negatives:

- Area to feed fish is minute. Don't even think about autofeeders unless cover is off. Workable, just not simple.
- Cover very difficult to pry open to feed - stick a tab you can get at a hardware store and you're done.
- Filter can be very quirky to get to work. Instructions poor on how to troubleshoot. Possibility of burning out motor if you don't get it right quickly.
- While beautiful acrylic, reflects a great deal. Bettas may flare at their reflection for days with the light on.
- Light will sometimes be quirky but I've found if you wait for an extra second or two, the light will flicker on, just need to wait a little longer.

Maintenance: On ANY tank this size you'll need to take off the cover. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar. It's a small opening so what can you expect? The only challenge here is that the top is heavier and, IMHO, much better built. But since the filter is on top of the tank area, it can get in the way and needs to be pulled out too. That inconvenience is certainly there but you have to ask whether this filter system is better than a Whisper 3i, which it may be (I add a 10gallon air pump for that one.) If you don't want the filter, break the plastic bar in the middle and you've got the great opening you crave. Air hoses can be sneaked out the small space in the back of the tank.

Overall this tank is absolutely as good as it gets at this size and price. People who think this tank is the worst either (a) paid much more than $40-45 or (b) have never been to Petco and purchased their $40 tanks, which are abysmal. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best at this price? Yes. If you've got $60-100 to spend, there are better designed tanks. Regarding the 1 star reviewers, they point out the same flaws that I do but decide if you really think that it's that devastating (e.g. a spinning wheel you don't need to replace whose effectiveness is questionable.)","Best value for price, minor limitations",1336521600,{'Size:': ' 3-Gallon'},

Some words of wisdom learned the hard way, be consistent, I put this in with every meal, he eats twice a day, sometimes more, he was a pellet fed cat for years which lead to the onset of diabetes as cats cannot process things like a dog can, cats have an extremely sensitive system that unlike a dog who can scavenge and dig in the trash and be fine, a cat seemingly cannot...

I have only had it for a few days now, but it is GREAT!  I have a 7 month old kitten and a 13 yo cat.  The kitten is the one who loves to drink out of the bathroom lavatory, so I thought the fountain would be good to try.  Well, she loves it!  She drinks often and is fascinated by the running water.  She has not made a mess by playing in it though.  My older cat just drank from it (cautiously) today.  I am using inexpensive bottled drinking water because my water forms crystals on my humidifier filters.  I bought the 50 oz reservoir which is ""a must"" to avoid refilling often and to prevent the motor burning out because of lack of water.  I also bought the cleaning brushes after reading other reviews.  Be cautious about  negative reviews --- I have often found many to be due to user error after I receive my own product to try.

I tried walking her with a loose choke chain, but she became very anxious, especially after we had a tug of war to decide who was walking whom (she won that round).
As soon as I put the Gentle Leader collar on her, she calmed down and sat quietly while I slipped it on. Its much gentler and more humane than choke chains or prong collars. And her good behavior started immediately. On our next walk there was no leash pulling or surging ahead. Teaching her to heel was easy. No yanking or yelling. A lot less stressful for both of us.

I had several of these filters on different size tanks.  I was using them on my growth tanks (where I put juvenile fish that aren't ready to fend for themselves with bigger fish yet).  Within 9 months I had two of these filters fail and experienced 100% FISH LOSS in the tanks they were installed on.

After some post failure analysis (I do failure analysis for a living), it looks like the problem with this filter is where the pump is placed in the filter box.  Both of the failures I had were after brief power outages and the pumps did not re-prime.  The pumps ran dry until they over heated and the impeller seized.  Without the recirculation of water all of the fish in the tank slowly suffocated.

A better design for this filter would be to submerse the pump in the tank in line with the intake tube so that re-priming is not an issue.  This would also allow the tank's water to keep the pump cool at all times.

I really liked everything about these filters except for their failure prone pump placement.  There are other power filters on the market that don't seem to have the pump priming problem, but I haven't found one that allows the media options that this AquaClear filter does.

Maybe the makers of the AquaClear can fix this pump issue.  If they did they would have the best power filter product in the market by far.",PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY ONE OF THESE FILTERS,1384992000,"{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging', 'Style:': ' 30: 10 to 30 US Gallons'}",

I've used green tea and hinikoi wood cat litters (by the same company) but the prices went up. I have used crystal cat litter in the past but the less expensive crystal cat litters have sharp crystals that get everywhere and allow urine to pass through them to pool on the bottom of the litter box.

So...I sucked it up, forked out the money, and bought the Litter Pearls. These are not completely dustless but they do track less. I still have to use litter track mats but the outside-of-box litter debris is much reduced. I have two ""excavators,"" one of which has very long hair. Less litter gets trapped in their paws. Also, they ABSORB urine as it trickles down. If the litter boxes are stirred up every day, there are no issues with clumping & pooling. Odor is much less. A little Arm & Hammer litter deodorizer takes care of the rest. And yes, it does last a long time...at least 2 weeks, which is saying something, because I have 3 cats. Finally, what does manage to get out of the litter box isn't razor sharp and if it's stepped on, it breaks into tiny dry pieces that are easily vacuumed up.

Interestingly, these will dissolve in hot water. Out of curiosity and because I wanted to feel better about not using a more ""earth friendly"" litter, I ran some hot water over a few crystals and they dissolved. I imagine cool water would do the same thing, just much more slowly.","Much better than clay, tea, or wood.

But I've learned to periodically hide them and rotate which ones are out because he bores of each pretty quickly. But NOT this Cat Dancer toy. Such a simple thing and yet Nova goes bonkers for it. It's nearly the only toy I use to play with him anymore and he often will drag it around the house with one end, catch the other end moving, and leap after it, in essence learning to play with it himself.

Many people comment their wonder at how such a cheap, simple toy could be so miraculously enticing to cats. I think it's because if you bounce it right, with the wire, it moves like a butterfly or bug, and you can even increase this effect by erratically bobbing it. Nova goes crazy when I do this and it's definitely the most entertaining toy others like to watch us play with. Even beats the laser pointer, which he loves too.

I can't recommend this little product highly enough. I've already bought two more so I have them at the ready as he's nearly chewed through most of the cardboard on the first one I bought him. He is a chewer, but even still the first one lasted about 2 months of constant play and use and chewing. For the price, that's fine by me!

My aquarium is well established (over 10 years) 125 gallon 72 with approximately 75# of live rock. For lighting I have 3 Radion XR15W Pros. The cyano problem started after moving to the LEDs 6 months prior. I run 6 Hydor Koriala power heads on a wave maker. I was using a Phosban reactor 550 with chemipure and a 150 with GFO. Both fresh. I also have a reef octopus HOT skimmer.

The tank has a wide variety of corals including softies, SPS and LPS. The star polyps and zoos were suffering the most so I decided to give this product a try. For fish, the tank has the basic reef fish including a tang, some chromus, 6 line, etc. For inverts it has skunk cleaner shrimp, snails, crabs, harlequin shrimp, some brittle starts, a 12 sebae, a 6 sebae, etc. I also had 10 year old 6 crocea and 3 smaller clams (derasa, squamosal, maxima) varying in age from 18 months to 5 years. The clams responded very well to the LEDs whereas some of the other corals seemed to retract/burn.

I followed the Chemiclean directions closely including turning off all chemical filtration and running a high volume air pump with three stones spread throughout the tank. My skimmer immediately went nuts, requiring significant adjustment but it stayed running. After around 24 hours I noticed the anemones were looking bad and trying to move. It was getting worse over the next 12 hours so I turned back on my ChemiPure and GFO, did a 25% water change, and the anemones settled back in. All of the other animals looked fine. After two weeks, I started noticing all of the clams looking stressed. After a few more days my crocea spawned. I added a mechanical HOT filter to capture the goo before it could cause problems. Over the next month, my clams all started dying. None of the other animals have been affected.

The color of the print I don't mind, it's the single layer of fleece.  I was looking forward to that inner wooly looking layer.  This is just one single layer.  Very thin.  The clips are plastic and the belts that hang it are made of like thin nylon, like an extra thin cat collar.  I don't expect it to last long and the hanging belts seem like they can be chewed through extremely easily.

Over all my rats enjoy it and it is decent for the price.  I paid just over $5.  However, I didn't get anything like what is shown in the picture.  For that it only gets 3 stars.

UPDATE:
I'm bumping this to 5 stars.  It's a bit pricey for what it is.  For those of you who have rats or other smaller critters who like to chew this type of thing to death, I highly suggest a sewing machine.  I have no idea how to sew, but a few You Tube videos later and I was making things like this and liners for my cage on my own.  They aren't perfect, but they're a lot cheaper!  Anyways, the reason I bumped this to a 5 is because the product description has been updated to reflect that colors vary and it is no longer advertising double fleece layers.  Surprisingly, my rats did not chew this apart.  They usually make Swiss cheese out of fleece, but they left this alone.  Since it is only one layer it was easy to rinse out when they inevitably pee in it.  Air dries quickly.  This is a keeper.",My rats enjoyed this! 2 or 3 Medium size rats could easily snuggle inside.,1354060800,,

Frontline itself is a great product.  Someone mentioned it doesn't take care of the whole problem.  It does, but depending on how bad the fleas are, sometimes it takes longer.  If you put this on before the first sign, or at the first sign, you'll notice the difference right away.  However if you're pretty infested, as fleas spread so darn quick, it sometimes takes a month or two of continued use due to the fleas being everywhere and re-habiting your pet.

142171,5,,True,"05 20, 2014",A32918SASHEJTD,B0002CH1BW,LGR,"This toy was a miracle for my 8 week old puggle.  My husband and I are crate training and although he was fine in the crate with the door open, as soon as that door closed my puppy would cry, cry cry. I knew he came from an active area so my first thought was loneliness...enter this toy.  When I received it, I turned the heart on, put it inside the toy, put the toy on my lap, and put the puppy on my lap with the toy.  He slumped right over it so his chest was on top of where the heart was beating and went to sleep within 30 seconds.  Deep enough to snore.  That made me very hopeful for the night, and he has not barked, cried or whined in his crate one night since.  He snuggles right in with the toy and goes to sleep.  Sad puppy problem solved.

My 5 star rating is for the toy itself and how well it worked for me.  However, some things to note:  most importantly, the batteries that come with it are terrible.  When I put them in, the heart made a ticking sound but didn't vibrate.  I was very disappointed, thinking I had been mislead in what the toy was supposed to do.  I changed out the generic batteries that came with it for some fresh new ones and the heart instantly began to ""beat"" and tick as advertised.  I keep a lot of batteries around, just in case, as I don't want his toy to ""die"" while he's sleeping with it (I want him to sleep peacefully, not be traumatized by sleeping with something that dies in his crate).  I've had it just about one week and the batteries are still going strong, but I do turn it off during the day and remove it from his playthings, making it strictly a ""bedtime"" companion, instead of an all day toy.  Also, I have not used the heat warmer, and he still loves it.  I wanted to see how he did without the warmer before I got into a costly cycle of having to keep buying those 24 hour heat warmers that you might be able to stretch out into 2 days, or something else that you heat up manually (like a bean bag), that will cool before the night is over.  So by all means, try the heat warmer if you want to, but I opted out of it and he loves it still.

Also, he's chewed the tail, ears, nose...shook it around (on those occasions where I forgot to remove it from his crate and it became a ""regular"" toy, or didn't move it far enough out of reach) and he's roughed it up...it's still in fine shape.  It seems very durable, although I was convinced he would have at least pulled the tongue off of it within the first day or two, but nope, still 100% intact.

I LOVE the Fluval filter... it's worked consistently and wonderfully for me for quite some time and I've not found any other filter that I've experienced or think would work as well.

The Fluval 304 has 4 filtration stages, the first of which is these foam filter blocks.  BEWARE... the are sold in packages of two, but the 304 (and 305) filters require FOUR of these blocks.  In other words, if you want to completely replace the foam filtration stage, you have to get TWO packages.

That being said, the filter works great for me and my aquarium needs only occasional maintenance.  I know that there are knock-off products out there, and I've tried some in the past, but the quality of the material hasn't been the same in the ones I've tried.  Since the key to making the Fluval filter work is to ensure that the water passes through each filtration stage, it's important that this foam filter block fit properly and maintain its shape.  I've had other knock-off products that lose their shape, which disrupts the function of the filter.

What an eye-opener!  The ammonia levels were a little random and would sometimes spike and begin turning the sensor a light green even after only a day.  This sensor has helped me always know when to do water changes beyond my scheduled maintenance so my little betta stays happy.  Since getting this sensor several weeks ago, I've noticed a marked improvement in his behavior.  He is constantly active, building bubble nests, and generally showing some attitude.  This has given me peace of mind and helped me provide better maintenance for my betta when he needs it.  It is also only 1.5"" x 3"" so it is not obtrusive and it is easy to install.

Most everything about the Guardian GSE EXT II appears to be high quality, except it arrived missing a crucial screw that holds the canopy to the handle.  Another MAJOR problem occurred when I was trying to fix the front wheel after testing the swivel mode.  The knob has some kind of spring mechanism inside, and it literally flew apart and broke when I turned it.  I could not fix it.  So, two major problems right out of the box (neither of which anyone buying a $200 stroller should expect).  Beyond that, I felt there were a few design issues.  First, I wish the zip up/over mesh front simply zipped off altogether.  Dogs have nails, and when this is not zipped closed, the mesh just puddles onto the front of the cabin floor.  It's just asking to get snagged on your pet's nails.  And since it cannot be removed, that means it's not a ""part"" that can be ordered for replacement.  It's attached to ALL of the other fabric on the stroller -- though it can be folded out and over the front support bar of the cabin.  But again, it's just kinda asking to get snagged or ripped there, and it doesn't look ideal when folded out and over.  Not a good thing.  Another design issue that bothered me was the fact that the wheel can only be fixed to a stationary position that juts out from the front of the stroller.  When you put it in swivel mode, the wheel swivels 180 degrees toward the back, and it is then UNDER the stroller as you go forward (out of the way).  In my opinion, it would be nice to be able to lock it that way as well.  In an idea world, I also would have liked a thicker removable pad for the cabin floor (with a removable waterproof cover).  The pad that comes with it is thin, and I do not feel it's soft enough.  So, if you get this and your pet likes a cushion-y surface to sit/lay on, you will have to go to the trouble of sourcing an additional pad that will fit the cabin.  At this price point, that's something I'd rather not be left to deal with.  I'd even be happy if they offered a correct size thicker pad as an accessory.  Lastly, I would have benefited from some instructions on use in addition to the assembly instructions.  It took me a good while to figure out how to close the stroller, and you really shouldn't have to risk breaking something via trial and error because of such a simple oversight.  I also didn't know the tires would come deflated -- so you better have a pump around if you plan to use the stroller right away.

On the positive side, this is a beautiful stroller.  The steel blue color is great looking, and I loved the reflective stripes down the side.  Everything looks to be high quality.  This stroller looks expensive, and it's very solid.  If it wasn't for the issues I mentioned above, I would easily give it 5 stars.  I regret that I could only go with 3 given my experience.

For me, the biggest negative (other than the defects in the one we received) is the lack of removable mesh on the front.  The biggest positive is the solid build quality and nice fabric.","High quality overall, but with a few issues...",1382572800,{'Color:': ' Sage Green'},

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.

I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference and, as an added bonus, I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like it! My only quibble with the senior formulation of this great food is that it is very dry - I really do recommend that you add at least a touch of a good oil and water to it to prevent dry skin - dogs get most of their hydration from food.",An Excellent Food,1189209600,,

If you are looking for a durable (glass!), good looking, functional heater, this is a perfect choice for you. It works like a charm, I have it set in my turtle tank at around 78 degrees, and that's exactly where it stays at. However, here are a few things I didn't expect:
-If you are like me and have a turtle aquarium that is not full all the way, be careful with this heater! It is a very tall heater, and the instructions don't allow you to tilt or angle it at all. The minimum fill line is literally at the very top of the heater in this picture, just below the plastic cap on top. If you have a fish tank, this is perfect. But be careful with other reptiles that only have a half full tank! I have it on my 10 gallon take for my hatchling painted turtle, and I have to tilt the heck out of it to make it work. I know the box says no tilting of any sort, but I've read some information that it is just a liability thing from the company, like if the seal on top breaks underwater or something. Telling the truth, it should be a okay if you tilt it, it still works fine for me! But i do wish I would have known that it is preferred to be straight up and down.
-*YOU MUST HAVE A GFCI OUTLET FOR IT!* You know, those little outlets in your bathroom with reset and test button on them that no one really knows what they do. But what they do, is save your animal's life! If something goes wrong in this heater, it would essentially become a wire that's linking your outlet to the water in the tank. And as we know, water and electricity and living things don't mix. All the people that complain that a heater killed their animals, didn't have it plugged in a GFCI. (They cut off overflow electricity when it senses it, so when something goes wrong you don't fry your animals). So yeah, buy one if you don't have one! They're like 6$ at a local harbor freight of mine, and super easy to change.
-it is SUPER hard to read the temperature you are setting. They are in incriminates of 4, but in squares of 2 that go over and up, if that makes sense. I still don't understand the scale it goes up by really... So be sure to have a thermometer to see what you set it at! I really can't explain it very good, it's just super hard to understand. Trust me.

As I said before, this heater works fantastic. Keeps my turtle nice and warm, and at a constant temperature. although I do have to break some rules to tilt it 45 degrees to get close to the minimum water level line, it does still work. if you have a full fish aquarium, this is perfect. If you have a turtle tank or something of the sort, be very careful!

Fit - after reading some of the other reviews on how it ran, I ordered a medium for my Boxer and it's almost a perfect fit.  The leg holes were a tiny bit tight, but all I had to do was stretch them out (I stretched until I heard some of the seams pop) by hand and that solved that problem.  I have left him, on cold days, in his coat all day long, and I have never noticed it rubbing him around the legs or around the neck.

Material - this is what I would consider a lighter weight coat.  I wish they made this same design in a heavier material.  But, it is thick enough to help him keep warm and that was the whole intention of me buying him a coat.  The material is soft and it machine washes, and I've dried it in the dryer and there has been no shrinkage.",and this one works the best hands down,1420761600,"{'Size:': ' m', 'Color:': ' Granite Gray'}",

I squeeked the eggs, and showed him me putting it in the platypus. At first he just played with the platypus squeeking the eggs through it. He didn't get it. I took something familiar, the squirrel from the hide a squirrel, and put it in the platypus with its tail sticking out so it's obvious. He pulled it out like he would with the plush tree stump. I praise, and with a couple of more trys I change it to the egg. I don't put the egg all the way in at first. When he pulled the egg, I praised him and gradually put the eggs deeper into the toy.
Now he knows how it works and can pull all the eggs out in seconds.(I then get my dog to fetch all the eggs so I can fill it up for him again)

It's now really a challenge for him, but he has fun playing with it, which is the point. He loves squeeking the eggs, and not really interested in the platypus shell. He did chew up one egg with his molars, but good thing the toy come with two extra eggs.

On the downside, I suspect that the praising when pulling the eggs out of the toy taught him to pull all the stuffing out of the other regular toys he has. He wasn't really into that before, and now he pulls out the stuffings with much excitement and enthusiasm. If your dog alraedy enjoys that then the platypus toy give him an alternative.
Another thing is that the stitchings on the opening on the toy's stomach has stretched, almost about to pop out, but it's not really noticable so I don't really care.

This not only extends the life of the pump, but also prevents the pump from heating the air excessively, which can raise the tank's water temperature during hot summer weather.  One thing I noticed after a few weeks of operations was that the rubber feet on the end of the support legs were beginning to rub off and leave a black residue on the tabletop next to my tank where the pump was sitting atop.  I had an extra mouse pad from my computer that I wasn't using, so I stuck it under the pump to make sure the tabletop wasn't damaged.  While the pump was very quite before, after I put the pad beneath it, I cannot hear it at all.  I don't have great hearing, but another brand of pump I was using before was made an humming sound that could be very annoying when reading.

My cat never took to the Drinkwell, and after reading up on it I found several claims, supposedly by vets, that stated if you have a long hair cat or one that has a major aversion to getting wet, the Drinkwells, and any other fountain that can splash or flick water in their face, they will probably not use it. So I looked at this one because it is supposed to be completely splash-proof. And it is!

The two things I like about the Petmate is that a) its motor is completely encased inside the machine, and b) the water runs down a little slide. The motor being inside the fountain, rather than on the bottom like the Drinkwells, means it is much more muffled. Late at night I can hear it pumping when all the TVs and radios are off and everyone is in bed. It is quieter than most aquarium pumps already, but being inside the fountain, then covered up by the addition of water, it is literally whisper quiet. You don't even hear water splashing much since it is actually being funneled down a little ramp, rather than just pumped out into the air to fall inside the bowl like most fountains. I can actually hear my cat drinking over the sound of this machine, which is nice because you are always wondering if your cat is using it enough.

We were weening our cat of a bathtub faucet dependency. Though she is still angry about no more bathwater, she seems to really have taken to the Petmate fountain. It's kind of funny to watch because she seems to want to try and sample water from every square inch of the bowl, starting on the left side and working her way counterclockwise around the bowl. She'll even sniff at the little ramp, though she never drinks directly from that part. I think she's more interested in the bubbles.

The reservoir is the genius part. Instead of wasting a ton of space, they made half the fountain a detachable reservoir that can be filled. I personally clean this fountain once a week, every Sunday, and so far I have not even had to scrub muck out of any corners or crevices. Why? Because there doesn't seem to be many corners or crevices on this machine. Very rounded at every angle. I would have no fear about letting this fountain run for a few weeks without a cleaning if I had to be out of town or soemthing.

The only con I have found so far is that occasionally a gnat or other small bug will land in the water and get stuck on the side without the pump. The water circulates pretty well, but some things like bugs or food crumbs will often end up getting trapped on the side of the ramp where it can't be sucked into the pump. Personally, I think this is a good thing, but it does mean that particles like this may not get caught in the filter. Sure, you want crumbs to get trapped by the filter, but do you really want a rotting bug carcass in there too?

The filters are basic charcoal filters, and personally I don't really think they do much but keep out food crumbs that do get sucked into the pump. We have run it without them, and did so for a little while just to make sure the bathtub water we filled it up with still smelled and tasted like the bathtub faucet. This is how we have been weening the cat off the tub water. Out of nowhere she just really got obsessed with the bathroom faucet after fifteen years.

IF you are looking for a good, affordable pet fountain, then this is probably one of the best bets for cats. It doesn't splash their face, it is really quiet, it has a reservoir, it is very easy to clean, and maintenance and assembly are so basic and simple. It also has replacement parts, unlike most fountains, so if the pump craps out, which eventually all pumps do, you can just replace that rather than buying a whole new fountain. So far, ours has been going strong for a bout a month now and after the first few weeks, and some really bad experiences with our previous Drinkwell, the cat has really taken to this. I highly recommend this over any of the fountains I have seen offered here.",After a month it is a success,1352592000,,

So first time we set this toy up we put treats on the top level and he figured out how to push them down much quicker than expected which was very fun to watch. So now as part of his treat routein atleast a few get dropped into this toy and while he doesn't always go for them right away, eventually later that day we'll see him going after his treats when he is hungry again.

1533933,4,306,False,"12 5, 2014",A1QMN8SJYRREMT,B00JVHSIS4,Dave Cunningham,"A longtime friend, who happens to be a veterinary tech, disdains supermarket pet food as junk (meat byproducts and unhealthy stuff) and recommends the pricier Wellness brand for our cats, available at certain pet stores. Weve used Wellness for many years. I got a 12-pack of Purina Beyond Ocean Whitefish & Spinach Recipe to see how our cats liked it, wondering if it might be a suitable alternative (and they DO like it). Both products are marketed as natural cat food, but Purina is available in supermarkets. A careful side-by-side comparison of ingredients reveals very little difference between the Wellness Turkey and Salmon product and the Purina Ocean Whitefish & Spinach. Both share 19 of the exact same ingredients (see list below).

The Wellness product lists 38 separate ingredients, the Purina product only 30. So what does Wellness offer that Purina does not? Sweet potatoes, squash, zucchini, cranberries, blueberries and ground flaxseed, among a few others. Those all sound wonderful to a health-conscious human, but I doubt they would ever be part of the natural diet of a feline.

Do those additions promote wellness in cats? My online search found data from a Dr. Debra Zoran, DVM, a vet writing in the JAVMA, and as paraphrased, her opinion is that most of the relevant work seems to indicate that the nutrients found specifically in vegetables/fruits aren't digestible by cats, and the nutrients that they need are found in animal tissue (usually muscle or fatty tissue). So the inclusion of these ingredients in their food is not poisonous, but adds indigestible mass that they don't need.

So should we switch to Purina, which doesnt contain all those fruits and veggies? If cost were the only factor, the answer would be no. Purina ""Beyond Natural"" costs about $1.66 per 3 oz. can, Wellness (although pricier than most supermarket cat foods) can be bought by the case on Amazon for a tick under $1 per 3 oz. can. But price is not the only factor.

Some time ago, I also got and reviewed Sheba Premium Cat Food (chicken entre), which our cats also loved, and it does not include fruits and veggies. You can buy that for about 60 cents per 3 oz. can.

Our cats have done well with Wellness brand food for years, but I suspect Sheba and Purina might be a bit better for them because they're more meat, less fruit and veggies. Of the three, Sheba is the least expensive.

FYI: The 19 ingredients that are found in both the Wellness Turkey and Salmon pate and the Purina Beyond Ocean Whitefish & Spinach pate  turkey, liver, whitefish, carrots, guar gum, potassium chloride, taurine, calcium pantothenate, Vitamin E Supplement, choline chloride, folic acid, niacin, Vitamin D-3 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, potassium iodide and biotin.","A look at ingredients, health, price",1417737600,"{'Size:': ' (12) 3 oz.

We were seeing more hair on our clothes after playing with him as it became warmer. My son and daughter were also starting to cough like crazy and we were worried it was due to pet hair (when an air purifier didn't stop the coughing). (The dog was also starting to cough and hack - he licks himself a lot.)

The furminator was just waaaay out of budget. The reviews on this looked good, so I went ahead and purchased it.

First, install the batteries and turn the massager on when brushing the dog. It keeps the dog calmer and seems to prevent the machine from pulling as much hair out. I tried it first without batteries and he really didn't like it AT ALL. He was willing to lie back and was more calm with the massager on.

My Morkie usually looks like a ball of fluff after being groomed. After using this brush, there was definitely less hair on him. The adorable poof was gone :-( (that was yesterday).

He went to the vet today, so I decided to use the deshedder on him again when he came back because dogs tend to shed more when they go to the vet. I think I got more hair out today than I did yesterday and I fear it might be pulling his hair out more than removing loose hair. I say this because he's usually very passive about being groomed, but he's tried to bite this brush when it gets stuck in his hair and then pulls.

I'm using very light strokes. I'm making sure not to press down, but I have no idea how a low to no shed dog can have THIS MUCH loose hair in a 24 hour period! I wish the instructions said how often it could be used.

On the plus side, my children are no longer coughing and neither is the dog, but I'm still keeping an eye on all of them. The dog was starting to look like he needed a haircut, but now he looks neat again.

I think I might only use this once  or twice a week or when I start seeing hair on my clothes. I really don't want a bald morkie.

21 March 2012

Finally received an email back from the company regarding my concerns about the deshedder possibly leaving me with a bald dog. This is NOT intended for low shed dogs, so if you have one, please DO NOT BUY! It WILL make your dog bald.

Though I have never tried one myself, based on the reaction of my dogs when presented with their joint supplement tablets, they are definitely not tasty. I've tried crushing them and adding to their food, breaking up the tablets and mixing with soft food, offering them plain, putting in Pill Pockets, wrapping in cheese, you name it. Two will eat anything that isn't moving, but the other two are another story. I can disguise it if the tablets are crushed up and mixed in with moist food, otherwise they spit it out. It's always a pain in the rear to get these two to take any pills, and the fact that most supplements are the size of quarters doesn't help.

I love that this supplement from Pettura is easy to use, not messy at all, and best of all our four dogs seem to like it. No more picking up slimy, spit out, partially dissolved pills and trying to get them into reluctant puppy tummies. No throwing out grossified tablets thereby wasting a dose. A few pumps into the bowl, give the kibble a stir, and you're done. There isn't any smell that I noticed, which is a vast improvement over other stinky supplements we've tried. No tummy upset in the dogs, either.

While this product is a lot easier to give to our dogs, I wish this brand had green lipped mussel and hyaluronic acid in it, as multiple vets and a lot of research shows that it is beneficial to dogs. The amount of active ingredients is also on the low side, so for older dogs this falls short compared to other highly rated supplements from GlycoFlex or NaturVet. For the same price, I can get a supplement that, while annoying to give, is more complete. I am on the fence about purchasing another bottle when this one is gone. A good plan may be to purchase this supplement again and find an additional green lipped mussel supplement that contains more of what this from Pettura is missing. Maybe by combining the two the two picky-pants dogs we have will take their meds without complaint.",Not bad but not the best out there,1490745600,,

I took so many pictures as soon as I put it on her. All I have to do is fluff out the skirt & it'll be great. The price is also great for the quality of it.

I'm glad I read the reviews before I got it though because had I gotten her the size I normally would, it would have been tiny. I have a 7 or 8 pound pomeranian so I usually get smalls & depending on the item extra smalls. This medium fits her perfectly! It's long enough and also has some stretch to it. So take the advice of everyone else and order a size or two up.

The only con I had is with the shipping. It took almost a month to receive it, which is understandable since it's coming all the way from China. Although, it did come a lot sooner than expected & predicted by the site. I was also unable to track the shipping progress which made me nervous because it's so unpredictable.

So if you're looking to order something cute for a special occasion make sure you do it a month or more in advance.

It has great hang-time, staying aloft for quite a while.  That nice because our dog loves to jump and having it hanging there way above him gives him a good chance to get way off the ground.  But because it has such great hang-time our dog often outruns it so he's at the end of the yard waiting for it to catch up to him.  We've been very deliberate about not letting him chew on the corners and putting it away when we're done.  If your dog is prone to chewing at all it requires some diligence on the human's part or the corners would get chewed off pretty quickly.
