I ordered different gift cards in various dollar amounts, but I kept each gift card style to the amount the same, i.e. the mini-Amazon boxes contained only $50 gift cards. Thank goodness because each box was shrink-wrapped because there was no indication of the dollar amount on the box itself and I was much too lazy to unwrap them to check them all.

But, if you felt compelled to rip off the shrink-wrap, you can open the box and check because it's not a taped box - it's MAGNETIC!! Yes, the box is held closed by hidden magnetic force, which isn't strong but is strong enough to keep the box closed. Amazing!

I don't know how Amazon makes money off of these clever gift card containers that are shipped, but I'm sure there's some mathematical and habitual wizardry regarding gift cards and spending.

Do you get excited when your Amazon Shipment arrives at your door? The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!

The little brown box is about 4.5"" x 3"" x 1"" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.

Open the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the ""Thank you"" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.

It arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.

Would it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.

Recommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!

Ideas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other ""thank you"" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.

At the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.

Love this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars.

When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off.

After all the ""hulabaloo"" about an empty Noodles & Co. gift card, I found out from Noodles corporate office customer setvice that you CANNOT enter all the numbers on the back of the gift card to check the balance...only the last 14 numbers from the card. As it turns out, my gift card was fully loaded and ready to use.  Apparently Noodles had several complaints about the issue over the last few months because they added a special note to their gift card page...""If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits."".

**If you recently gifted a Noodles & Co. gift card, please have your giftee recheck their card balance (only enter the last 14 digits of their card number, omitting the first 5 digits) or contact Noodles directly like I did.  You won't regret either transaction.  It would be nice if AMAZON or the gift card seller would add this info to the product description to save time & money for everyone.

The web page is:  [...]

RUNNING LOW? Check your gift card balance anytime! Enter your gift card ID number found on the back of your card in the box below and click on the ""Submit"" button. If it's time to fill up, you can refuel at your neighborhood Noodles & Company.

If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits.

TIP:  Do join the eClub rewards.  You can get free food and get coupons by email.  It's worth the extra little bit of time plus you will learn about new offerings and menu changes.  I especially love the BOGO coupons.  I like to buy a salad and get a second one for the next day or share with a friend.  Gift the card another look.

NOTE: I was not compensated for my review.

There is no perforation anywhere, nor can you feel the gift card through the cardboard ""envelope."" The back has a barcode and such, so I thought maybe that was what needs to be scanned at checkout, but no. Again, there's a card inside.

Attached is a picture with a ruler and the gift card next to the cardboard.

I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.

I can make a choice, and my choice is to let the birthday person splurge on whatever tickles their fancy. Hence, the gift card.

The inside has a removable black lining insert to hold the gift card. The back has a clear window, & says ""Amazon gift cards"" in very small print.  The tin is reusable & can be used to hold other small items or change. Very nice that Amazon offers this adorable tin with their gift cards.

Amazon gift cards make a great gift because the selection of products offered on this website is Huge!  Unlike giving a gift card to a specific store, restaurant, or for a specific item (i.e. movie tickets, waterparks, etc), an Amazon gift card can be used for whatever the receiver wants. That's a huge perk in gift giving. Other recommendations: Buy it to have on hand as a gift. You never know when you'll be invited to a party or have an event come up where you'll need a quick gift.  No more running around store to store. You'll have this gift on hand.  Another idea- purchase it for yourself. Maybe you know you will want to buy something later in the year. Hang onto the gift card, then you can always easily add it to your account, or right into a family or friends account.",So Adorable!,1469232000,3.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vlxyyN2NL._SY88.jpg']

I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. This e-card is BTW the MVP. Cause: Eta could be 5- 30mins for when you get the e-card. Dominos are open until 1am in some places. Once I had the code me & the girls split some Kicker chicken nuggets. Which when living outdoors in a perpetual state. Real food is prized.
 Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.
This even after the payments I'll end up making is far better than freezing or being hungry.",The real MVP ( May take 30mins when waiting for Email),1479600000,,

One reason I really love the gift card is that I can use it to pay for both myself and my dining friend better than using cash.  When I am paying with cash, several of my friends argue about it and insist on paying.  Sometimes, I want to pay, and I don't want them feeling guilty or fighting over who is paying.  When you have a gift card, you can just say, ""Let me pay.  I have this gift card.""  They never turn down the offer.

Now, about the restaurant.  I love nearly all the menu items, but I really REALLLLY love the Zuppa Toscana, so I usually get the unlimited soup, salad & breadsticks lunch special for $6.99.  Lunch is served fast and I always can get in and out in under an hour.  They always let me take the rest with me, even happy to provide more soup, salad and breadsticks and box it up, so, since I'm single, that's dinner.  Always great service, and let's not forget the after dinner mints.  YUM!",Perfect gift and great for lunch with friends.,1439942400,4.0,

After the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden.

2612,5,True,"07 5, 2017",A3RUNGX8PZ8VYO,B01CT5PHJ2,,Lexus,"I was weary about purchasing this product because of all of those 1-star reviews. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.",7/5/17 - It worked for me (and some tips if you are having issues),1499212800,28.0,
