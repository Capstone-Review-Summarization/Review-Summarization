I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos. I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.

As far as low-key colors go, it's good for work, play and about anything else. Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired. Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.

Overall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

In the past 3 years, I wore imPRESS nails which I loved & I've been using do it yourself LED (light) nail polish which I also love.  The problem is, I tend to pull the imPRESS nails off & pick at the LED polish instead of removing it properly.  Both these bad habits made my peeling nails worse & I've been having trouble strengthening them again.

Through the years, I've used a few different nail strengtheners.  I have a couple favorite brands that  when used according to directions they protect & harden my nails enough that my nails grow out again.  Their (my nails) nature is to peel, so eventually they'll begin peeling...no matter how healthy they are. I also found a filler polish which helps even out the ridges caused by peeling layers.

I've been testing Julep Take A Breather Oxygen Nail Treatment for about two weeks now.  It seems to act as a filler & a nail hardener.  It is a milky pink color which when applied looks more sheer.  It seems to hide imperfections pretty good...my peeled layers look much nicer & smoother.  It also hardens my nail. (I test this by trying to bend my nails that have peeled & are thinner on the edges)
I've been applying two coats, then wait a few days and apply another.  I've found that I don't like the looks of the polish when I use 4 or more coats.  For me to have the polish look presentable, I should remove the polish on about day 5 & start over.

This polish does seem to chip easier than some polishes.
According to instructions, it works best if used alone so I haven't applied additional color on top of it.
It is a sheer pink which looks milky pink but when applied it is sheer & surprisingly helps hide & smooth my peeled layers.
The polish becomes more opaque when 4 or more coats have been applied.  However, I don't like the looks of the polish if I use more than 3 coats.
The container looks like it would easily tip over, but its weight helps keep it upright.  Even at that I am more cautious when using it, especially when I remove excess polish from the brush.

I'm now at the two week mark of using this polish continually, as instructed, and it seems to be working.
I like the way it helps hide/cover/fill-in the layers caused by my peeling nails.  It doesn't completely hide them, but definitely improves their appearance.","After two week test on nails that peel - it is strengthening my nails, my nails are growing out &  helps hide peeled layers",1471046400,,

You pay a lot, you agonize over ingredients you look at reviews and then... wait and see if it has any effect at all. If this product was sold as really thick moisturizing cream with natural ingredients I'd give it 5 stars. I think the thickness people have complained about is because either their skin type is more oily or they're not used to natural products that in my experience are less absorbent or at least slower.
I used this product over several days while in SF with my gf--we were staying with my mom. I mention this because we got a wide variety of skin types to test this product out. As mentioned early it is thick on everyone. The apple smell is amazing. The age defy part though... thats a little nebulous.
My mother who's in her 50's  saw little change, but loved it as a before bed leave on product. She swore in the morning it filled in some of the lines. As thick as this product is, and as long as it takes to set in, I can very much believe that it does rejuvenate some of the dry lines in her face, though it was hard for us to notice anything... but she seemed to like it so thats something?
My partner who's in her 20's hated this product. Her skin is naturally very oily and she thought it felt slick and thick and just not pleasant. Her laugh lines and slight lines around her eyes saw zero change. She was the first to stop using it after just a few applications because she just hated how it felt and had to wipe it down to apply makeup even an hour later.
Lastly I was probably the most apathetic about it. My skin is drier so I didn't mind the thickness, especially right before bed. It still took a little longer than I would have liked to absorb, but I didn't have any major problems like my gf. But that being said I also didn't see any major benefit over this and any other thicker natural moisturizer I've used from kiehls or even neutrogena Norwegian formula.

All in all 2oz isn't great, but its about standard for a high end beauty product so while its not great in the value department its not bad as these things go. And if you realize its a heavier product for either exclusively nighttime use or for very dry skin, that will probably do more to keep you from having weathered skin than anything to actually reverse the process you're gonna get more use out of it.

Will Meg 21 turn out to be as effective as Retin-A?  Only time will tell, but Im curious enough to use it long turn and test out the effect.  I have a lot of creepy skin under my eyes, so I will take some before pictures and after a few months of use I will take some after pictures to compare.

31132,4,False,"06 20, 2016",AAA0TUKS5VBSA,B01DQ1CEMG,,Nerd Alert,"I have used a couple IPL systems before, including a different Silk'n model and the Philips Lumea.  Both work well, and I was excited to try out this system that promised to be more compact for getting into tight places.  Unfortunately, it is almost identical to the Lumea, and I don't say that to be dramatic.  It is seemingly the same unit with a purple trim portion and carrying case.  Thankfully, the Lumea is a nice unit, but my hopes of a smaller detail hair removal tool were dashed.  My guess is that only very specific models have been FDA approved, limiting the diversity in home systems.

If you are new to IPL, I will try to give a brief overview.  The IPL system has emits a burst of light at a frequency that is absorbed by pigmented areas, with the goal being to heat up the base of the hair follicles enough to damage them.  With repeated use over months and years, the hair will grow back thinner and more slowly, making it much easier to keep smooth.  So, this will only work on relatively light skin and relatively dark hair.  If your skin is dark, it will absorb the light before it gets to the hair root.  That means it won't work, plus it might burn you.  The more pigmented areas of the body like the genitals or thicker hair density areas like a man's face are not advised for these home systems, but certainly they are done with more powerful systems in a clinical setting.  I think the main point of that warning is to avoid liability.  If you choose to do it anyway, start with the lower intensity light to make sure you don't burn yourself.

As with the Lumea, you can hold the button down between flashes to cause it to flash as soon as it is ready.  That makes going over large areas easier than the original Silk'n.  Since it has the same shape head, with a large border, it is awkward to use under the nose or other creases.  However, it can be done.  Even large areas are pretty quick and the pain isn't bad if you have pale skin.

For home use, this is as good as it gets right now.  It's still a bit clunky and low powered compared to professional treatments, but persistence does pay off.  Don't expect quick results and be disciplined and you'll likely be pleased.  The main alternative is doing electrolysis, but I find that challenging without causing scarring on myself.","Works Well, But Identical to Lumea",1466380800,7.0,

To my eye, after using this for several weeks, a scar that I have on the side of my neck appears lighter and less noticeable - perhaps the effects of the niacin/vitamin B, or perhaps just from being moisturized daily.  In any case, it's an improvement.

I'm glad that I read the other reviews before I began to use this, because it did cause a reddening appearance and a slight burning feeling when I tested it out the first time.  I used my wrist as a test spot, and the redness went away after a few minutes, so I went ahead and tried it on my neck.  It did get a little red and warm feeling for a bit, but this decreased to the point where it is unnoticeable after 2 weeks.  I absolutely think that they should put this as a warning on the side of the jar.

The cream itself, outside of the health effects, is nice to use, although not my favorite.  It seems that some people can smell a weird or chemically smell from it, and some can't or enjoy the smell.  I fall into the first category.  The smell, to me, seems like compost or soured greens.  I'm not a big fan.  The feel of the cream is cushiony but I find it slightly greasy compared to some of my other creams.  On the other hand, unlike some of the other creams I've used, it has NOT caused acne on my neck.

For example, if I'm having a hormonal day where I feel like I might break out, I apply the oil onto my wet hands and rub it around first before applying to my face to kind of dilute the oil and keep me from breaking out. Other times when I need more moisture, I rubbed the oil onto my dry hands and apply directly.

I have tried a variety of beauty oils for the face, and I usually like ones with the most natural ingredients, though I do intersperse them with using a regular moisturizer just because I find a lot of the oils sit on my face and don't sink in quite as effectively as I might hope. That said, they provide a great barrier of protection for those days when I have to be outside more, because I work as a landscaper there are a lot of days when I am in the elements.

This oil falls short in the ingredients department into really notable ways: first, the artificial fragrance is absolutely awful. On first sniff, it's not too bad, however I'm not used to having a facial oil be fragranced. Given that fragrance is one of the primary skin irritants, and given the fact that people usually use facial oils when they have delicate, sensitive, or aging skin, why in the world would they muck up a premium product by adding such a common irritant that many people don't like? I can tell you that if I want to smell the fragrance on my skin all day, it won't be something like this  I would instead carefully select a fragranced lotion or perfume. I don't look to my facial oil to provide a fragrant ambience to my day.

Then, later in the ingredients it contains hydrogenated vegetable oil. I don't know about you, but when I cook with vegetable oil, it tends to break me out. I don't see any justification at all for putting hydrogenated vegetable oil in such an expensive facial oil product. There are wonderful facial oils on the market that are fairly inexpensive in comparison to this  definitely less than half of the retail price, that do not contain any of this junk. In addition, you can find ones for cheaper that have coldpressed or organic ingredients. Just here locally, I have a number of vendors blending up beautiful, simple facial oil blends with truly high-end ingredients and they do not charge so much money for them.

I can't speak to the long-term effects of using this oil because I couldn't tolerate it. In fact, on the first day of using, I had to wash my face multiple times to try to get the fragrance off, because it was making my face well and making me need to sneeze. The fragrance is not that bad, I am just extremely sensitive to fragrance on my skin care products. However, I use a number of Korean beauty products and even though a few of them do have fragrance, the vast majority don't have anything like this. I've also used a lot of lush facial products, all of which do have some natural essential oil fragrance, and those don't bother me either. This really smells like a drugstore shampoo, and why in the world they would put it on a facial oil, I really can't tell you.

There is some good stuff in here, but the fact that it's overshadowed by an overbearing fragrance and a few questionable ingredients, plus a lack of organic or coldpressed oils, makes me think that the price tag is just due to Cindy Crawford's name and not due to the ingredients. It's a shame. From reading the ingredients I had higher hopes.","Too strongly fragranced for a facial oil, and contains hydrogenated vegetable oil?",1483920000,12.0,

I tend to be lax about skin care routines and rarely bother with makeup, but I am using Aqualia regularly because I absolutely adore the light, mildly floral fragrance.  This product not only smells wonderful, it doesn't set off any sinus twitching in my chemically-sensitive nose. That's a very good thing.

My oily youth has paid off - my very mature skin isn't terribly dry, so this product is perfect for me. I use it morning and night after washing my face (and sometimes in the afternoon because it's so refreshing). I just put a little on a cotton pad and rub it in. It seems to clean my skin a little more after the soap, which is pretty impressive. And it feels sooo good.

Aqualia absolutely keeps my face more hydrated than it normally would be - that's obvious on drier days. On very dry days, I put a little moisturizing cream on top of it, especially if I'm going out.

I've been testing this product in winter and I love how refreshing it is. In summer, it's going to be over-the-moon pleasurable to use! I will be purchasing more before this bottle runs out.

While not inexpensive, if you don't soak your cotton pad too heavily, this will last quite a while. (I don't recommend using cotton balls because they will make it go too fast.) If your skin is anything but very dry, I'd recommend giving Thermal Facial Essence Water a try.

I put it on my toes and it still looked perfect several days later.  It was very easy to apply, despite the glitter (which can sometimes make polish less smooth -- but not in this case!).

It did take three coats to become opaque, instead of the usual two.  However, since it's mostly glitter without a base color, that's not too bad.  I used a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat (no base coat) and it helped this polish to dry quickly.

I thought the brush was nice.  I kind of don't like the rectangular ""extra"" black cap on top of the applicator, though.  It seems like a waste of plastic and it was a little difficult for me to remove, for some reason.  However, overall, this is a good polish -- even if it's been sitting around for close to a year (just shake it up a bit) and I think I will get many uses out of it.  Free of lots of different toxic ingredients, as well.

Update: Two weeks later, some of the glitter had rubbed off my smallest toes.  However, that's still pretty long wear.  Also, this was one of the easier glitter polishes I've tried when it comes to removal.","beautiful, long-lasting glitter",1405209600,,

I have combination skin, so take that as you will.

If I apply this after my normal cleansing ritual and before applying moisturizer, it does reduce the look of fine lines (and I'm a former smoker, so I'm always happy to reduce the appearance of wrinkles which prematurely aged my skin through my own folly), but the effect does not seem to be permanent and fades after a few hours.

I've tried several beauty serums - mostly free samples - and thus far have not found one which works on my skin to produce the purported effects which the marketing departments claim.  On the other hand, this serum is organic and not full of nasty chemicals. It has a pleasant scent which I did not find overpowering.  It is also not oily and did not make me break out, as many of the beauty serums have done in the past, so I consider that a win, as well.

Although I do not believe that this serum has had a permanent age-reversing effect on my skin, as a temporary measure, it works very well. The one thing I don't particularly like about this serum is that my face feels sticky after application, which is slightly unsettling. But this does not interact with my moisturizer, primer or foundation makeup, so it's just a mild inconvenience.

As a longtime retin-a user who has no problem with the hard stuff, I really like this cream: the consistency, the mild scent, even the sturdy silver tube that is easy to spot in dim light. It's one of the few products I've tried that keeps working all night, so that I wake up without dry skin.

When I find a product I love, I always like to try other products from the brand.  I received a generous sample of the Flouride Hydratant Anti-age Moisturizer, said to reduce wrinkles with firming peptides.

I am naturally drawn to any product that says ""firming peptides"".  I'm in my 30's, my skin is starting to sag a little bit and needs a little boost.  This product is made with Certified Organic Ingredients, another plus.  It also contains alpha lipoic acid, CoQ10 (a firming agent), Vitamin C, peptides and DMAE.  It sounds like a really great product.

The very first time I used it, I didn't like the smell.  It didn't smell like apples or like the peel at all.  To me, it smells like a regular Jergens lotion mixed with a hint of a clay mask.  I also found this moisturizer to be very thick and heavy.  I started applying it at night only to see how it would feel on my skin.  Right away my skin felt heavy and greasy.  I have natural oily skin so this was a bad combination for me.  When I woke up the next morning my face felt like an oil slick.  To give the product a fair shot, I used it again in the am, under makeup, which was a total disaster.  I applied my liquid foundation over top and because the product had never fully absorbed, rather sat on top of the skin, my skin was so sticky all day.  I felt like my face was so dirty.

The price point, in my opinion is very high too.  For $45, I have found many other moisturizers that work better on my oily skin.  This product may be good for someone with really dry skin that needs super duper moisture, but for a girl with oily skin, it's no good.","Too Thick and Heavy, Caused My Face to Be Greasy",1456876800,3.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iWKIhH04L._SY88.jpg']

The moisturizer is thinner than most I've been using lately, but it does not leave a greasy footprint like the thicker options. The formula feels very loose and liquid-y, almost as if it were water-based. A small dab - about the size of half a non-shooter marble - is enough for a foot and calf. A little goes a long way here.

The fragrance is probably the biggest love-it-or-hate-it point. The fragrance is very strong in a ""insistent"" sort of way. I don't find it overwhelming, but you won't forget that it's there. It does remind me of almonds in a drinkable almond milk sort of way. However for those calling the scent chemically, I can see that too. It doesn't smell natural, but it doesn't smell wholly artificial to me either.

Performance-wise, I am a fan. The moisturizer soaks in quickly and works for at least 24hrs between showers. My skin is soft and I do not find myself needing to reapply as the day goes on. Having said that the scent isn't offensive, I wouldn't suggest using this as a face cream - the smell is probably too much for that proximity to your nose.","First time with a L'Occitane product, and I am a fan",1417910400,,

It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps.

Inside are small capped vials intended to provide one application.  There is also a ""dropper"" that screws onto the bottle (with cap removed) to dab your scalp with the ""liquid"".  Similar to dying your hair/roots.

The enclosed instructions are woefully incomplete.  Basically says, ""make three straight lines down your scalp"" (and massage in).  Three lines?  Where...side-to-side?  front-to-back?  There are youtubes available, but I wasn't in the mood to sit through a video when I just wanted to test the product.  So I focused on the areas of where my hair is thinning the most and then randomly dabbed, massaged in, added my usual small amount of gel & leave-in conditioner and partially blow-dried.

If I use too much in one area, the combination of my hair and the liquid leaves my hair feeling somewhat clumped and like it's dirty (my fault).  If I'm patient, it absorbs well.  My hair did ""feel"" like it was more full upon drying (though that isn't part of its claim).

Recommended to use three times to freshly washed damp hair (and then dry as usual) per week.

I'm skeptical these days, but after two weeks (9 applications), something DOES FEEL different.  I know that isn't scientific and vague, but I'm still curious to see the results after a month's use.  (and I will update then)

Where I can definitely feel a difference is when I condition (after shampoo) and rinse out the conditioner, I have nowhere near the hair in my hands than before using this product.  The claim is that it anchors the hair to the follicle ~ and to that note, I do have far less hair loss after conditioning/rinsing.

Recommended is 3 months use and if my results continue in this positive direction, I feel encouraged to purchase two more sets at their pricey amount.

At first, I used this serum on my face thinking it would eliminate the minor redness I get on my cheeks when I drink even a single glass of wine. It had no effect. So I was about to join the naysayers when it occurred to me to try the serum on my arms where I've had this awful rash FOR YEARS. My dermatologist has tried endless diagnostic techniques (allergy tests, biopsies, microscopic analyses, etc.), has prescribed prednisone, steroid creams, UV therapy, OTC creams, etc. and has never been able to get me relief for more than a couple of hours. She has never even been able to give a name to the rash, just says it is not rosacea or psoriasis. I have been miserable for years. Sounds melodramatic unless you've had a life-damaging skin problem, but if you've suffered too, you understand.

I applied the tiniest drop of Rosaliac AR Intense to my rash and the itching stopped immediately. Frankly, that didn't impress me because almost any lotion will stop the itching for a few minutes or even a couple of hours. What I needed was something that would stop the itching and calm the rash so I could get a full night's sleep. Well, that first night I got a full night's sleep. In the morning the itching still had not come back. After my next shower, I applied a few drops again and the rash and itching remain gone. I continue to be able to sleep and to go through the day without any itching. I frankly cannot believe it, so if you're skeptical I don't blame you. But it's true.

If this serum stops working, I will definitely update this review because I don't want anyone to have false hope as I've had so many times.

With conscientious use it does appear to help with under-eye bags It doesn't completely eliminate them (nothing short of surgery would, I think) but it does alleviate the puffiness and reduce the redness.

I have tested it for almost a month--a month in which I was under a lot of stress due to my husband's surgeries. I haven't slept well and am run down. So, if under these circumstances, I saw a slight improvement in my under-eye area, I imagine that under normal circumstances the improvement would have been greater.

It has a slight scent that disappears after a few minutes, and is very easy to smooth on. It comes in a small opaque plastic jar with a pump that dispenses a large droplet--enough to smooth under both eyes with a bit left over to smooth under both brows. Because the jar is opaque, it's impossible to tell how much is left.

The skin around the eyes is very sensitive and I have often had allergic reactions to many creams but I had none with this one. I have used many eye creams over the years and usually find them effective IF you use them twice a day (morning and bed time).

This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

I was surprised to see Henckels in the grooming business, and I was excited to give this trio a try.

All in all, though, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I suppose I let my past experience with Henckels build up my expectations. I thought this would be the best grooming said I had ever seen, but it turned out to be just pretty good.  This trio of devices is packaged in a little leather pouch with a snap. The pieces didn't fit all too well in the pouch, and I got an immediate sense of cheapness in the whole presentation. The leather pouch comes in a bag which comes in a box, but after all those steps, what you see is kind of a let down. The pieces are shiny silver in that Henckels way, looking a lot like our knives actually.

The manually-operated nose hair clipper was painful. It looks like something  that should have a battery, but you hand turn it. My nose hairs got caught and pulled, ouch. Not a great experience. The other pieces were better. The nail file was nice but very basic, no better than any other I have used over the years. The nail clipper was the best of the bunch. It's super thin and unfolds nicely, works well.

All in all, there is nothing wrong with this say it, but it just did not impress me the way I hoped it might. Between the packaging and my personally painful encounter with the nose hair trimmer, I hesitate to recommend this, even as a gift.","Not impressed, considering it's Henckels",1442880000,,

Herein is my review of this product that I received to sample without charge.

A note to the reader:  I will do my best to give you a fair, accurate, and unbiased view of this skin care product.

Like most people, I feel that if something goes on my face it should be gentle and beneficial.  It is not acceptable that there should be discomfort or harmful effects.

To that end, this is a good product in that it meets those basic criteria.  It is gentle, easy to use, pleasant smelling, and it leaves the face looking better without excessive redness or ""blotchiness"".  It does feel nice and soothing on the skin

Others have reported a tingling sensation- I would agree, although it is only slight, there is no pain, and this tingling is transient.  I also do not leave this exfoliant peel on longer than 10 minutes.  I tried the sensitive skin product-it is a lot less `caustic' and harsh than other hydroxy acid products that are available.

After use, the face is glowing, slightly pinker, and moist. There is no flaking, burning, or drying. The skin feels super clean, plumper, hydrated,  and perhaps more `balanced'.  The skin tone looks more even and improved after use.

I have used it several times about every 7-10 days. without  noticing any ill effect. I've not  had to discontinue use for any reasons.  There has been no rash or skin outbreak.

With any new skin product (new to me), I patch test it first:  Before liberal use/application, apply a small amount to an area you can monitor (such as the under belly of the forearm). I see they recommend trying it behind the ear (I like the forearm better-easier to regulate). If no itching or redness develops, it is not likely that an allergy has occurred.  You might then want to try more use and greater distribution.  But, when in doubt, always stop use and consult your physician.

JUICE BEAUTY has a nice web site-take a look. It's quite informative and readily details their skin care philosophy and `mission statement'.

The components of their skin care line are discussed.  Chiefly, they use a blend of fruit stem cells infused into a Vitamin C, resveratrol-rich grape seed formula. This line of organic products uses natural and organically found chemical ingredients that are found in the fruit stem cells of apples, grapes and lemons.  This skin care line is somewhat unique in that it makes use of resveratrol-a naturally occurring helpful chemical commonly found in grape seeds.  In the past, it was less common to find that in a readily accessible product.

""JUICE BEAUTY skin care products are made with naturally occurring chemicals found in fruit and are never made with  petroleum by-products, `parabens,or propylene or butylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfates,  pesticides, phthalates. No artificial or synthetic dyes or fragrances are present in this product line.""

As the skin tolerates this well and there is a good result, I will incorporate this Green Apple Peel into my facial skin care regimen and I plan to continue using this after this initial sample is done.  I am pleased with this product, no complaints.

EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database rates the Juice Beauty  products quite favorably-among the best ratings out there. That site allows you to easily get the safety evaluation of your cosmetic products.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.

This product, the Clear, comes in a Rx version and this non-Rx version.

Just bought another tube.
I can never be without this again.
It's like it magically last 24 hours bc I've ""checked "" myself the next day & thought
I can use my old deo.  Oh no, 2 hours into my sweaty shift, I was reminded why I love this deo.

Upgrading to 5 stars.

Btw, does soothe after shave as well.

Original review-
First, I have to say~ I thought when I read this was a cream I was going to have to put it on with my finger which made me a bit hesitant to try.

The tube has a rounded tip that allows you to squeeze & apply like a roll on.
So bonus point right there. (See pic)

The tube is about 3 inches long so, about half the size of a roll on/stick & travel friendly.

You squeeze tube until 1/2"" of cream comes out and rub it into your skin with the rounded tip like applying lotion.

Now, a little background on what this deodorant was up against... (Poor guy had no idea of the torture it was about to encounter)

I work special events in formal wear ( White long sleeve shirt, black polyester vest And tie, black pants) in the Florida humid, sticky, brutal heat.

I carry deodorant & body spray with me because no matter what I use, after about an hour...
I can't stand the smell of myself.

My uniform creates a sauna of heat with no escape.

All I can say it's after 8 hours running, sweat dripping from my face, I'm clean.

Now this is a deodorant not anti persperant so it's not designed to keep you dry but I'm pretty fresh.

It goes on white & creamy so maybe not little black dress approved but this will save you in the summer heat.

There is no scent so should work on the masses.

All I can say is, I took a chance on this because I love my Vichy after shower skin firming cream in the pink tub & I'm glad I did.

This is a game changer.

I don't know what would happen if one mixed this primer with a moisturizer that has fragrance. Just saying. Anyway, I applied moisturizer first, let it sink in, then applied the primer and moisturizer mixed together over the top. I liked it very much that way. It gave my cheeks that glow, even after I applied my dry foundation. This would be excellent for someone who does not wear makeup, but would like to give their face a fresher look. I know as we age, our skin can get a ash-like coloring, so this is a nice solution...or if we are just looking tired, and as a wife and mother, that is relatively often. It works with or without foundation. So, yes, I am glad that I took the time to find out if I was using it correctly or if there was a better way to make it work for me.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

This is the sort of scent I adore....with green & woodsy notes, rather than a face full of florals! I feel as if I'm in a forest after a light rain. Heaven!

The top note is certainly a bit fruity, sweet, and powdery. I also get grassy undertones. There's a distinct ""greenness"" that opens up this fragrance. It then settles into a smoky, spicy scent where the nutmeg is detectable as the sweetness fades. Citadelle then settles into it's primary basenote, a heady VETIVER dry down. That's where this fragrance really shines. The vetiver base lasts and lasts. Silage (longevity) for me is about 4 hours, which is very good for me....I find that most perfume doesn't last a long time on me unless it's cloying. But if you're looking for a scent that lasts all day, this isn't it. It's a LIGHT fragrance, very wearable for work, not heavy and does not ""project"".

One of my all time favorite perfumes is Sycomore by Chanel. It's very expensive, a scent I've saved only for special occasions. Citadelle reminds me of a lighter version of Sycomore, in many ways more wearable because it has less of a dark/heavy feeling about it. This is a scent that can be worn year round, rather than just saving it for Fall/Winter months. If you love Vetiver & tree/green smelling perfumes, you'll enjoy Citadelle. It's certainly more affordable than Chanel, or Encre Noir by Lalique and the lightness of it will win over those who feel that those scents are a bit too heavy and overbearing.

Unisex? Yes! My husband likes this scent very much. This fragrance is in no way too girly. No floral notes anywhere! But he'll have to get his own bottle....this one is MINE and I'm not giving it up.

A lot of plant based or all natural treatments contain aloe, which Im allergic to.  So I was very glad to see that this treatment for lips didnt.  It does promise a lot, though.  Its supposed to visibly reduce the appearance of vertical lines, smooth, soften, and plump the delicate lip area.  Also, lipstick will glide on beautifully and you can say goodbye to lipstick bleed!

This lip treatment is different than anything Ive ever tried.  Its neither a balm nor a gloss and its not in a tube.  Its a very light cream (the box describes it as delicate) and its in a tiny little jar. It has a very light, very soft feel to it as it goes on.  Unlike practically anything else Ive ever used on my lips, this product absorbs into the lips really quickly.  And while it doesnt leave a waxy or greasy layer on the lips, you definitely know its there  lips are moisturized, soft, and rosy (even though its not tinted at all). A little goes a long way, which is great considering the price.

I haven't been using it long, only about two weeks.  So I cant really say if it will ever really reduce the signs of aging around my mouth.  But I have noticed that my lips look healthier. Ive always had a huge problem with chapping and peeling  I have lip balms stuck everywhere because of it  and that has not been as severe since Ive been using the VENaffect.  In fact, I don't reach for the lip balm as much as I used to.  Lipstick does go on smoother when using it and it stays truer to color because the balm isn't watering it down. Actually, I prefer to put it on before any other makeup and smooth it in the area around my lips, too.

Its not exactly the type of thing Id want to carry around in one of my nice handbags for fear it the lid would come off  it would take up more space than a tube of balm anyway.  I try to use it at least three times per day: in the morning under my lipstick, before I go to the gym, and then again before bed.

The only sticking point for me, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars, is the price.  Eighty five dollars ($85.00) is a lot of money to pay for a tiny jar of lip cream.

This potion is very smooth and silky going on, and covers very well.  Almost like it's skimming along the surface of your skin more so than being absorbed by it, although after a bit of time it seems to be 'in' the skin. It has a pleasant scent, but does leave a slightly sticky residue on your hands and face. (Very noticeable as flakes on the skin if too much product is used.)

The product's website details this product in the following way:

""This powerful, dual-action anti-aging serum helps visibly lift skin and acts as a non-invasive line filler to help temporarily smooth out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It contains a rare, exclusive orchid extract which comes from the Emerald Coast of France and is designed to enhance natural production of healthy collagen and elastin in the skin.""

It's part of a skin care line that if used regularly promises amazing results. Unfortunately I don't have the entire line to try out, but this 'filler' - used to temporarily smooth fine lines and wrinkles - is a good product from my brief usage of it. It does add a moisturized layer to the skin; especially around the eyes, that gives the skin a plumper appearance.  Used underneath my mineral make-up, I noticed a subtle, positive difference.

I do get a slight blotchy redness right after applying it, and some very minor tingling.  This does disappear rather quickly though. I think using less is actually better and it may not be necessary to smooth it all over your face as much as the areas around your neck, mouth and eyes.

This product is expensive by comparison to other products I've used and I look forward to giving it at least 30 days to work its magic. Ideally I would use it for 3 months, but I'm not sure there's that much product in this 1 fl oz bottle.  I'll definitely update this review the longer I use the product to let Amazon shoppers know my experience with it over an extended period of time.

--------------------------------------

UPDATE:  7/18/16 - After a month of consistent use I can say this product works very well to make my whole face and neck feel moisturized.  My skin seems plumper - more elastisity - and does seem to make the appearance of fine lines (especially around my eyes) significantly less noticable.

This stuff is really remarkable in the sense that it takes one pump (very small amount) to get full coverage.  My 49 year old skin is generally fairly dry so I was afraid this product would be sucked in never to be seen again.  Much to my delight it went on silky smooth, with no oily residue.

The inital red, blotchy skin reaction I got when I used it went away within a week of use. Maybe my skin got used to it?  Really smooth applicaiton with no tingling after two weeks of use.

On the downside, it's not ideal with mineral make-up.  What generally had a matte appearance became more 'oily' looking. Perhaps it was the timing of the application of my makeup, but I always tried to apply these two products at least 1 hour apart to give it time to absorb.  Despite this, I would continue to use it. It's not a miracle cream, but it is very good!  I still have product in the bottle after 1 month which is truly surprising to me.

This brand is new to me.  I have the ""ProQuinoa complex"" conditioner with sage since it appears that multiple items have been listed on this page in the past.

My particular hair concerns were frizz and color protection.  I have naturally light colored hair that I dye black, and it can get kind of brassy looking in the summer.  And I exercise a lot, so I have to wash my hair every day.  My hair tends to dry out because of this, which leads to frizz, since I live in Georgia and it is summertime.

I find that my hair soaks this up a lot more than it does with conditioners that have more oil in them (this has coconut oil, but it is pretty far down the ingredients list).  Unfortunately, that means I have to use a lot of this product to get good coverage.  That is one reason I have taken off a star -- I am going to run out of this very quickly.

With regards to color protection, my hairdresser did a semi-permanent color rinse a few weeks back to try to get rid of some of the brassiness (in her professional opinion this would look best and I trust her judgment).  And, that is still working, despite shampooing and conditioning my hair every day in between.  My roots (with permanent dye) are also looking good.  So I am happy with the color protection aspect of this product.

With respect to frizz, this isn't doing as much as I'd like.  It does promise to smooth and soften the hair, and it kind of delivers on that.  My hair is definitely softer afterwards.  And I think I am seeing fewer flyaways.  So it is OK but not great in that regard.  (I use detanglers and oils afterwards to control frizz and if you do that, this could still work for you.)  It may be just too difficult to overcome the Georgia summer humidity.  But I still have to use all my anti-frizz products after I wash my hair.

For the ""ProQuinoa"" complex conditioner, I am not sure the ingredients list in the product images is up to date.  Here is the most recent version I could find (as of August 2016):

Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Lauryl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Bromide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Citric Acid, , Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Coconut Oil, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Barley Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sage Oil, Sage Leaf Extract, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl-3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Phenoxyethanol, Mica, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides).

I think maybe the reason I am not getting the results I want is because the ingredients that work for me in conditioners (oils and silicones) are far down the list here, so there isn't much of them.

This is not to say this is a bad product, just that it's not 100% appropriate for my hair type.  If frizz and flyaways aren't concerns for you, and your hair isn't particularly dry, or if you have finer hair and don't want to use a strongly oil-based conditioner, but want some color protection, this may be perfect.  If you have thicker, coarser, drier hair like I do, though, this will not be anything special.",not the best for my hair type but will work for some people,1471910400,2.0,

I also tend to splurge on facial products so I liked the notion of something that would enhance the effectiveness of what I've already been using.  I've been also using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarisonic-Mia-2-Sonic-Skin-Cleansing-System-Lavender/dp/B00B9UE8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarisonic Mia 2 Sonic Skin Cleansing System, Lavender</a>&nbsp;which claims to improve your skin's absorption of Vitamin C, but this was the first topical product I've seen that claims to boost performance of your skin care routine.  To give context to the rest of the review, I'm a 30-something with skin that is acne-prone but also sensitive and dry as a side effect of two rounds of Accutane in the past.  As a result, I look for products that make my skin look soft and hydrated, while avoiding things that overly irritate my skin or aggravate breakouts.

When opening this product I first appreciated how well packaged it is.  My bottle came tightly sealed in plastic and not a drop was unaccounted for.  Given how expensive this is per ounce I much appreciated that none is wasted.  The instructions, however, leave a lot to be desired.  It seems to be one instruction sheet for many StriVectin products.  In fact, at first I thought it was a sheet for the wrong product until I realized the Booster Oil was mentioned, just for only a couple of sentences.  It's a shame because with a product this expensive I always want to better understand how it works and how to best apply it for maximum effectiveness.  Here the instructions were simple and straight forward.  Apply 2-3 drops to my face with or without moisturizer and then follow up with my usual serum.  It didn't specify that it had to be StriVectin Serum so I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ole-Henriksen-Truth-Serum-Collagen-Booster-1-7-oz/dp/B007W0JA70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ole Henriksen Truth Serum Collagen Booster 1.7 oz</a>&nbsp;because that's what I'm using at the moment.

When I went to apply this the first thing I realized was that I didn't love the application process.  Essentially you screw off the lid to reveal a dropper.  I like that the dropper gives you a precise measurement of how much you need, but I don't like that the rest of the container is essentially open making it easy to spill.  All the other pricy serums I've used have had more of a pump-type dispenser which makes it harder to spill or waste product.  Applying it to my skin was also tricky because 2-3 drops didn't seem to go very far. Adding it to moisturizer does seem to make it easier to apply to the entire face.  However it does make me wonder if it will make this booster lose its effectiveness and potency because many of the topical prescription products I've used for my face have specified applying it to a clean face and letting it absorb fully before adding lotion.  When applied without the lotion it feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.  Even though it is an oil you are applying so little to your skin that it doesn't feel greasy.  The scent isn't overly pleasant but thankfully is also not noxious and seemed to dissipate quickly enough.  I then followed up as directed with my serum.

Generally I find these things take a couple months to fully see the effects so I plan to report back after I've had more experience with this product to see whether it does seem to be boosting my skincare routine and how long the bottle lasts.  (Yes, it's pricy but similar products I've used that have only required 2-3 drops have lasted me for months.)

----

Rating Explanation: Really, 3.5 stars (4.0 for the softness and for how foundation doesn't cake onto the brush and how it blends in well; 3.0 stars for bristles falling out and the price being a little high compared to my usual foundation brush, which was half the price and does the job well, too)

General Description: A small, handle-textured, soft-bristled 'buffing' brush--black, with a tiny loop with which to hang it (after washing or if you want to hang it otherwise). Price now: about $21.00

General Comments: Makeup brushes can be expensive, but I probably would not spend $21 on this brush since on first use some of the bristles fell out--not many, mind you, but after that happened I read a few other reviews and found that after washing this has happened. With my experience, it was right out of the box I lost some bristles as I applied my foundation as directed. So, for review purposes, after one use, I gently washed it - as I did, a few more fell out (again, not very many). After drying, I used it again and a few more came out. In all total, there were not very many bristles to fall out but this does make me wonder if this is normal upon first few uses -- that in manufacturing some bristles are going to be loose and with use this will stop, or if with continued use and washing more and more bristles will fall out. Time will tell but this does seem to be an issue with this brush.

Applying Foundation: As the instructions indicated, I applied liquid foundation right to the brush. I placed just a tiny amount, for I wanted to do this in a layering application. I swirled the small dab of foundation on half my face (for comparison with my regular makeup brush on the other side). The brush is extremely soft on my face--this I did like very much. And my makeup disappeared into my skin quite quickly. I put just a little more foundation on the brush and swirled that into the same side of my face and again it disappeared. It was a nice finish, I will say. When I applied my foundation with my regular flat-bristled foundation brush on the other side of my face as I usually do it, I really could not tell that much of a difference, though there may have been a slight difference, but not enough I could really say for sure. My foundation brush is half the price of this one.

Positive Point: 4.0 stars for this: One difference between this brush and my regular foundation brush that interested me is that my regular foundation brush you can see the residue of makeup on it, but the Japonesque didn't have any residue that I could see! That in itself was pretty amazing. Perhaps with more use it would but I believe with small applications and swirling it in thoroughly, most of the makeup would end up on your face and not left on the brush--which is a good thing.

Negative Point: bristles falling out, and the loop is pretty small--not sure where I'm to hang it.

I would like to try this with mineral makeup (I am out of that right now) to see how it does but I expect it to do well with mineral (""powder"") make up. I wouldn't use this as a blush brush simply because of it's shape; however, I suppose it would blend in blush very nicely.",I'm beginning to like this brush!,1458259200,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CtVdS4zqL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j82w6yPuL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fIk-0i5eL._SY88.jpg']"

Of course Proraso is legendary among wetshavers as a cream that rivals other shaving creams that are double or triple the price in terms of quality. It is also known to be a good cream for those new to wetshaving as it is more forgiving in the lathering process than other creams, which can easily be too dry or to soupy if you don't use the exact right amount of water to mix it. Some people do not like the sandalwood scent of this product, but I like it. It is not overly scented, but it is more peppery than what you usually get with a sandalwood scent. Some say this a truer sandalwood scent, I cannot comment about that, but I do like this particular scent and think it smells manly. It is also a scent that lasts, which I take as a mark of Proraso quality. They seem to really care about the quality of their products.

The Green menthol cream is the original Proraso and many people swear by that cream. However, I did not like the smell of that cream at all, as I thought it was just awful. I would bear it in order to use the cream, but I hated the smell. Also, I do think this is better at taming a thicker beard than the original (though that could just be their marketing working on me). It definitely doesn't dry your skin out as much as the menthol original and that is a big deal to me. This is now my new favorite Proraso product.

It's a very popular brand and is considered by some to be the ""gold"" standard of flat irons. I think I paid $100 for mine. While it's much better than cheap flat irons, what I don't like about it is you can't adjust the heat (it gets VERY hot) and it makes my hair very flat. Straight, but flat. I was eager to see how this T3 Micro Single Pass Luxe compares, especially being so expensive.

First, the packaging is luxurious. It comes in a beautiful box with a lid. Inside you find an elegant iron and two hair clips, plus an envelop containing the instructions and a heat-resistant resting pad. Of course, looks don't really matter (only performance does), but it's a pretty presentation nonetheless.

This iron comes with multiple heat setting, which is a big, big plus. Although my hair is curly, the strands are very silky--thus, easy to straighten. I don't need sky-high temps (like the CHI) to straighten my hair.

The plates are so smooth that they glide down the hair effortlessly. The first few times I had to look closely because it seemed like they weren't even touching my hair (they were).

The end result? Wow! I got straight, silky hair that wasn't flat and clinging to my head. Really different than what the CHI does. The next morning I woke up and my hair was still beautiful.

I thought everyone was fine in our nice cozy rental home with great heat. Only to learn within days of going in and out, that everyone would suffer so much from dry skin.  Again, as a Floridian, I heard of people complaining about cracked, dry skin, but I didn't realize how bad it could get.

After reading numerous reviews, I see that many people use this Rose water to help with dry skin.  That's so amazing that you can actually use something natural to help.

So After returning home with the misery of dry skin, we tried the spray. It seems to work very well to moisturize and soften the skin.  It does have a very pleasant smell, one that takes me back to my childhood. When I first sprayed it, it feels very cool. After it dries,  I do notice that my skin feels soft.

The product literature recommends spraying your face each night before bed. I will continue this regimen to see if it actually helps.

With a new bottle, I peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.

You do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. Part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. You may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. If you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. It does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.

This would not work well for extensive baldness (nothing does!), but works well for the dreaded ""wide part"" problem. Dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light-skinned person, as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair.

They have a really small travel-size that I carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!

One suggestion for Toppik company is to make the darn container transparent - it is completely opaque, so there is no way to know when you are running out, except to shake it in the sink.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

It's so embarrassing that I don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator.

Toppik has completely changed my life. It's not perfect but look at it like makeup. It covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. I have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that I started using it and asked if they saw any difference. They said ""That stuff is F--- AMAZING!"" If you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.

It's not gonna stay on overnight. It's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat.

I decided to try this one because I was interested in the cleanser and night cream.  I didn't like that there wasn't a detailed, but simple description of each product on the Amazon page.  Instead there was a long blah-blah-blah description of leaf serum.  You have to purchase the box to see each item and what they do.  I did get this from Amazon to test for free in lieu of an honest review.

I am 53 and very Caucasian.  My face used to break out a little when I was younger, mostly from environment.  My face will breakout with some makeup. I also have to wear glasses and I hate that I have to wear my glasses to in front of the bathroom sink to read the directions on what each one does.  Take a hint Meaningful Beauty.  We're old.  We have wrinkles.  We're farsighted!

I used the exfoliating cream felt nice and didn't burn my face like others have in the past.  It did seem to work on my neck which felt smoother.

I then used the cleanser.  It was crap.  It didn't really clean anything.  I put it on showered and put my nail to my face because it felt like there was a film on it.  Nope, the film was actually my foundation still on my face.

I faired better with the SPF 30 moisturizer.  It was light and went nicely with my foundation.  We did a lot better here.  But...we'll get to that in a minute.

The night cream went on heavier than the Oil of Olay I normally use.  I had to take an extra minute washing my face in the morning.  I don't know if that is bad or good.  it felt like it was on top of my skin if that makes sense.

I did use this for five days and let me tell you, for $54 bucks the product goes fast.  Now for the ""but"".  First I got one pimple on my cheek.  Then I got one on the side of my face between my ear and eye.  Not happy since I haven't had a pimple in about a year.

Yes, the ingredients are impossible to read off the back of the bottle, tiny print on a clear background. It's not that hard to locate them online:

It has a light pleasant scent, good ingredients (other than the dimethicone, my personal opinion!) and even Paula Beguon recommends this right up there with her own products she sells. Make-up goes on smoothly over the top.

I am pretty sure that it was listed differently when I ordered. I received the CC cream as pictured. It is definitely a CC Cream/ Sunscreen and not a cleanser.

I am a huge fan of BB creams. However, I have not been able to find a CC cream that I like...until now. CC creams tend to be heavy on sunscreen and with my oily skin that often means breakouts and slick, greasy skin after wearing it for a few hours. I have tried about 8 different CC creams previously and had pretty much determined that I didn't like CC creams. Three things drew me into this La Roche Posay CC Cream to make me try it after so many CC cream fails: 1) the brand name - I have heard great things about La Roche Posay 2) Tone-correcting cream - I have very uneven skin and I am always attracted to tone correcting products 3) redness-prone sensitive skin  - My skin is very red and can be sensitive

When this CC cream arrived, I tried it immediately. It does have a slight sunscreen feel, but it is very, very light. I don't love the initial feel of putting it on my skin, but it is tolerable. What I really love is the great coverage that this CC cream gives you! It definitely evens out my skin tone and redness. It is also comparable to my favorite BB Cream/ Foundation in the amount of coverage. I recommend blending it well with a beauty blender or similar beauty sponge (there are some cheaper ones on Amazon that are comparable). After the cream is blended into my face, it does not feel heavy, sticky or yucky at all. I have been wearing it all day long and it does a decent job of staying put. It also does not make my skin greasy or break out. This is a huge change from all the other CC creams that I have tried!

I personally really love this product and I will continue to use it. I will note that it says to reapply every 2 hours and it is not sufficient enough if you are swimming or sweating. So, like most CC Creams, this can not be used as your sole sunscreen product. However, it is great for your typical everyday wear. I highly recommend trying it.","The only CC Cream I have tried that did not make my skin greasy, oily and break out!",1444953600,27.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E00UxI92L._SY88.jpg']

It's tough for me to find one that meets my criteria for mascara, actually I don't know that I have before this one in fact.  My criteria is that it a) doesn't melt off my face as soon as applying, I want it ON my lashes, not below my eyeballs.  b) doesn't make my eyes itch (my eyes are sensitive) c) makes my eyelashes look good.  While I realize that isn't a huge list it's really hard to find one that meets all three.  If it doesn't make my eyes itch, then it seems to melt off.  If it doesn't melt off, it makes my eyes itch or they just don't do anything and so forth.

The bonus to Butter London's Iconoclast is that the brush is really amazing.  It's a normal plastic brush for most of the wand but the end tip is a ball that lets you get in there to grasp the tiny lashes that can be troublesome to nab.

On the Lorac website, it mentions that Matte Tan is a good general bronzer if you're fair, and I definitely agree.  I wear MAC foundation in NW20, and the Matte Tan leaves a nice, soft color that looks really natural.

That being said, I think I love the Golden Glow color even more.  It leaves a pretty sheen to the skin, with no sparkles or glitter, which I've encountered in other bronzers.

My skin can sometimes be really dry so I was worried about using a powder bronzer, but it doesn't sink into dry spots.

To apply it, I use an S-motion, starting on my temple, sweeping down below my cheekbone, and then sweeping down to my jawline. I then apply a bit to the bridge of my nose, where the sun would naturally hit.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

As far as the actual pigment goes, it's a nice clean black with no hint of brownish or grayish tones.  However, the humongous applicator means that you are 100% more likely - or at least *I* am, I'm not the most graceful thing - to apply mascara to your eyelid and around the lash area instead of right onto your lashes.  I usually don't do this with the mascara that I use regularly, Physicians Formula.  And I thought the Physician's Formula applicator was huge!  I've uploaded a photo so that you can see the pretty dramatic difference between a normal large size applicator and this one.  You may notice how the Japonesque applicator has no transitional area at the base, just goes from wand to *poof* huge brush.  I definitely notice this when applying.  Probably wouldn't if the brush was a bit smaller.

Because of the size of the applicator, big giant chunks of mascara come off of it during any given application.  These of course either clump your lashes together (I made extensive use of my lash comb) or else fall off in plops on your cheeks or down on your outfit.

Because we all have a strange willingness to part with our hard earned money for some small exotic vial of fluid if it purports to make our skin more youthful and radiant. The magic allure seems to rise exponentially the more expensive the product is. I've heard of the Erno Laszio line of products but this was my first opportunity to use a skin emulsion first hand. While not a chemist or scientist, my first response is to consult the ingredients list to try to make some sense of exactly what's in there and the product's strategy to produce it's desired end. Often there's some type of exfoliating acid that's designed to help loosen and gently dislodge the outer layer of dead skin cells and I've had great success with several of those products, though this emulsion seems to use another strategy. With the help of Google, I surveyed the ingredients in this emulsion with some interesting results. There were numerous ingredients whose purpose is to make the product glide on evenly and smoothly as well as fill tiny superficial imperfections with substances such as silicone derivatives. But if my admittedly pedestrian understanding is correct, the two seemingly active ingredients designed to do the heavy lifting are basically rice starch and niacinimide. (Not to ignore the oleanolic acid which is found in olive leaves and supports among other things skin elasticity, but it is listed almost last in the list meaning it is one of the least abundant ingredients in the formulation)  First, do some homework regarding rice water and rice based skin benefits and you might be surprised at the effectiveness of this simple easily purchased and even more easily made at home ingredient. In the past I liked very much Dermalogica's Daily Microfoliant product and a little probing revealed it was largely rice based also. As an alternative, I experimented by purchasing, believe it or not, white rice flour on Amazon. A generous 24 oz size is only 14 dollars. I used it exactly as I used the Dermalogica Microexfoliant and it seemed to produce the same positive results. You use it with water to gently exfoliate and then allow it to dry on your face before rinsing off. It is highly effective in brightening your skin and evening skin tone, though don't expect dramatic results overnight. But with consistent use it is impressively effective. I may have seemed to stray off point, since I can report that using this Lazio Emulsion produced gradual skin tone evening and I noticed a definite improvement as well. Forgive the meandering discussion, but I wanted to give an alternative to purchasing such a spendy product. Rice water or rice flour isn't nearly as sexy as a high end cream, but it seems to get similar results with a basic ingredient.

Niacinamide is also known as vitamin B3. I won't create an unreadably long lecture on that ingredient though I encourage you to do some homework yourself online. It also offers impressive results and should be included in any skin care routine. Interestingly, it is readily available in products costing a relatively meager fifteen to twenty dollars.

My evaluation, therefore, is that this Erno Lazio is an excellent and effective product you should not be disappointed in purchasing and using regularly. There is the matter of it's high cost which for  many might make it a deal breaker. You can have similar results, though, I believe from my personal experimenting and first hand observation, by purchasing a Niacinamide serum and making or purchasing Rice water or even rice flower and using it as a gentle daily exfoliant and mask all at a small fraction of the cost. Conversely, if your budget allows, and your not interested in experimenting, this Erno Lazio Radiende Emulsion offers a simple solution and an effective recommended product. One star removed only for the high cost.",Its two seeming active ingredients Niacinamide and rice starch give impressive results. There is a low cost alternative as well.,1533427200,,

The polish comes in a cute bottle and looks very cool and funky -- we thought it would come out in a dark ebony color with sparkles throughout.  We were in for a huge surprise.

First we put the polish on her fingernails.  What a disappointment.  There are hardly any glitters or sparkle at all.  What we ended up with is a plain clear base coat that had hardly any sparkles showing.  Too bad, it looked so promising --

Then Paige had the idea to paint her toe nails with a pink polish and try putting the USLU AIRLINES POLISH on top of that -- maybe then the glitters and sparkles would show.  Nope, not even with a pink base coat.

We did apply a second coat and did manage to get a few sparkles on her thumb.  A little while later -- they came off!  Hmm -- certainly not worth the $16 asking price.  We have another glitter and sparkle nail polish that we purchased at a retail store for under two bucks.  And guess what?  It works fabulous, tons of glitter, tons of sparkle.

So, if you are looking for a base coat with hardly any glitter or sparkles showing up and want to throw sixteen of your hard earned dollars out the window, this is the product for you.

If you are sensible and like to get a bang for your buck, go to the nearest retail store and get some polish there for a much better product and a lot less cash.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself.

Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself.

This gave my face a whitish cast and it ""pilled"" when I tried to rub it in.  That means when I tried to rub this product in, it would actually rub off instead leaving what looks like the residue left over when you use an old fashioned eraser all over my skin.  This residue had to be brushed off which, in turn, tended to create even more residue.  This also left residue and white streaks all around my neck by the end of the day.  I would not purchase this product again.

Update: I ran out of my regular sunscreen and, in a pinch, had to make this one work.  I found that when this product is used alone, as in clean, dry, naked skin without any serums, primers, anti-wrinkle cream, make-up, etc, that it didn't pill and it was much easier to rub in.  Being able to rub it in well also eliminated the whitish cast that it previously left on my skin.

So, if you are at an age where you can get by with just a moisturizer, then this sun screen would be worth a try because, as sun screens go, it's pretty moisturizing.  However, if you need to layer products to address other skin issues then this isn't the sun screen for you.  Maybe someday they will make a moisturizing sun screen like this that does ""play well with other products"" or that is a multi-tasker, eliminating the need to slather on so many products.  Until then,  this is better suited to younger skin.  And, if you need to use acne products you younger folks might run into the same pilling issues when you try and layer the two.

The Scott-Vincent compact is sleek and I love the turn dial on this that allows you to grind and mix a fresh batch each time. I also can control the color a little better, I can tap out some of the white and that gives me a little darker color which is perfect as I need a shade between light and medium just to deal with the naturally dark eye circles I was cursed with. It says that it is a cream but it really is powdery, but stays. I'm a fan of mineral make up because yes, it does make your skin look smoother, does not have the heavy and drying feeling of wet foundations. And of course it it SPF 29 (but quite frankly all mineral makeups offer a degree of SPF protection.)

Tho' I have to admit, what really sets this product apart is the exfoliating application brush! What an amazing and beautifully made little brush, this feels like Heaven on my skin. I could just stroke this on my face all day and its like this amazing little message. When I went to Youtube to check out videos on the product (I was hoping to find out about using the mask, I will get to that next.) I found an HSN advert and was a bit dismayed to see the foundation retail for $24.00 dollars (with free shipping) of course halfway thru the video Scott-Vincent intros the Brush and it retailed separately for $25.00 (still not thrilled that Amazon retails this set at $78.00 when HSN sold them for $49.00 - but hey that's why we browse and compare, right?) But I will say that, YES! I would be perfectly happy to pay $25.00 for this Brush alone, it is quite simply the BEST makeup brush I have ever seen/used in my life and it cleans up beautifully. LOVE this Brush.

Now on to the weird part.

Along with the compact and brush came a mask. This is frankly the oddest gimmick I have as yet to encounter with foundation. The instructions included read as follows: ""To prep skin for even quicker skincare benefits, apply mask prior to first use. 1.) Brush white skin care side of foundation treatment on face. 2. Place moistened mask onto face for 5 minutes to enhance nutrient absorption into epidermis. 3. Use both sides of foundation treatment going forward.

Ummm - okay. This is why I went to Youtube and I did not find a video offering instruction on this part of the ""application"". So I winged it by following the above directions. It was odd at best, Since it is only really a one-time use deal there is not a whole lot of purpose for it. Second, maybe if I lived somewhere with some humidity it might not have been a big deal. But I am in Wyoming which is an arid desert state, my skin dried quickly and felt very dry and tight so I washed my face and tried again with my usual three step routine: 1. wash face. 2. apply moisurizer and 3. apply foundation. This was much more satisfactory.

I decided to play it safe and put on the Elemis Biotec Skin Night Cream on only at night. II actually just discovered that moisturizer helps when applying makeup but I didn't want it to be too much that my makeup slid off my face.

The first thing I noticed that it had two separate tubes inside the bottle. The green tube is the greasy oily part of the cream. The other side which is this thin whitish substance is the part that has the nutrients. Now, I believe that the two pumps you need to administer to your face and neck should mix the products together. However, it doesn't, First, the oily part gets pumped into my palm and then the whitish cream blobs out separately. Not only is this not eye appealing but now I have to blend it so I can properly apply it to my face. I am not sure if the bottle was created poorly that it doesn't mix together or it is intended not to mix but they don't explain anything to the customers. So after you deal with that mess, you apply it all over your face and neck which is easy with the two pumps of cream. It spreads easily and it was absorbed into my skin quickly.

I also found that it is wonderful for indoor lighting pictures, it photographs great under fluorescent light or flash pictures without your face looking lighter/grayish or ""ghost like"" when heavier makeup has been applied.

It is more of a light setting type of powder in comparison to a foundation powder, it leaves a smooth matte finish that lasts for me (I have dry skin and am 56 years old) for a good 6+ hours, my friend who (is 35 years old) has more oily skin, finds that her oils on her face tend to break through the powder at about 4/5 hours but  touch ups can easily bring it back to a fresh look in seconds. If you use a primer it will last  much longer than if /when you don't.

The sponge applicator that comes with it is great for touch ups but for the initial application I have others I prefer.

The verdict was that this concealer had a great color and conceals minor blemishes well.  I heard that both ladies that tried it liked the way it went on to their faces, and how other makeup could be used on top of the concealer.

While this concealer is a bit expensive, it is relatively reasonably priced as compared to many concealers you buy in makeup sections of high end department stores, and you get a relatively large amount of concealer.  I admit that ""large amount"" for me is like a gallon.  Apparently, makeup manufacturers believe in the theory that less is...well, less.  Or about the amount that you can use before the concealer dries out beyond the ability to use it.

Okay, so the color is fine, it applies well, it conceals minor blemishes with a smooth finish, and you get a goodly quantity.  It seems like this concealer is a good value and works for most people!

I found that Argan oil, which comes from the kernels of the argan tree, known as 'liquid gold' in Morocco, is a lightweight oil that can be used as a daily moisturizer for skin, hair, and nails. Capuacu butter is similar to cocoa butter, rich and creamy. The Jack Black Epic Moisture Extra Rich Body Hydrator is extra rich, but is NOT extra creamy. It is also not extra fragrant.

Plus, if you're using other cosmetic products  its always hard to know if this new product is solely responsible for any improvement.

Because of this, what I can say is whether or not something is irritating to the skin because thats important to know, especially if you have sensitive skin like I do. As to that, I can report back that this product is not irritating  which is great.

What is surprising about this product is that  I can report back after only 2 weeks of use that it is helping. I am able see an improvement, but only  to one particular part of my face - the smallish area above my upper lip.

At first I tried the product all over and it was so-so, But now If I use the product twice a day on the lines on the limited area over my upper lip it,  it actually helps. (Just remember, before you use this, clean the area by using either a lip sugar glazer and wiping it off or you use whatever else you want to use to make sure the area is very clean and any dead skin sloughed off.)

This has really helped puff up and helped the bleeding lines that sometimes show up on your upper lip when you put on lipstick or gloss and this is the first product that has done that. Mind you, the lines aren't completely gone, but there is an improvement.

On the negative side, if this product is applied too heavily (which isn't hard to do,) you can end up with it peeling/sloughing off - not a good look when you happen to look in the mirror.

Amazon inadvertently sent us the perfume to review instead of the milk, and as my girlfriend (and me) really like the fragrance we decided to keep it.

This product has been a refreshing change. Due to having migraines, asthma, and a VERY sensitive nose, my girlfriend is generally unable to wear most scents. With the BURBERRY Body Tender, Eau de Toilette, however, she found she could apply small amounts of it to places generally not near her face (on the small of her back, I believe), and it didn't cause any reaction.  She's pleased because she LOVES the Burberry fragrance and says it make her feel ""sexy"". I wholeheartedly agree with her assessment!

It has a subtle citrusy, floral scent that smells clean and fresh. Over time it seems to smell more like sandalwood and musk, but never too heavy. The scent lasts much of the day, though she says she will occasionally apply a bit more in the evening if we're going out.

The fragrance comes in an interesting, tall, narrow, octagonal pink/mauve box, and the bottle within is heavy glass in the same narrow octagonal design, with a silver cap. It looks very classy on a dressing table.

Overall a great, high quality fragrance from a premium brand, with the commensurate premium price, which is the only thing I'm critical of. It's Made in France, BTW.

After using these products for a month, I'm impressed ... for the most part. First, I should say that I have pretty good skin--I don't really get acne anymore, and my face tends more toward dry than oily. I'm also not sensitive or allergic to any products that I know of.

*Lemon-Sage Body Butter: I absolutely love the smell of this body butter! I also appreciate that it leaves my skin hydrated without feeling greasy. It's not as thick as some other body butters, so it doesn't just sit on top of the skin--it absorbs very easily. I get very dry legs during the winter, and this body butter has gone a long way toward softening my skin and reducing that dry skin itchiness.

*Fabulous Foaming Face Wash: I've been using this every day for nearly a month, and I like it. It doesn't dry out my skin at all, and a little bit goes a long way--I still have about 1/2 of the bottle left.

*Triple Oxygen Instant Energizing Mask: I love this mask! I just love the way it feels on my face with the bubbling :-) I don't know that it's doing much, but I love the feel!

*The LoveHandler: Honestly, this product strikes me as completely ridiculous. I don't believe for an instant that it's going to reduce my love handles. I wish that another face product or lotion had been included in this set instead.

I've been using it now for about a month (I wanted to give it time to work), and am impressed with how lovely this makes my skin.

When you first open the box it comes in, be sure to check the corner of the box for the small application spatula that is tucked away in a fold of the corner.  The spatula makes for a more hygienic application since you don't have to dip your fingers into the jar and risk the possibility of introducing bacteria into the cream.  (Of course, Paula Begoun mentions that skin creams and lotions should really be in tubes so that the product ingredients don't oxygenate and lose their potency; the spatula doesn't help avoid that issue, but at least it makes things more sanitary.)

I don't think that it has made my fine lines any less noticeable, but it helps alleviate the dryness and peeling that my Retin-A sometimes leaves in its wake.

Thermal water works wonders to balance the Ph of the skin, especially for sensitive skin. It can also be used to refresh the skin throughout the day. Some even use it to set their makeup because of the fine, even mist.
I keep mine in the refrigerator and use it first thing in the morning after washing my face. My son has very dry skin, he suffers from eczema, and loves to use it every few hours to add a bit of moisture and refresh the skin.
Ive tried several types of thermal water- Vichy, La Roche Posay, Avene- and the Evian is hands down my favorite; Ive been using it for about 8 years now. Its mostly due to the fact that Evians spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent, bottle after bottle.
The results from the other brands are practically identical, at least when it comes to its effect on the skin, but Evian is just more dependable. Theres no leaking from the nozzle, no uneven spraying, no clogs, and all the water gets used up.

Why I love this product:

* The heavenly texture. It is described as gel, but it is really more of a cream.  I guess thats why the word balm is in the name.  It just glides onto my skin.

* It works.  My skin feels moisturized, yet not greasy.  Even in the winter, when my skin is especially dry, it works.

* The pretty pink color.  The balm is a light pink, and its quite pleasing to the eye.  This really has nothing to do with how well it works, but it is a pleasure to put on this balm.

* The light, pleasing scent.  I have been disappointed with so many skin creams because of their heavy, artificial scent.  I never considered myself all that sensitive to scents until I started trying some of the other creams.

I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.

Lately, I've been going with the curlier look because it's getting more difficult to make my hair do what I want.  Enter this Obliphica curl control cream.  I disperse one pump throughout my hair (more on that later), and my hair is much more manageable and style-able.  The style holds throughout the day without any crunchiness or unsightly residue.  And I love the scent.

When I apply, I follow what my stylist does:  squirt a pump into my palm, pick up a bit with the fingertips from the other hand, rub it between them, and then apply by plucking two-thirds of the way up my hair to the ends.  When the cream is almost gone from my palm, I rub my two hands together and use what's on them to finish up.  I don't need to use more than that, although you may, especially if you have tightly curled hair.

I find that this curl control cream is best for, yes, controlling.  If I want to stay curly, it ends up relaxing the curls or weighing them down instead.  That's probably because I have that in-between kind of hair, neither straight nor truly curly.  It keeps the frizz under control, too.

When I use this cream and style with a brush and hair dryer, my hair keeps its body without fizz or unruliness.

I have sensitive dry skin.  I had tried this brand's serum and figured why not?  I don't have many signs of wrinkles yet but do have a few old acne scars, so a ""filling"" cream is something I'm willing to try even if that sounds like an unbelievable claim -- even if it benefits my skin in any way, it'd be worth trying.

This filler, however, not only didn't have any ""filler"" benefit but also left my skin angry.  At first it did feel like there was something to it... Run my hand over my face and it felt pretty smooth.  Felt tight.  That's always a good feature from anything you're putting on your face.  Within minutes it felt dry and itchy.

May be for some people but for me?  Something in it is not agreeing with my skin.  Any benefit that it might offer isn't worth the reaction I had to it.  There's no ingredient list on the bottle, so I searched them out...  not sure what is bothering my skin, but something is.

In recent years, the market seems to have been flooded with similar products at all price points but, with the exception of several free samples from the Japanese company DHC, I've still never bothered to pick one up.  I usually remove my eye make-up with Cetaphil and cleanse the rest of my face with an exfoliating product, so I've never felt the urge to stray from what works for me.  But since this was being offered as a free trial, I figured why not?

When it arrived, I immediately opened it and squirted a bit on my fingers.  My first impression was that it reminded me a bit of baby oil - the fragrance and consistency.  Very different than the DHC oil which was light and almost odorless.  Not off to a good start.  However, once activated with water the oil easily emulsified into a thin, slippery fluid and created a low grade lather that felt nice and rinsed easily.  My skin felt smooth, firm and moisturized afterward.  I was sold.

Everything blends so well (I have fair skin that can look clownish easily) and never causes breakouts on my sensitive skin.

This is a GREAT bronzer. When I ordered it, I didn't realize it was really targeted to contouring, but it didn't make a difference. I've now used it as both... a light natural bronzer just dusted on my cheeks and forehead, and for more dramatic contouring.

It comes with three shades of bronzer. The one with the most gold (far left) is the only one with shimmer, in case you are trying to avoid that for daytime or winter use. The bottom stick that looks like an applicator is actually a highlighting stick. It works best on my browbones... the yellow tone doesn't quite match my undertones enough to use it on my nose, even though I'm a neutral.

Kardashian fans take note... this is not dark enough to give you tiger stripes. Which is just fine by me. It's natural and would work for probably my tone (quite fair, but not true porcelain) and darker. I'm also getting to the age of larger pores, but the built in primer keeps this VERY smooth and it didn't settle in them at all. It's also really easy to blend - one night I went a little heavy and had no problem smoothing it to something more believable.

One thing I love about the compact - it's reusable. You can slide out the colors when you are done and refill it with other butter LONDON makeup. I'm happy about this because it's a super cute compact, even though it will be a long time before I use it up.

It does come with instructions, but if you are new to contouring, I'd suggest looking it up on Pinterest instead. In my experience, every face shape should contour differently.","Another butter LONDON product to love - smooth, natural-looking and sensitive!",1468540800,,

I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.

But it's pricey, and I only get a chance to go once every few years. I love what the mud does for my skin, making it soft and luxurious feeling. So the experience of even a simple mud mask is relaxing to me, and that's why I ordered this product--for the spa-like feel, and for the skin care.

I love that this mud comes in a pre-cut mask that  I can easily apply to my own face. I wasn't sure how that was going to work out in terms of surface coverage, but it really is awesome.

The mud comes preloaded on something akin to cheesecloth. It is precut for the upper and lower face. Applying it is really easy, and I was able to get full coverage over my entire face.

I could feel a slight tingle as soon as the mask touched my face. And that slight tingle continued the entire time I had the mask on. It wasn't painful or irritating. On the contrary, I drew myself a hot bath, put my head back and feet up, and let the mask do its work for a good 30 minutes (the directions indicate a minimum of 10 minutes, but it just felt so relaxing!

I'm not able to describe scent from the mud on the mask except to say that it reminds me of the spa--clean plus something else that I rather enjoy.

Removing the mask was simple. And, as it doesn't dry out completely, it was painless. It was also virtually mess free.

And best of all, I really can see improvement in minimizing my poors. My face also feels softer and smoother than before I applied the mask.

The primary difference between the premium brands and the common ones is generally found in the ingredient list.  If you showed me this Erno Lazlo ingredient list without telling me what the product was, I'd swear that this was Olay.  It contains everything that women are trying to avoid these days:  silicone, petroleum products, and parabens.  That said, those do condition skin, except for those who have developed sensitivity to those ingredients.  In an expensive cream, though, I look for ingredients that are gentler on my skin while still providing moisture and care.  At least the fragrance is not overbearing and is more in line with an expensive product.

Despite my disappointment with the ingredients, this cream does indeed moisturize.  Like most night creams, this one is thick and white.  It goes on smoothly (thanks in part to silicone), and, while it requires a bit more blending than a lighter day cream might, it absorbs fairly quickly.  Use it sparingly -- you don't need a lot.  I love that it comes with a little plastic scoop to keep my fingers out of it.  Even though it is preserved with parabens, you don't want to introduce bacteria that could turn it prematurely.

Spherical tips don't seem to be very common (And I can understand why because it was a little weird at first and I probably wouldn't have picked it up and experimented with it without the coaxing of a makeup artist who raved about it.) so I was curious to see how this would perform since I've already had great experience with other makeup products from butter LONDON.

So far I'm in love.  The brush was a little wet and overloaded with product when I first opened the mascara so I wiped it on a lint-free cloth, as I've done with another mascara and it fixed the problem.  After completely cleaning the brush of the existing product, dipping it back in and starting over I got just the perfect amount of mascara.

I LOVE that sweeping this on my lashes gives them volume and length without being spidery or clumping.  And the ball tip is perfect for getting the small lashes in the inner and outer corners of my eyes as well as going back over anything to make sure every stray millimeter of lash is covered.

I also think it wears well.  I don't notice it flaking or smudging off on my face even though it's quite humid and hot here in Chicago right now and I also commonly wear eye makeup to my hour-long workouts where I am sweating profusely.  It also removes pretty easily with my Sephora brand makeup remover and a cotton round, which is nice because some mascaras can cling on so tight I find myself losing lashes when removing it.

This waterproof-makeup remover is the latest in my arsenal. I don't often use waterproof mascara or eyeliner, but when I do, I want it to come off easily and cleanly. I feel the same way about any type of eye and lash makeup, waterproof or not. I don't want to use any product that requires me to rub the delicate skin around my eyes. This cleanser removes the makeup easily and effectively, without irritating skin or eyes.

You'll see from the product photo that the product is two-tone (blue at the top and lighter below). This is not color on the bottle -- there are two parts to the product that don't naturally mix, so you have to shake the bottle each time you use it. I dab a little on a cotton ball, wipe one eye area turn the cotton ball to the clean side, and wipe the other eye. Some say they have to use a lot of product to get their makeup off. Not me. I get enough on the cotton ball to make it uniformly damp, and that is all I need.

I have sensitive eyes, so the fact that this cleanser doesn't sting, is a must for me.

Some others said they thought the price was high. For me, $20 for a good-size bottle, makes it an inexpensive product. When it's my eyes and sensitive facial skin at stake, I'll spend a little money. We're worth it, right ladies?

The gloss color is subtle and nicely shiny.  It works a little better for cool-toned complexions than warm-toned complexions.  Staying power is average.

My major objection is the applicator design where the sponge thing must be shoved back into the liquid after being used.  That can't be a good idea, microbe-use, for a liquid product, and effective shortens the life span of the gloss to the same as for mascara.

The modular design seems good as a concept, but it makes individual glosses or shadows look weird when they are solo instead of locked in with their buddies for a portable palette.

The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me.

You may find this cream useful if you have a cut or scratch. Your skin will heal much faster than normal. I noticed this before I really looked at the ingredients.

The addition of ""allantoin/Comfrey Root Extract"" is significant and explains why this heals the skin so fast. Allantoin is said to produce an increase in leukocytes/white blood cells that help to ward off infection.

Skin will regenerate faster and pain is also relieved. This cream is perfect for skin irritations, chapping, cracking of the epidermis and wounds that are slow to heal.

This is a product I don't want to live without! You can also use it on your face as a healing spot treatment or on your cuticles if they feel dry. It is a good all-purpose, skin healing formula that will impress.

Based on the description that mentions citrus and floral notes, I was excited about trying Josie by Josie Natori. I tend toward light fragrances - mostly one-note florals. While I enjoy musk tones on others, I don't care for them in my own fragrance choices.

I find Josie to be too heavy, musky and cloying. It smells ""old lady"" sweet to me and even though I may be an old lady, I don't want to smell like one. ;-) It does become less cloying after an hour or so and it isn't what I would call unpleasant. It's just too much for my taste.

However, to illustrate how highly personal fragrance preferences are, my daughter and one son adore this scent! Both of them have raved about how fabulous I smell when wearing this. Go figure.

I would say that if you enjoy long-lasting scents that are complex, musky and have sweet floral and citrus notes, you may love Josie. If you prefer lighter, one-note scents that aren't musky, this probably isn't the scent for you. But you never know - try some at a fragrance counter!

It is an interesting fragrance combination of fresh and floral that works really well together and can be playful, sophisticated, and feminine all at once. Meaning...it can be worn day to night and on the weekends, too. It's got high notes that remind me of breezy linen freshness over a sweet floral body. One does not overpower the other and doesn't give me or my husband headaches. And it doesn't have any low notes like musky, woodsy, or spicy aromas pulling it down.

Some complain that this perfume doesn't last long but in my experience I think perfumes that don't have the low notes seem to not last as long because it's usually the musk, woods, and spices that really cling after the high notes other smells fade. This is not a problem for me at all and I actually think this perfume fades to a really nice floral scent that is pretty and super soft.

As a body moisturizer? I liked it a lot, despite the thickness of the cream (apply lightly and then add more if you like).

It's November in Seattle and we've not much sunshine these days, so I can't test it or comment on that aspect of the product at this time.

Loose Setting Powder, Cool Beige'}",Mrs. B,"I should begin by saying that my review likely would have been different if I had got the translucent color instead of Cool Beige. I loved the product itself, but really disliked the color of Cool Beige.

Application: This setting powder comes in a standard 1oz plastic jar. The lid screws off and there are holes to allow you to sift the powder out a bit at a time. It came with a fuzzy applicator puff but I felt like that was wasting a lot of product so I switched to my usual brush. The directions say to apply liberally and buff off after letting it set for 2 minutes. Unfortunately, the Cool Beige tint of the powder really darkened my foundation (currently using Dermablend mousse foundation) in uneven patches so I was unable to use as directed. When applying just a tiny amount with my brush and quickly blending I could minimize the darkening and prevent the splotching effect. I was really surprised that it darkened my foundation as much as it did and in such an uneven way. I have used tinted setting powder before and my skin is not at all pale. For reference, I wear an NC35 in MAC.

Wear: After I got over the quirk of it darkening my foundation, I was pleased with how it extended the wear of my foundation. It gave a nice matte look without looking or feeling dry. My skin stayed fairly oil and smudge free for over 16 hours. I expect the results may have been even more favorable if I was able to apply generously as directed. Once I get through the Cool Beige, I will repurchase in the translucent color and update my review.",Be careful about getting the tinted powders- they darken your foundation,1500595200,,

It came with two brushes but the normal brush wasn't gentle enough for me, so I started using the Sensitive brush and exclusively used that style for more than nine years with great results. Notably, I've tried the Radiance and Cashmere brushes more recently, and they also feel comfortable to my sensitive skin (especially Cashmere) and produce great results as everyday brushes too. But the Sensitive brush is what I've used most and has served me well as an everyday brush for many years. I do vaguely recall an initial adjustment period of break outs when I first started using my Clarisonic and that I worked up to twice daily use, but the Sensitive brush is a comfortable brush for my skin and has never caused any skin irritation.

I've noticed a big improvement in how my skin looks and feels using the Clarisonic with a Sensitive brush head. My skin definitely gets cleaner and looks brighter and clearer than when I wash by hand or have tried other cleansing gadgets, my dry skin absorbs my serums and creams better so it stays more hydrated and my fine lines look less noticeable, and my skin texture feels much smoother and softer especially when I use my Clarisonic with quality serums and creams.

I turned 40 this past year and am definitely feeling the lure of products that promise younger looking skin, so I looked forward to trying this product.

First, I would definitely suggest watching the video which demonstrates use of the trainer rather than just relying on the written instructions (there is a website for the video in the product manual).  For three weeks, I've been taking the time to use the NuFace trainer as directed.  As long as I have the right amount of gel coverage, there is no sensation.  However, I also don't see noticeable results.  I will continue to use the kit as directed and am being a bit generous with the rating just in case long term use is the key.  I plan to update my review accordingly if after a longer period of time I still see no difference.

Although the video shows use of attachments, this kit doesn't come with those parts -- and they cost a pretty penny.  If you already have signs of aging that you want to minimize, I'd suggest sticking to a good skin care routine and trying an over the counter anti-aging cream.

In my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. The lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. Most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. Chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.

The directions are simple. Apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. Then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. Make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. Once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.

Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.

I will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and I do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The dying lotion is a good product, but it's not a miracle. Set your expectations reasonably, and you should be fine.",Mario Badescu Drying Lotion,1473638400,3.0,

The website also states that if your product is going to be replaced under warranty, you should send it to them first (it does not say who will pay for it), and they will mail you another one withing three weeks.  I seriously dislike all this kinds of tricks.
Aside from being broken now, the iron looks very attractive. The cable is long and swivels easily so it will not be tangled up with use.

ADORABLE

Color: Pale peachy nude. It is actually lighter than my natural lip color.

Swatch accuracy: I did not find the color swatch on the Amazon product page to be accurate for this color. The swatch makes the color look a good bit darker than it actually is.

Finish: Matte. I detect no shimmer, sparkle or glossiness in this color.

Feel: Quite smooth and not tacky or sticky. A little drying over time.

Fragrance: A moderate crayon-like scent. Not perfumy.

PARAMOUR

Color: Wine/pomegranate. For me, the color appears darker in the stick than on my lips, but then my lips may be more pigmented than the average.

Swatch accuracy: I found the color swatch on the Amazon product page to be fairly accurate for this color. However, as noted above, it appears lighter on my lips than what it appears in the stick.

Finish: Matte. I detect no shimmer, sparkle or glossiness in this color.

Feel: A bit tackier than and not as smooth as Adorable. More drying.

Fragrance: A mild crayon-like scent. Not perfumy.

GENERAL:

Made in the USA.

Twist-up crayon-type application but with rounded vs. pointed tip.

Easy to apply accurately.

Considered long wear (but I'm not sold on that yet).

As a ""woman of a certain age,"" I find that these lip colors (esp. the darker colors), when worn alone (without gloss), show every line in my lips. I love their easy application and petite size for carrying in my purse, but prefer to wear gloss over them (or lip balm under them) for comfort and added moisture.

3 stars when worn alone.
4 stars when worn with gloss or balm.

Certainly not offensive, but also not particularly sensual or romantic, at least not for me.

I would say it is medium-body, certainly not heavy and maybe a little on the lighter side.

It's half-life is about 4 hours or so; in other words, I can still smell it on her after a full day, but it's only about 1/4th as strong.

I would say it tends older, i.e. 30s and up.  My teen daughter characterized it as ""musty flowers"" and while she thought it was okay, it wasn't something she found special or would wear regularly.

Overall I would say this is a good, basic scent that is just fine but nothing special or head-turning.  If that's what you want, it could be perfect for you.  If you want something a little spicy or musky or daring, this is probably not the one.",Got this for my wife ...,1425859200,,

I have a totally unscientific and brute force way to test potency of glycolic (or vitamin c) products: put a dab on a fresh shaven inner thigh. If it burns, it definitely has potency. This cream burned, OUCH!  (I washed it off that area immediately).

As for usage, the instructions are on the box, so keep it! (They are so short, they really should be on the jar). You are to leave it on feet or elbows 10-15 minutes, then rinse off. However, I use the instructions on dermatologist Cynthia Bailey's web site: use pumice stone after showering, apply cream, and wear socks for eight hours. Here's a little time and hand saver: wash hands, after applying cream (you must) and pumice stone at the same time. Two washings in one. And the pumice stone is much more easily cleaned sooner than later after use.

The result? Noticeable softening of rough skin on feet! Expect an improvement as early as after the first use and even more after 3-5 uses. I am using it every other day for a week, then a week off, then back to every other day, etc. Not exactly, but something like that.

I usually am skeptical about products such as this from somewhere other than a dermatologists' office or authorized brand dealer, but in this case, I'm pretty sure it's the real thing. Also it has an expiration date (some products don't) and the day was way out, not  anytime soon.

It claims to purify skin, soothe skin, eliminate dirt and pollutants, mattify skin, leave skin feeling soft and clean, and reduce pore size with regular use. Vichy also claims that it is safe for sensitive skin. Aloe Vera and Allantoin are the soothing ingredients. I have very sensitive skin with effectively no barrier. Ive had bad reactions to clay masks in the past and have found them too drying, but I gave this one a try, because the ingredients seemed mild, and the instructions said to leave the mask on for only 3-5 minutes. It should not dry on your skin. The clay is fine-textured and gray. It goes on in a thin layer, so a 2.54 oz (75 ml) jar will last a long time. Vichy recommends to use it 1-2 times per week, concentrating on the T-zone area or wherever your pores tend to clog. Rinse off with water.

I started with a small area to make sure I wasn't going to react to the mask. I ended up using it on my whole face. I left the mask on for about 6 minutes, and it was dry in spots. It dries quite quickly. I can confirm Vichys claim that this mask works with sensitive skin. I didn't have any problems with it. I was a little concerned that my skin would react to the fragrance, which I have seen described as a light scent of mint and woody amber. I don't smell the mint, but I would describe the scent as an amber with woody notes. Its musky, and I think there are some florals in there. It does not seem light when the mask is smeared on my face, in close proximity to my nose. I found the scent unpleasant after a while. Its too strong for a mask, and the musky-floral mlange is an odd choice.

I was most interested in the masks pore-clarifying properties. It removed about half of blackheads and performed less well on smaller oil deposits that were not oxidized. I assessed the results in a 10X magnifying mirror, which is scary but essential to see how skin care products are working and to distinguish between a blackhead and a freckle. My Coui Nourishing Cleansing Oil does a better job on the oil deposits. A fine-grained scrub removes both blackheads and other oil deposits. The Vichy Pore Purifying Clay Mask did leave my skin feeling smoother than it began, but not as smooth or soft as Im accustomed to when I do a facial treatment. Ive used other mud masks that worked better on blackheads and oil but proved too harsh for my skin. So there is a trade-off. If you have sensitive skin and like masks, this one is probably safe. There are more effective alternatives, however.

I've used various StriVectin products before, namely the advanced wrinkle reducer. It was OK - not the best and not the worst, but definitely something I wouldn't pay a ton of money for. The StriVectin SD is different than the previous wrinkle reducer. This one specifically names stretch marks as one of its targets, leading me rightly to believe it is stronger than products made specifically for the face.

Good thing my skin is tough, so to speak. I don't easily break out or react badly to products that might bring on a rash or worse in someone with more sensitive skin. I tried the SD concentrate on my neck for those ring-like lines you get when you hit your 30s (my mother used to say it was like counting the rings on a tree trunk to tell its age!)

I was pleasantly surprised. The SD concentrate DID make a difference. The lines, after several weeks of use, are definitely less noticeable. But having said that, I'd also warn the sensitive of skin to be careful with this product. I didn't use it on my face (I'm full to the gills with anti-aging and wrinkle creams and serums!), but I did notice a slight flush on my neck where I used the StriVectin. The color disappeared after several days, but it was noticeable. I'd fear what this cream would do to the facial complexion, it IS that strong.

Because this is well under the manufacturer's suggested time with the product, this review only covers my first experience with the NuFace itself, not its effectiveness.

PROS

BUILD QUALITY: Other reviewers have complained about the build quality of the NuFACE, but I think it's quite nice and, as a designer, I have a pretty high bar. Granted, it looks a bit like a frog, but overall it's quite nice.

ERGONOMICS: The NuFACE feels good in the hand.

CONS

CHARGING LIGHT: Why oh why do products intended for bedrooms and bathrooms insist on bright, blue lights? Studies show that blue light triggers the brain to wake up. The light the NuFACE emits while charging is bright enough to illuminate my entire (rather large) master bathroom. I really don't need a ""Facial Trainer"" to be the most prominent thing in my bathroom. Nor do I need it to trigger me to wake up every time I make a midnight pitstop. Silly and unnecessary.

UNCOMFORTABLE: This isn't the most comfortable treatment. You'll feel a mild sting throughout the process. And if you have a problem with acne, forget about it. I've noticed that even the slightest facial blemish, scratch, or sunburn is irritated, rather profoundly, but the electrical current given off by the NuFace.

I've never used a 3/4 inch before.  It took forever to curl my hair.  But my curls were tighter and they gave me more curl and volume at the root.

This is my first time trying the Vinylux polishes.  It isn't as shiny and awesome as the first day but it doesn't look as horrible as regular polish does by day 10 (if you still have any on by day 10). It dries very quickly and is very shiny the first 4-5 days and not bad day 6-8. I don't know what would happen if I just applied another coat of clear polish around day 5. Maybe I will try that next time. I really like it because I can wear a color for a week but I don't have to wear it for two weeks to justify the cost. It goes on like regular polish so you don't have to go to a salon and pay $30-40 to have it done. Once it's dried it does feel thicker than regular polish but not in a bad way. It feels like it helps to make my nails stronger. I use my hands a lot at work and I wear gloves 20-30% of the time, I do a lot of typing, I wash dishes 3-4 times a week so if it was going to chip there were plenty of opportunities.

Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O.

That's because I cannot replicate it's original fine point. The sharpener that came with it does a poor job -- the usual breaking of the ""lead"" in this pencil, which results in a dollar's worth of loss each time.

Perhaps better attention should have been paid to the selection of wood or better quality control in actually testing the product on the sharpener attached.  It seems that the original manufacturing process produces a point that might not be available to the average consumer. Disappointed!

---------

I must admit, when I first selected this as a Vine product I thought to myself, ""Who would pay $20 for an eyebrow pencil?""  Now I'm wondering if I should stock up.

How does this compare to other high-end pencils? I cannot say; I have little patience in navigating the very expensive department store brands.  I can favorably compare this Vincent Longo pencil, however, to the more expensive drug-store options from L'Oreal and Revlon: They are generally half the price but also half the length (or less) and half the quality.

Here are the things I like about this pencil:

1. The color is ""blonde.""  Even though my hair is mid-to-dark brown, I learned long ago to use an eyebrow shade much lighter than my hair; ""blonde"" is usually best. (A small quibble: I would have preferred an even lighter blonde, but that's a personal preference.)

2. The point is very fine (yet not vulnerable to breaking, as with the drugstore versions). This means you truly can sketch the small lines that emulate eyebrow hairs instead of drawing on a big blob of color.

3. The compound's consistency  means it has staying power. No running or ""migrating.""  It also adds a little body so that you when brush the brow, everything stays where it's supposed to.

Therefore, it's super hard to find makeup that works for me, and I have given up on cheap brands and just stuck with Lancome over the years for my foundations (which is also not a perfect match, I have to use a blend of two!)  As a corrector stick, this works pretty darn well. The color is obviously not as good as an actually color matched concealer, but that's one thing nice about concealer... it doesn't have to be exact because you put it under your final coat of makeup and blend it in.  This dark beige worked just fine on me. I think the lighter one would still be a tad better, but I just ordered it so we will see.

Quality and use is PERFECT.  The stick worked just fine for me, you just take the lid off and twist the base to make it come out. The thickness was PERFECT, and others complaining about the brush are just goofy... it's IDEAL for laying in the concealer in the corner of my eye and under; and I use my fingertips to brush it out and blend it in. It's really perfect. Usually just one dose of it is about right for highlighting the area around my eye and getting rid of dark circles. And I have a TON of dark circles right now due to a new baby with health issues, so I know it works!!

The makeup is awesome, nice, thick and creamy and applies wonderfully. It is ""wet"" but does not shine at all, very matte without looking cakey.

I usually follow this routine: Lancome's La Base primer (it's amazing!), Lancome's liquid Teint foundation, then I use a highlighter for cheeks, this concealer around the eye corner, and touch up with Lancome's dual finish powder foundation and blush.

It also does contain the tiniest amount of sparkle, but it is not in any way ""glittery"". (Glitter isn't something I want on my 60+ skin.)

 It applies smoothly and evenly. (Note: it doesn't come with a brush, so use a nice, big fluffy blush-brush of your own for best results.) The color also stays true throughout the day, and doesn't morph into something different than what you first applied.

The narrow compact opens easily, and has a mirror which, despite its small-ish size, allows a good view of the entire face. (The compact can also be attached to other Jouer products, via a ""snap-together"" system.)

So before I used the NuFACE I spent a few days stepping up my beauty routine.  I masqued, exfoliated, biore-d, derma-rolled, and moisturized my face to get it looking its best.  Then I asked my husband and my daughter to take a good look at my face under bright lights before and after.

NOTE:  The NuFACE facial trainer is not meant to reduce wrinkles so much as it is meant to brighten, tighten, and fill out the face for an overall more youthful appearance.  Though many people have noted a reduction in wrinkles, that is more what the LED attachment (not included) is for.  If you have seen med spa advertisements for a ""lunchtime face lift,"" they are talking about microcurrent facials.

The NuFACE is easy to use.  You just put a thin coat of the gel on your face, power it up, set it to your desired strength 1-5, and you are off.  My skin is not sensitive.  I started out on 3 but bumped it up to a 5 almost immediately.  When I did it near my jawline I had a slight metallic taste in my mouth, and sometimes I could feel the electricity but it wasn't even strong enough to be called a mild shock.  It felt like a gentle,  rapid tapping and was by no means unpleasant or painful in the slightest.  Most of the time I didn't feel anything at all but the smooth metal balls gliding over my skin.  It is easy to get the timing right but no big deal if you don't.  For problem areas you can even hold it on one spot on your face for awhile without moving it.

I did half my face then asked my daughter to compare.  She quickly guessed which side I had done, stating that my skin looked better.  I personally noticed a bit of a brow lift.  When my husband came home that evening I asked him to take another look at my face and he said he could tell a difference as well.  I also took before and after pictures, and can tell a difference.  I have used it for three days now.  It is really easy to work into my routine.  I just wash my face in the morning, do the NuFACE for about 5 minutes, wipe the gel off, and go on about my day.

I decided to do some research on microcurrent as a beauty treatment, and found that it has been around for many years and popular with the Hollywood set.  The level of electricity mimics what is present in the human body anyway, though that decreases with age, so it is completely safe for most of us.  People with pacemakers should not use it, people with thyroid issues should avoid the thyroid area, and everyone should avoid using it on the chest area to avoid getting your heart out of rhythm.  Microcurrent started out as a medical treatment as a pain therapy and also to help people suffering from palsy or stroke to lift their drooping facial muscles back in place.  It stimulates your body to produce more collagen and more amino acids, both which lead to a more youthful and lifted appearance.  If you read unbiased reviews such as by users on YouTube, etc., you will see that pretty much everyone loves it.  The NuFACE is not as strong as the ""lunchtime face lift"" microcurrent treatments advertised by med spas, but that just means it takes longer to see the full effect, not that they are less effective.  And five minutes at home each morning is easier, less time-consuming and less expensive than med spa treatments twice a week for six weeks, which is the recommended start up treatment, with less frequent follow-up treatments thereafter.  NuFACE does not interfere with facial injections such as Botox or Juvederm, though you should not use any microcurrent treatment for about two weeks after having the injections.  After that it is business as usual, and there is some evidence that microcurrent actually makes the injectables last longer and helps to reduce the amount needed.

Yes, the NuFACE is expensive and is not for everyone.  However, if you have been tempted by the ""lunchtime face lifts"" or regularly get med spa treatments, or are just really not pleased with the signs of aging on your face and are willing and able to invest that kind of money, NuFACE is an excellent way to bring back some of the youthful skin tone, fullness and tightness.  It is a hefty initial investment, but check out the unbiased reviews for yourself, do your own research, and figure you can spend that cash now for a piece of equipment you can use quickly and easily in your own home for years, or you can get a handful of spa treatments that will last at the most a few months.",Med spa technology at home,1438300800,271.0,

Not so with this Obagi Nu-Derm Clear Fx.  After two weeks, the milia are disappearing and cropping up elsewhere.  This suggests that the lotion is clogging my pores with the dead skin cells it is supposed to remove.  I can live with the milia on a short-term basis.  My feeling is, though, that an expensive product shouldn't do this.

In terms of brightening my skin and evening the tone, it does seem to have had an effect, albeit with some side effects.  I'm not a fan of the three different parabens in the formula (parabens are used as preservatives), but at least it doesn't contain dimethicone.  You do need to be careful with the sun.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

Their quality is on the middling side of high-end skin care, which is to say they are good, but IMHO, probably not worth the price they charge.  I have never been so overwhelmed by their products as to purchase them full size, but if I received a sample, I'd probably use it if a favorite moisturizer, serum, or other skin care product was unavailable.

That being said, this mask was one of the more unusual ones I've seen in any line. I'm surprised that no one has thought of it sooner. The delivery system is nifty. A turn of the top and you roll on the proper portion of the gel-like mask to take care of your skin for the evening.

I'm in the age bracket, though, where I'm always interested in any product that will tighten up my epidermis, so this mask was of particular interest.

I haven't used it quite a month, but so far, I can say I notice a minimal lifting effect.

My first impression on seeing the packaging was, wow! It looked like it contained a jar the size of my Bare Minerals Foundation. That seemed like a lot of product. I soon realized that I was mistaken as the jar takes up only about .75% of the box. The box is made with interior walls that hold the smaller jar in place. It disappoints me when I buy a package that seems to hold a good amount, and find that in fact, there is mostly air or excess packaging. I don't see the point of having the much larger package. The jar is attractive, but the lid is nearly as big as the jar itself, which I also think leads the purchaser to ""see"" a larger amount than is actually provided. This is intentional and very common, no matter what we are purchasing. A lot of time and effort is put forth to make us feel we are getting more than we actually get. The jar is pleasing to look at however, and the lid fits snugly. I keep my cosmetics in a small basket and I have no concern about the lid coming off when this is tossed in with the rest.

The product itself is good in my opinion. When I first touched it, it did feel a little clay like, and was not the soft creamy texture I expected. I used the handle tip of a small brush to take a small amount of the product out of the jar, and placed it on the back of my hand, because I prefer to apply and blend make up with my fingers. When applied, the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Invisible Corrective Concealer Anti-Wrinkle CC Cream is much softer and lighter than I expected it to be. I use a dusting of foundation over it and it works great. Now, I don't have very dark circles under my eyes, but it is a little darker there than I would like. It also covered a small blemish that popped up recently. Bottom line is that I do like this product, and for me, it does a nice job. I am very pleased. My eye area does look brighter when I use this.","Spendy, but effective.",1430352000,,

I use this every morning. I apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. My face feels much smoother and softer. I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. This product is expensive, but well worth the money. Only a very small amount is needed.

The Bombshell rod does heat up quck - we are talking 30-45 seconds. It also features my favorite thing - auto shut-off. I believe that every curling rod and flat iron should have this feature.

The glove that is included is amazing and I use it all the time, even when I flat iron my hair to hold it off my neck and other hair until it cools down.

The curls that it creates are (depending on how you hold it I guess) tighter at the bottom and looser at the top - this gives the bottom section some room to loosen up and still have some tightness to them. I prefer my curls to be more uniform from top to bottom.

Puret Thermale 3 in 1 Micellar Solution and three .5 oz sample sizes of the Pore Purifying Clay Mask (for purifying), Quenching Mineral Mask (for hydration) and Double Glow Peel Mask (for dullness). I consider my skin dry and sensitive, and I'm really pleased with the Micellar Solution and Clay Mask while the other two masks don't seem well suited for my skin.

The Micellar Solution is wonderful, and I've grown to like it more over time. One of the first things I do when I get home after work is wet a cotton pad or cotton balls with the Micellar Solution and wipe my face. It's a quick and easy way to remove my makeup, cleanse and refresh my skin. The amount of makeup and grime left on the cotton pad is astonishing. This product feels gentle and contains no soap, colorants, oil or alcohol. It does list fragrance as an ingredient, but I really can't smell it. This is a great product.

I've tried all three masks. I'm impressed with how the Clay Mask makes my face feel. I apply a thin layer and rinse just before it's dry. My skin seems to soak the moisture right out of this mask for some reason, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, fresh and extra clean. It also seems to soften white gunk in my clogged pores by my nose, though it doesn't remove it. But I then focus on those pores with my Clarisonic and the mask seems to help get rid of the gunk. I'm very pleased with the Clay Mask.

The Quenching Mineral Mask makes my skin itch, so I haven't continued to use it. Denatured alcohol is a main ingredient, and I'm guessing but I don't think it agrees with my dry skin. It just doesn't feel good to me, even though it should given that it's for hydration. The Double Glow Peel Mask is an AHA face scrub that should gently exfoliate. But it makes my sensitive skin feel like it's burning, and I need to rinse it off. Denatured alcohol is the second ingredient, so I think the mask is likely too drying for my skin. Overall, I do think this is a nice gift set even though only two of four products work well for me. 3.5 stars (rounded to 4 stars).",Impressed With The Micellar Solution And Clay Mask Though The Other Two Masks Don't Suit My Dry Sensitive Skin,1504310400,,

I am a bit surprised to find that this hair gel has received so many negative reviews - overwhelmingly 1 or 2-star reviews (as of the writing of this review). That has not been my experience using this product for a few days, however, I do not have the history with Jack Black Hair Gel that some other reviewers do.

My ""go-to"" hair styling product for the last several years has been American Crew Forming Cream. That product strikes a good compromise between styling hold and control and avoids hard, stiff hair a.k.a. helmet head. It is, however, a bit pricey so I am always on the lookout for other products with similar performance at a cheaper price. I think Jack Black Building Hair Gel is that product even if the savings are marginal.

I've worn this product two days; both days work days where I keep my hair neat and tidy. The product has performed great! The gel is clear, definitely fruity smelling (no surprise there), and holds my hair while not giving me hard, stiff hair. The Jack Black definitely is stiffer than my American Crew forming cream but nothing like the cheap drugstore gel of my youth. Honestly any stiffer and you might as well buy a tub-o-gel (in neon blue) from the drugstore.

I found that styling my (short) hair was as easy as the forming cream I use. The Jack Black product held my hair throughout the day without issue. So for me this is definitely a product that I would purchase and use again.

I did deduct one star for the following reasons:
 Stiffness: Simply compared to the American Crew product I regularly use.
 Smell: I'm not a fan of the fruity smell of the product when first putting it on. It's not noticeable after a few minutes but definitely perceptible at first.",Good Alternative to American Crew Forming Creams & Pomade,1436918400,,

*******************
Original review:
Warning...spray lightly. You can always spray more if desired. When I first tried this, I sprayed too much.  It was strong & gave me a  mild headache.

I know that fragrance can smell completely different on one person than another.
BURBERRY Weekend has a fresh, floral scent on me.
After about 3 hours, the floral scent had a bit of spice to it; later, as the scent was wearing off, it became a light, powdery, floral scent.
After about 6 hours, very little scent remained.

I don't usually spray fragrance on my clothing, but decided to give it a try the next time I used BURBERRY Weekend.
Result:  I decided I like this fragrance better if I spray it on my clothes rather than on my skin. It's a bit softer on my clothing, but still smells mostly floral with a touch of freshness.

UPDATE: I sprayed it lightly on my wrist today, & had better results. No mild headache & no strong fragrance, but  a soft,  powdery, floral fragrance remained for about 6 or 7 hours.","Spray lightly...to me this has a fresh, floral scent which lasted about 6 hrs.

If i use it everyday(which i don't) i would replace it every 2 to 3 months to achieve maximum benefits.
This brush set is awesome. it will probably last you for a year or more (if you use other clarisonic brushes along side this one)

About the brush itself - This is my least favorite brush in terms of output. It is mild on your skin so it is great for everyday use but in terms of immediate results, this is my least favorite brush. I use it every other day but long term i think this brush has helped me with a beautiful skin. If you are a fan of exfoliation type brush (the deep pore cleansing brush) you will find this brush boring but trust me it works wonders for your skin if you use it everyday or every other day for a few weeks. i like to use mine every other day along with the deep pore cleansing brush and the radiance brush (twice a week) and my skin has shown a huge positive difference. It has helped minimize pores, gentle on sensitive skin types and gives you what i call a clarisonic glow!!

Cons: Will highlight bags, so be careful over uneven or puffy areas. Not an opaque concealer.

An eyelighter is intended to brighten the under eye area. It is generally worn over foundation and even concealer if necessary.

This product does a good job of highlighting. It is creamy, applies evenly, blends well, and dries fairly quickly. It contains a moderate amount of pigment and is more translucent than opaque. Once applied and blended into the rest of the makeup with a dry or damp sponge, it gives an attractive brightness or glow to the under eye area, the bridge of the nose, the cheekbones, or any other area it is applied.

It makes me sad to see adults with terrible acne scarring that could have been avoided. As far as I can determine eating things like greasy food or chocolate causing acne is a myth.

First I should remind you this device is not for scarring, wrinkles, dark spots, rosacea, cystic acne or anything else except inflammatory acne. Of course don't use on moles, cold sores etc. If you're on a prescription consult your dermatologist. If you have dark skin start using the ""blue' more slowly.  They think that maybe darker skin types are more sensitive to the infrared heat in the device, and maybe they should get used to the device more gradually. They don't say so but I would think this would be a reason to avoid using on tattoos.

You should have some kind of timing device (an hour-glass egg timer works well) to tell you when to move the device to another area. Wouldn't it be nice if they could put a time reminder on it like they do electric toothbrushes? But the most important thing you will need is patience and determination.  You have to hold the device on each area for three or four minutes twice a day.  You won't believe how long three minutes really is. If you're listening to music it's about the length of one song (unless it's ""stairway to heaven"" of course)

Be sure to completely charge the unit the first time before you use it.  Be sure your skin is completely clean and dry before you start. They say it will take from three to seven weeks for the ""Blue"" to work but I think there is a visible improvement in as little as a week.  After the acne clears you will need to continue weekly for prevention of outbreaks.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

I think the actual product has a bit more purple in it than is evident from the official product image here, but the color is quite pretty, and it's a lovely, rosy color on my cheeks (I'm the palest foundation shade and it's not too dark for me).

I am a fan of the baked blushes.  This is one of the first I used, but there is something about the baking that makes it not very powdery or crumbly, so there's not a lot of fallout and pretty much no wasted product.  So the package lasts a long time.  (Though I don't think I've ever finished a blush...)  I just take a little bit onto a brush and swipe it across each cheek, then blend with my fingers.  I have on primer, liquid foundation, concealer, and powder foundation under this, and it doesn't interfere with any of those, but rather blends pretty nicely.  It also looks good with some highlighter added on top of my cheekbones, when I am wearing this.

In the past I've been wary of it, feeling that it's all about packaging and marketing, while the product itself is very watery, with the end result being that you have to apply several coats just to see the polish, and thus use up the bottle in no time.

This sheer pink, however, is not too bad. Using just one coat, it leaves a touch of pink that has the glossy transparency of a French manicure. Perhaps because the liquid is thin (typical of Julep), it dries fairly quickly. Though the product is reputedly ""vegan"" friendly, the smell of the nail polish was still very strong and kept my cat away.

This gimmick with this one is that it has ingredients to help you strengthen your nails. Since regular nail polish already adds an additional layer of protection over your nails, I'm not seeing any difference as yet. So far its chief value is its appearance.

First of all, it made my hair feel crackly and not soft.  My hair is already thick and unruly so this was not a plus.  For people with fine hair, this may be great.

The container. Dispensing is easily controlled and does not continue to bubble out like some mousses I've used.

WHAT IS THIS LIKE?
This salt scrub is made with fine himalayan salt.  It comes in a red plastic jar and is sealed.  It has some oil in it, but mostly salt, so it is not over-oily.  The smell is delicious.  Although it has some artificial fragrance, it does not gag me or make me prefer a natural one instead.

HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?
When using this in the shower with dampened skin, I found that I only need a teaspoon for my arms and a little more than that for each leg.  The salt is very fine and it does scrub well.  It is not overly oily, but it does seal the skin nicely, creating a moisturizing effect.  The fragrance is very lovely.  It stays on long enough to make me feel special, but is not so strong that people recoil when they encounter me after a shower.

ANY BAD REACTIONS?
There have been no bad reactions to this at all.

MOISTURIZING?
The moisturizing lasts for me all day and into the next day although it is summer and I don't have as hard of a time as winter for dryness.

THE BOTTOM LINE
For a beautifully fragrant experience that feels royal and naturally but gently exfoliates the skin, this scrub is really lovely.  More natural in composition than some scrubs, it is a very rich experience.

That wasn't my experience, though.  For starters, the HEAVILY perfumed scent was very unappealing to me with my first use.  I don't insist on only unscented facial creams and usually expect at least some underlying scent in most beauty products that I buy.  However, this is by no means an ""underlying"" scent with the Immortelle Divine Cream.  Instead, the strong perfume hits you as soon as you remove the lid.  Fortunately, the heavy scent doesn't seem to last more than a few minutes after applying it to my face.  Or at least I didn't notice the strong smell after a few minutes.  My skin can sometimes react negatively to heavily fragranced skincare products, but I experienced no breakouts with the Immortelle Divine Cream.

As far as the anti-aging benefits, I haven't noticed any difference in three months of use.  In fairness, I always use high quality facial creams and serums, so it's unlikely to register the same improvement in a situation like that as opposed to someone who uses few, if any, high-end beauty products.  My skin texture neither improved nor worsened, although I did notice that my skin wasn't quite as dewy or glowing with this cream as it is with some other night creams.

What I DO like about it?  It seems to last a bit longer than similarly sized jars of other creams.  I think this is because a smaller amount seems to go further when smoothing onto your face.  It has a bit of an oily texture going on, so my face would be a greasy mess if I used the amount I'd normally use.  The result is that a little 1.7 oz jar is lasting longer than usual.  This would be great if it happened to be a night cream that I loved.

This L'Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream works best used only as a night cream.  For several hours, my skin is left with a greasiness from it that doesn't work with any daytime makeup application.  It's fine for daytime when I'm going without makeup, but most days I apply at least a light dusting of bareMinerals powder.  The powder just thickly gums up on my skin when I tried to apply it over this cream, even if I wait for a half hour or so.  And liquid foundation just sort of disappears and doesn't adhere to my skin.

I'm always concerned about high-end beauty products possibly being counterfeit and I specifically avoid buying them if they're far below the normal purchase price or have slight differences in packaging.  My little jar arrived in original box with all of the safety seals, including the pretty embossed gold foil inner seal.  The expiration date on mine wasn't great -- due to expire 2-3 months after my date of receipt.  I'd actually intended to send it back for a refund after I noticed that, but time got away from me and by the time I went to do it, it was after Amazon's 30-day return policy.

Bottom line, this cream does as well as any of my other favorite night creams in the $50-80 range.  If you don't mind the strong perfume scent or paying extra for a cream that doesn't seem to do anything special, you might be happy with it.",VERY strongly perfumed and doesn't seem to work any better than less expensive night creams,1479513600,15.0,

I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.

I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.

Began with my Shellac base coat then applied two coats of this: first time allowed a 2 minute curing time, then applied the next coat with a 3 minute curing time, followed up by Shellac top coat. The color was remarkably similar to the shade you see in the bottle, a vibrant and colorful lilac shade. The color was even, and the shade deep with no sheer areas! Color stayed in place for almost 2 weeks and was a perfect hue for Spring.

I was pleasantly surprised, and for those that like to match their toes with a regular polish (removing Shellac from toes is never the easiest process) I found a very similar color from Revlon:  Number 220 Enchanting from  their regular polish line!

I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!

This medium-coverage concealer is smooth, easy to apply and gives almost complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish. I tested ""Cocoa/Deep"" on the back of my hand (see image attached - the lightest color below my middle finger on the back of the hand). It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin.

As with a couple of my other DermaBlend products, I have to sort of shake my head at the name they've chosen for the color. For example, the Saffron foundation I have from them isn't any sort of Saffron at all. I do think that this color is not any sort of ""Cocoa"", and I would have expected ""Deep"" to be darker, and less orange. That said, if it were covering a blue-tinted place (like at the temple, with blood veins peeking through) it would probably be perfect.

This set of four provides a good introduction to the different kinds and is especially useful if you don't yet know which brush you prefer.  The only brush I hadn't tried before receiving this assortment was the cashmere; its bristles are about twice as long as the regular and are incredibly soft.  I almost hated putting soap on the cashmere head to use for the first time.  This set also includes a Sensitive Skin, Radiance, and Deep Pore Cleansing heads.  My favorite and go-to brush is the Radiance, but Clarisonic makes it so easy to change from one to another that I use the Deep Pore one once a week.  Even though I have sensitive skin, I feel that that head is unnecessary, although maybe I would if I were younger.  Of course, the cashmere one is also unnecessary, but it feels so luxurious that it's worth trying at least through one brush head.

This would make a great gift set, particularly as a companion to one of Clarisonics devices.  Yes, the brush heads are expensive -- the whole system is -- but it makes sense to buy them in a pack like this that offers a little savings rather than buying them individually.

I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.

At first I didn't like it very much and had not bought bar soap for many years using only liquid soap for face, hands and body. I have tried this and a few others that are similar in price (or even more expensive) and it's growing on me now. The reviews of this soap are basically good and I can see now why they are. My skin has not been dry after using this and I did test it by not using any lotion on my body which I normally do every night after a shower. I also used it to hand wash some underwear and it was quite good. The lavender fragrance is not too strong for those who want to have the smell linger afterwards. As I said in my first review this bar is rather large and a bit awkward at first. I found it slipping out of my hands but am using a washcloth now to prevent this from happening. I did want to revise my first negative review for people like myself who do read them before buying something they're not familiar with online! The original version was: This is the first soap bar that I have purchased in many years - I use bath and shower gel and liquid face soap. I thought I would try something different and since this had many good reviews and I like the smell of lavender I bought it. I recently noticed that my skin was looking 'thin' and I attributed this to the many showers using a washcloth on my skin with the liquid soap. My skin is normally dry (bar soap has always been drying to me and I do apply moisturizer after every shower) and this one didn't feel dry right after using it which I did like. The bar is large and should last a long time but it does get slippery when it gets wet and slides off the built in soap bar in the shower and it's somewhat awkward to hold on to. The lavender smell is not so strong and it really doesn't have any scent unless you put your nose on top of the bar before it gets wet. As for the price of this soap I think it's a little too high and possibly because of the name L'Occitane and the fact that it's made in France the way it is described.  I'm not sorry I bought this and will use it eventually, perhaps for some hand washing of delicates. I will say this soap lathers very well!",Not for me at first but like it now!,1492819200,,

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave.

My sense is that it is at its best doing what I term as ""maintenance shaves"". That is, one or two passes in order to get to an acceptable level of closeness. On very thorough shaves, it can become a bit aggressive. Every time I've done a third facial pass, I have found that I regretted it afterward. Not because I have actually cut myself, but because I have felt that I've put more wear and tear on my face than was warranted.

My experience indicates that a moderate blade works best here, one that splits the difference between smoothness and sharpness. My go-to for the 39C is the Personna Lab Blue. The Wilkinson Sword worked great for the first pass, but was really prone to getting a bit too aggressive on subsequent passes. Of course, your results may vary.

What this razor excels at is the first pass. None of my other DE razors take as much hair off, as easily, as the 39C. If your preference is to simply do a quick shave every day, and you're not looking for a baby smooth result. This is your machine. I wouldn't recommend it as a first DE razor, but that' simply because a slant head is always going to take a more gentle hand, and it could really cut you up if you couldn't find the angle.

 the brands that have been recommended to me either aren't very good at all
 (Clinique) or contain aloe (Neutrogena). Some of the products I've wanted to
 try (like L'Oreal) had scary reviews. I had hoped that this product from Vichy
 would be different.

 The Amazon product page gives the description of the product as a ""highly
 effective, yet gentle eye make-up remover to hydrates [sic], soothe and help
 reduce the appearance of fatigue."" The product is supposed to effectively
 remove eye makeup while soothing the under eye area.

 I will say that the product is rather soothing. It doesn't irritate the
 sensitive skin around my eyes, nor has it caused any irritation or dryness or
 anything like that. It also doesn't sting if it gets into my eyes during use.
 However, it doesn't do much toward removing my eye makeup, either. No matter
 how careful I am, no matter how much I put on the cotton pad nor how much time I
 take swabbing the eye area, I still have product come off onto my towel when I
 dry my face. I cleanse my face again before bed every night, and yet I still
 wake up with black smudges under my eyes every morning.

 I confess, I do wear a lot of eye makeup - every day, I wear shadow, liner, and
 mascara. Before I ever swab with eye makeup remove, I use cold cream and a warm
 washcloth to remove most of the makeup. It doesn't get it all obviously (I wear
 contacts and you don't want to risk getting cold cream in your eye, and you also
 don't want to scrub too much in that area) but it gets a lot. The fact that
 this product can't remove what's left is a big disappointment.

The product itself is terrific.  It's got a great antioxidant (vitamin C) which has been proven to build cell regeneration in aging skin, combined with ingredients that block both UVA and UVB rays (the rays that will sunburn you AND the rays that will age you.)  And it goes on with a smooth, matte finish that I've never seen in drugstore brands, or any brand that costs less than $25.  It's probably at least in the top 3 sunscreens I've ever used.

Cons:
That cost.  I got it for free because I'm a Vine Voice -- I can't imagine shelling out $72 for such a small quantity.  On a related (downside) note, the packaging is this tiny pump that only pumps out a little at a time.  To get the necessary coverage on my face -- because sunscreen is not the thing you want to skimp on - I need to pump this sucker a good 8-9 times.  That tries my patience, and, if you're someone who isn't familiar with the science behind sunscreen and the necessity of making sure you really cover your face, is going to lead to insufficient coverage. And what's the point of blocking UVA/UVB rays if you don't actually put enough on?  So, at the very least, I think they need to change the packaging to encourage women to get the sun care they actually need.

I'd give the product itself 5 stars easy, but that bad packaging requires a few star knock-offs.  So, 3 stars.",Excellent sunscreen in crappy packaging.,1486512000,,

If you are going to use them 'as directed' you will be making quite a commitment because you are expected to apply the Nourisher and the Smoother twice daily and the Lifter once a day. I have to admit that Ms. Cthulhu is only using them before the microcurrent treatment and she's only doing it twice a week because she's in 'maintenance mode' at this time. And she's very happy with the results. Her skin is above-average sensitive but, so far, she is tolerating these quite well.

I am not a specialist and there are lots of ingredients in each of the three samples but the makers claim that the Nourisher contains apple, grape and alpine rose stem cell extracts, the Smoother has a long list of multi-syllable and difficult to pronounce ingredients and the Lifter features Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.

To conclude, these are good skin treatments. They seem to enhance the effects of the microcurrent NuFace devices, don't know if they should be tried without it. Also, 'for best results', the makers recommend that you use them together.

Considering the fact that so many cosmetics are made with harmful chemicals, it's good to know that Juice Beauty provides a viable alternative. While their products may not fit my skin type completely, I'm glad that their high quality ingredients ensures that they won't do too much harm, either.

I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but unfortunately it feels just too thick and pasty for my taste. It comes in a nice frosted glass jar and has a consistency not unlike sour cream. Because it feels so thick, I used it sparingly on my face and neck. Fortunately, my skin absorbed it quickly and it doesn't leave too much of a residue. The fragrance is so mild as to be almost not there, which I don't mind (I shy away from anything too strong-smelling).

It's OK but I have many different types of moisturizer and nothing about this one stood out.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick.

But the foundation went on really quickly, almost as quickly as my big puffy brush I usually use with loose powder.  I buy high-quality brushes as a rule, but I love this brush even more than my normal one and will be using it from now on.

I am surprised that this foundation is described as a cream, as it looks and applies like a powder.  I tried it on bare skin, on half my face.  My teenaged daughter immediately pointed to that side of my face and said, ""That side looks better.  And younger.""  I was surprised at the younger comment.  Then she asked if that was the side that has the makeup on.  It is that light, that you can hardly tell that you are wearing it other than that you look better.  I put some on her and she loved it too.  She has extremely sensitive skin and so far has had no issues.  I agreed to let her wear it--on special occasions.  Hey, age has its privileges, like indulging in top-of-the-line makeup.

Like portable loose powder makeups, you open the compact to reveal a thin second cover with holes in it.  However, you don't twist it, put the lid back on, shake it and remove the lid to get to the powder, as with other compacts I have owned.  You merely twist it, and similar to a clicking lip gloss applicator, a small amount of powder is deposited on top.  Kinda cool.  One side is light and the other is dark.  The first time I applied it I swirled it all together and was surprised when it turned out a little too light, even for my fair skin.  It is very easy to custom blend right there in the container, getting the proper amount of light and dark to customize to your skin tone.  Whatever is left over (light or dark) is perfect for highlighting or contouring.  This sounds complicated but it really is not and takes only a fraction of a second of thought and no talent.

I was surprised at just how much I like this powder and will continue to buy it.  Hopefully by the time I run out, Amazon will sell the powder separately from the brush",Excellent Foundation,1429833600,,

Nye,"I originally tried Baxter of California After Shave Balm as part of a starter kit that contained a Baxter of California shaving brush, shaving cream, and this balm.  The balm has a pleasant citrus scent to it, but it fades quickly and will not interfere with the scent of any other aftershave or cologne you might want to use afterward.  I really like how my face feels after using it.  I usually rub some alum on my face after shaving and rinse it off right before I apply the balm.  Just a small dab of the balm is needed, and I find one tube has lasted several months with daily usage with about 1/3 of the tube still remaining.  My face always feels really good afterwards, and I have experienced less shaving irritation with the balm.  After using it for a few weeks I have found my complexion has improved, too.

I have used the Vincent Longo Blonde Micro Pencil for several weeks now and I have to say that it does not wear well.  The pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.

The color is nice- very close to MAC Lingering or Tarte Taupe brow pencils in color.

The pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  The sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  I don't like that feature.

What I have found with this pencil is that despite it looking very close in color to the other two which I have previously mentioned, it does not wear as well.  I have done one brow with this pencil and a different one on the other.  At the end of the day, the other brand is still good, but the Vincent Longo pencil is smeary, spotty, and seems to have settled into my pores a bit too.

I do not have oily skin.

For the price, I don't think that this brow pencil works for me anyway.  Nice color, but very disappointing wear time.  I don't want to have to try that hard with any brow products.

It has a comfortable balance in the hand, the lever has a perfectly tuned resistance, and there's nothing your hair can catch on during use. This makes curling your hair a very slick and sleek operation. It's simply a pleasure to use.

According the manual, there are five additional barrels available to interchange with the convertible base . They are: a 1.25-75"" tapered barrel, a 1"" straight barrel, a 1.5"" straight barrel, a 1"" straight barrel with clip, and a 1.25"" straight barrel with clip. That's quite a long list, and helps justify the lofty price point, especially if you like variety in your styling habits. I, however, don't curl my hair on a daily basis and that's why I removed one star from the review. I think there are less expensive and functional options available for folks who don't require an iron day after day.

This iron heats up impeccably fast. It reached its hottest setting in under 30 seconds! I have very thick hair, so I had to use very small portions of hair on each go. The result, however, were very soft, shiny and sleek curls like nothing I've ever previously experienced.

It goes on easily and smoothly.  Although it comes out looking 'white,' (it's the sunscreen), it didn't seem to have color on my face.
It has SPF 15 sunscreen.  Why doesn't every foundation and primer have sunscreen?  This is perfect for wear to and from the office.
I am 54 and have oily skin.  Even on a humid Iowa day, at the end of the day, after using this product, I still had a relatively matte finish rather than a big oil slick, and my foundation was still in place, i.e. it hadn't slid off the way it usually does.

Things that gave me pause about this product --

It took me a while to figure out how to get it open.  I know, how hard can it be, right?  The chrome lid is a pull-off, not a twist off.  THEN, the semi-conical ""spout"" does twist 180 degrees from ""off"" to ""on""  So, two steps, which is kinda weird.

The reason I can't love this product --

I have oily, blemish-prone skin.  I'd gone 4 weeks without a breakout but by the end of the first day with this primer, I had three new blemishes.  To be totally fair, I have NEVER found ANY primer that doesn't make me breakout.  It's not an irritation at all, just blemishes.  So if you don't have blemish-prone skin and have used other primers successfully, I would recommend this one, because I really did like the feel, the performance and the sunscreen.

I was surprised how much I like this. You really do only need a small amount - just a pea-sized drop- and just use that to clean your entire face and neck. It's great because unlike many cleansing creams and soaps, you don't have to put it on with a pad or sponge; just use your fingers and add water.

So it really does work well as a cleanser and also it is a makeup remover. It's also advertised to work as a toner as well. In fact, they recommend leaving it on your face for 5 minutes before you wash it off.

The first time I did that, the next morning I found that bits of the skin on my face sloughed off - but not in a severe way like it did when I tried using a retinol cream. Instead this sloughing was barely noticible (more I could feel it) and I just rinsed my face and it felt so much cleaner and softer. Loved it.

I have tried and used many facial cleaners and aging creams from cheaply priced to very expensive, and have to say this is my favorite cleanser. It is on the expensive side, but you really don't need to use very much - just that pea-sized drop.

I agree with another reviewer who referred to it as clean-smelling, but this is not the kind of scent you might find on bath soap or deodorant.  It is much more refined than that.

I too have learned to love this stuff, as I am dumbfounded at how expensive those makeup brushes can be and have no intention of buying her replacements.

PARENT TIP: We use her love of makeup as a motivational tool.  When she does a chore, we ask her, ""Is that MAC and UrbanDecay quality, or is that Walgreens quality?""  If she does well she gets good stuff... If she cuts corners, so do we.  It works great for us.

Elemis Biotec skin cream only requires one application, in the morning or before bedtime, to keep my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day or all night. There is no skin cream that is going to get rid of every wrinkle or crease. The best skin creams can only keep the skin plumped and hydrated enough that wrinkles are smoothed and seem to disappear or at least be less noticeable. But I believe that by keeping the skin moist we can at least delay the appearance of some of the new wrinkles.

One of the biggest reasons I like this cream is that it makes my skin feel good. When my face feels dry, right after a shower, or outdoors on a cold or windy day, it makes me feel out of sorts and uncomfortable. This is advertised as a night cream, but I use it in the morning as well. Why not? It absorbs easily and seems to work fine under make-up. I don't wear foundations anymore, which seem too heavy on aging skin, but a light cream to even out the tone, if needed, and a cream blush seem to work well.

Always looking for new skin care items, I read the boxes and saw all the benefits of the Dead Sea minerals and bought several of them. I have been hooked since. I think I have or have had, every one of their products. This night serum was new to me. It goes on smoothly, has a very light fragrance and my skin feels amazing when I wake up in the morning. Everyone over the age of 40 has to try Ahava products. My skin (at age 61) looks better and feels better than it did when I was in my mid-30's.

During the past year, my skin has become dry, irritated and red.  To my chagrin, I had to stop using an electric shaver; this helped but I still had some patches of dry skin in areas where I didn't shave, primarily around my left eyebrow.  In order to relieve the situation, I had to shave every other day and only wash my face in the morning and never at night.  Every morning, I used an exfoliator that was designed to be gentle (NIVEA Men Sensitive Face Wash).  Still, I had to use a lot of Cetaphil in order to relieve my dry skin.

  When the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Mario Badescu Seaweed Cleansing Soap, I jumped at the opportunity to try it.  It has noticeably improved the feel and texture of my skin.  I have returned to shaving every day and to washing my face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night before going to bed.  In fact, I feel confident that I could wash it more often as needed.  I squeeze a tiny smear of the greenish, speckled cream onto the palm of my left hand and use my right fingers to smear it onto my face.  I gently rub it into my skin.  The seaweed cleansing soap has a pleasant smell that is barely noticeable.  It is not strong and abrasive like liquid aftershave.

  The soap is easily washed off.  It does not sting my flesh like some exfoliators have done.  My skin is left feeling moist, not dry and irritated.  According to the packaging, this soap is designed for ALL skin types.  The plastic bottles appearance is neither feminine nor masculine.  It is what I call gender friendly.  However, there wasn't any safety seal beneath the old-fashioned screw on cap.  It is difficult to rub a small amount into the palm of my hand.  It would have been better if the cap had a spout that lies flat with the top of the bottle.  You lift up the spout and squeeze out a small dollop of the cream.

  Overall, I really like the seaweed cleansing soap from Mario Badescu Skincare.  It thoroughly cleans my skin, giving it a healthy glow, without dehydrating it.  I relish the creamy texture, color and scent of the cleanser.  It easily washes off my face.  The bottle is small enough to carry in a backpack, purse, shoulder bag, tote bag, etc.  Therefore, it is conducive for traveling.  After using the product for nearly a week, I haven't experienced any adverse side effects.  I highly recommend this seaweed cleansing soap.  It would make a thoughtful present for someone with a troubled complexion.","Excellent Exfoliator from Mario Badescu; It Leaves My Skin Feeling Refreshed and Clean, Not Dry and Irritated!",1473292800,2.0,

I tested a small dab on myself and a full spray on my wife.  The scent was strong up to the first four hours, and gently declines until it is just a hint after 12 hours.  The EDP concentration rating is the strongest available, and one spray should last all day.

Advice from a former perfume seller- if you buy Carven for below full price from other sellers, beware that the bottles are often sourced from other countries and there is no guarantee of authenticity.

The mitt seemed small for my large hands, but I managed to get my whole hand in the mitt; it stretched a bit & wasn't uncomfortable. Because it fit tightly, it didn't move around & made application easier for me.

One side of the mitt has a foam backing - apply the tanner to this side.  The other side is a piece of fabric.

It's recommended to wash it before first use to remove any bits of lint that might come off & hinder the tan, and, of course, wash it after each use.

I love that this very creamy lotion is infused with macadamia oil.  It also has honey and lemon infused in it, too.

I think that anyone who has dry hands will appreciate this product.  It left my hands smoother and less dry.  The scent was subtle, too.  The tube is rather pretty, too.  I don't mind allowing it to sit on my kitchen windowsill.

For her, it penetrates her skin rather quickly and she says that it smoothes it almost as soon as it's absorbed (reducing those visible signs of aging).

She rather likes the dropper, and I can think of no better way to apply any kind of oil (the beard oil people have been doing this for a while).

My wife has referred to the scent as ""light,"" and after taking a few whiffs, I'm inclined to agree. It's not overpowering and doesn't break her out (and she has very sensitive skin).

19006,5,False,"05 29, 2015",ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,B006HMAT9C,,Terry R. Nye,"For many years I have been in search of a quality, compact grooming kit.  Over the years I have had kits given to me as gifts, and have purchased kits myself, but all have been the typical Chinese junk one finds at the local discount stores.  For a long time I have had to settle for nice nail clippers made in Japan, which I really like, but I have still lacked the nice matched set I've wanted.  So when I received the opportunity to review the Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set I got very excited.  The set arrived in today's mail and was perfect timing as my nails have very much been in need of a trim, and I have been waiting for the set to arrive.

First off, this is not just over-priced junk.  This is a very precision-engineered grooming set manufactured by the same company known for its premium chef knives.  This grooming set falls in that same category of quality craftsmanship where you get what you pay for.  So before fainting at the price keep in mind you are paying for very high quality.

The set arrives in a nice box for gifting, and the grooming tools are neatly arranged in a stylish, thick leather case with a zipper closure.  There are only 5 tools in the set, but the case is overly large and has extra slots in it that lead me to believe it was designed to hold additional tools (a comb and/or razor, perhaps?).  Each tool has its own slot with the longer file and cuticle pusher needing to be kept at the edges of the case or it won't close.  The case is a bit bulky for this grooming set, but the leather is very nice and no doubt contributes to some of the high cost of this set.

The nail clippers are very unique and frustrated me at first.  Unlike other clippers, these are designed to fold completely flat for storage and arrive that way.  To open them you must gently pull back on the top half of the clipper (there is a small ribbed area on it to give you a surface to pull it backward with) which allows the two pieces to separate a little bit.  This is where I got initially frustrated as the tool will not clip or work properly without taking the additional step of lifting the back end of the upper clipper upward and then pushing it forward to lock it into a clipping position.  I don't know if the one I received had a stuck spring or if I just didn't use it correctly at first, but once I figured it out I had no problems using the clipper.  The manufacturer really should provide a little instruction sheet with this set as I have no doubt many have been frustrated thinking the clipper was useless from not knowing how to open it correctly.  The clippers are so lightweight and frail-feeling that I was afraid they might break easily, but I quickly found that very little force is needed for them to precisely cut my nails.  And when I say cut, I mean cut.  These have very precise and sharp edges that cut the nail off with absolutely no jagged edges or tearing like ordinary clippers.  Even the fine Japanese nail clippers I own do not cut this easily and precisely.  After clipping my nails I found little need for usage of the nail file, although the file in this kit is equally nice and works great.

The scissors in this kit are also remarkable in their precision and sharpness.  The rounded tip makes them very safe for trimming eyebrows, nose hairs, and hair that always seems to grow out of men's ears as we get older.  There is nothing particularly special about the cuticle pusher/nail cleaner or tweezers.  They have the same look and feel as the other tools in the set, but for my purposes won't see that much use.  In a perfect world, for the cost involved, it seems like a small stainless steel comb should have been included in this set.

Overall, this is a very fine grooming set.  I would say this is what I have had in mind in my years of searching for a quality groomng set.  The cost of this set will not be appealing or likely appropriate for many men, but for the man who appreciates quality and wants a nice grooming set to stay well-groomed this Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set is definitely worth its cost.",for the man who has everything and willing to pay for high quality,1432857600,6.0,

I tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn't work. The color is really pretty to naked eye.

I am picky about my products because I believe shaving is an art. I did not expect to be overly impressed with L'Occitane CADE Shaving Cream but I was. If you are just a squirt from the can kind of guy this may not be for you. There is no doubt that you can rub in in your hands and apply it to your face and get a decent shave, but this cream works best for me when applied directly to my shaving brush after it has been moistened with hot water (before applying the Cream to the moistened brush shake the brush once to eliminate excess water saturation). The amount of Cream squeezed from the tube to the shaving brush should be no more than the length of toothpaste you would squeeze onto your toothbrush. There is no need to spread this Cream on your shaving brush. Instead, working the brush starting on either side of the face using a circular wrist action will begin to work up this cream into a lather as you work he brush on your face. Once you have covered your face by circular motions, use a back and forth motion with your brush to make a consistent, smooth creamy layer on your face. I won't go into shaving technique but I found that this Shaving Cream significantly reduced the nicks I got in the shaving process. I still get nicks but they are few and far between and I don't get nicked every time I shave.

CONDITIONER - this conditioner was also nice.  In the shower it left my hair easily combed out with a shower comb.  This was especially appreciated because my hair is in bad shape at the moment.  After I towel dried my hair though, and left it wrapped in a towel, my hair suddenly had knots.

HEALING OIL - I love the oil.  As I said my hair suddenly had tangles.  Instead of reaching for my usual fix of Miracle 10, I decided to try the oil.  It really got rid of the tangles.  I didn't use a lot, only rubbed the troubled hair with the oil.  It was easy to comb out after that.

The colors are white with copper-ish colored trim.  I expect the copper color to definitely wear off with frequent use, but for starts it's the loveliest curling iron I've ever seen.  And I guess it should be for $185.00.  I have several curling irons and brushes stuffed under my bathroom sink right now and none of them compare to this one.  The clip that holds hair against the heated barrel is strong and the clip must be opened to release hair once it's been curled.  You will not be able to easily pull it out without losing some hair so be sure to open it again.

The various 5 heat settings are really nice to have and are very easy to set.  I don't like it very hot but my daughter has very tough hair and needs to use the highest heat setting.  The T3 Micro Twirl Convertible Curling Iron comes (I believe because it's not quite super clear) with a straight 1.25 barrel but you can purchase different sizes of barrels.

It heats up fast and they include a black pad to rest the hot barrel on when you lay it down on your bathroom countertop.  I think that was a very nice extra since it could possibly damage it if it was really hot.  The tip of the barrel does not heat up so you can hold it with your bare fingers if you need too.  Still be careful though, because you have less than an inch of ""cool tip"" to hold onto.  The cord is nice an long and should give you plenty of room to work especially if you only have one electrical outlet and have to share the counter space with someone.  And the cord swivels from the end so getting your cord all curled up shouldn't be a problem.  It also has a 1-hour automatic shut off (which I admit, I haven't tested yet).

It's got a nice weight too.  It might get your arm tired for a while until you get used to it.  The instructions are well written with good diagrams so even if you don't read English you can still understand it, but then I guess you won't understand this review lol.

We cook a lot of food and use a lot of smelly onions, garlic, and fish.  There are times when the onion smell is so strong, it lasts for days despite hours of dishwashing, showers, and hand scrubbing with everything you can imagine that is designed for cleaning hands.

The shape of the bar is pointed oval with two recessed areas on each side.  The surface is matte which allows for you to hold the bar and not drop it constantly and the water will run over it nicely too.  I also feel that the surface allows for more agitation of the skin surface (NOT abrasion) so that the odor source is more effectively removed as compared to smooth surface.

WHAT IS THIS ""SOAP"" GOOD FOR?
I had heard of the stainless steel ""soaps"" being great for a whole host of things from removing kitchen smells from hands (onions, garlic, fish) to other organic smells.  Here is a brief list of what I have been told this would be good for:

-kitchen odors (onions, garlic, fish)
-urine odors (cleaning diapers and pet trays)
-body odor (under arm odor)
-smelly feet odor (organic in origin, not from synthetic shoe smell)
-unmentionable odors (I will leave that to your deduction skills)

That sounds like a tall order to fill.  I have tested for a variety of these odors so far and here is what I have found:

KITCHEN ODORS
We have tried this with garlic, onions, and fish.  When using soap first on smells that are new on the skin and then using the stainless steel bar on the hands for 40-45 seconds under running water, 90-100% of odors are removed from the hands.  When the odors are older and have been on the skin for a while (such as cutting onions for a giant pot of French Onion Soup, or tons of garlic for garlic laden dishes), with or without soap, about 80% or more of the odors are removed.  That is still quite significant.

I have never had a big problem with fish smells on my hands.

In the autumn when we get local onions, that will be another time to test because they are the most powerful in terms of removing from skin that I have encountered EVER. No other onions the rest of the year compare to the local onions that time of year. I will update if there is more to report there. If this removes most of THAT odor, I will be thrilled.

URINE ODORS
We have male rabbits and a cat.  This can make for a huge odor problem with things you have to wash or encounter in cleaning up.  I have found that using this bar as recommended after soap, almost all of the odor is gone consistently.  I would imagine this would also be applicable to mothers who have to contend with diapers and other baby messes involving organic origins.

BODY ODOR
When using this in the shower, you can apply it to the under arms using the same principle (a bit tricky to keep water flowing on the area constantly compared to hands) I do find that it really does cut down on body odor more than not using it.  This would be a great idea to keep one in the shower for any family members who have a bit harder time with strong body odor.

SMELLY FEET
I have not had the opportunity to use it yet as no one has had the problem recently.  I will update when I do.

UNMENTIONABLE ODOR
Used once in a difficult situation during an illness that affected odor, it did help a lot.  This would be another reason to keep one in the shower for someone who has a difficulty in this area.  It is not chemical or harmful to the body and does help remedy the situation greatly.

THE BOTTOM LINE
This stainless steel bar is not only great for reducing or eliminating kitchen odors, but also for pet urine, diaper smell, body odors of various kinds, and perhaps even more that I have not discovered as of yet.  The bar is designed to be a bit rougher in texture so that it will help more effectively get the odors off of the skin and keep it from slipping out of the hands when wet.  It is easy to hold and well designed.",Great To Have Around For A Multitude of Uses In Addition To Kitchen,1418774400,,

Strivectin is a well-known name in skin products, since its beginnings as a company that just produced a skin cream to reduce stretch marks.  Now they have branched out into any number of skincare products.

According to its description, this Advanced Retinol Eye Cream has been proven to (1) deliver benefits of retinol without skin irritation, (2) minimize fine lines and crow's feet, (3) firm and fortify the eye area, (4) nourish and hydrate, and (5) smooth and refine texture.  To make this sound even better, it has a patented NIA-114 technology to do all this.  (Yeah, I don't know what that is either.)

However, a reading of the list of ingredients, of which there are more than 50, does not inspire a lot of confidence that this is truly revolutionary.  Other than the retinol, it looks like the usual ingredients for skin creams, some of them perfectly innocuous, some of them slightly iffy.

But how does it work?  Does this grandmother have minimized fine lines, smoother and more refined skin texture, less visible signs of aging around the eyes?  Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't notice that this works any better than many less expensive eye products I've used in the past.  And, even though I only use a very small amount under each eye (maybe a dab the size of a sesame seed), it takes quite a while to be absorbed.  It feels somewhat greasy and looks somewhat shiny, and, if I put on mascara, there is sometimes smearing when the eyelashes touch the moisturized skin under my eyes.

After I have used up this sample, I won't be purchasing it again.  Considering its high price, I don't consider it effective enough.  What I really need is to get enough sleep.  That's what makes these old eyes of mine look better.

 Water/Aqua/Eau, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Lauramide MIPA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Propylene Glycol, Glycol Distearate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Ulva Lactuca Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates Copolymer, Ammonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Ammonium Sulfate, Benzophenone-4, C11-15 Pareth-7, Citric Acid, DimethylPABAmidopropyl Laurdimonium Tosylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Laureth-9, Lauryl Glucoside, Laureth-1, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Octyldodecanol, Phytantriol, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Glycolate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Trideceth-12, Triethanolamine, Maltodextrin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum/Fragrance, Citronellol, Geraniol, Linalool, Red 33 (CI 17200), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 10 (CI 47005)

You will note A LOT of non-natural ingredients for a premium-priced shampoo.  The product actually has a lighter than expected fragrance; but the fragrance is pleasant.  Expected cleansing and manageability was achieved.  I would compare this product to readily available ""supermarket brands"" which leads to my opinion that the product is overpriced.  Additionally, the packaging in exceptionally simple.  I am surprised at how basic this product is packaged in comparison to some of the company's other products, such as H2O Plus Sea Marine which is actually priced lower than the H2O Plus Eucalyptus & Aloe.

And, there is no magic tube of anything that will erase all the damage caused by sun and as the years progressed,  prescription medications, etc. I just want to look as healthy as I can without causing more damage and so many exfoliators on the market are just too strong, especially for someone fair-skinned like me with mild rosacea.

After reading other reviews on Crepe Erase I thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did!  I live in a dry climate and I have very dry skin and sometimes I just don't take that good care of it so I have flaky skin as well, ugh.

I actually could SEE the difference on my arms and legs after using the Crepe Erase just one time.  Anything was an improvement, but this improvement was really noticeable and my skin felt so soft.  I mean, I was really happy with how I looked!  My skin was healthier to look at and it did not look as crepey as it did before.

Use it once or twice a day, underneath heavier skin creams and sun screens to provide anti-aging benefits that are missing or reduced in the other products.

This particular serum contains Rhamnose, a naturally occurring sugar from the Buckthorn plant and Hyaluronic Acid. Hyaluronic Acid is a major component of healthy skin and when used topically, binds moisture to the skin and strengthens the skins protective barrier. Vichy (which is owned by LOral) claims that Rhamnose has anti-inflammatory and skin soothing properties. This is based on a small sample clinical trial that was funded by Vichy. Whether Vichys claim on the efficacy of Rhamnose is accurate or not is anyones guess. Lets say that it may be effective. It will take about a month to see if there are any real effects.

This serum is a light milky looking liquid that has a floral fragrance. It spreads easily over the face and neck and is absorbed quickly. I do not find the fragrance objectionable. If you are sensitive to fragrance, you may dislike this one.

It is dispensed from an eye dropper attached to the products cap. Prior to unscrewing the cap, press down once on the button at the top of the cap. This fills up the eyedropper with the appropriate amount of serum. Unscrew the cap and holding the dropper over an open hand press the button and the serum is released. I find that a single dose is plenty to spread over my face and neck.

I use this serum in the morning prior to applying moisturizer. So far, I have found it pleasant and easy to tolerate. My skin is soft and smooth and because of this, signs of ageing are diminished.

Most have at least a tiny bit of shimmer which I hate.  They don't look natural or beautiful on light skin.  A lot of makeup artists say that a shimmery bronzer is great on people with deep skin tones.  My skin tone is light-medium.  The Balm seemed like a good one to try based on some YouTube reviews I watched.  I am absolutely pleased with it.  It's 100% matte, has a soft and creamy natural texture.  It is a powder but it really melts into my liquid and cream foundations beautifully.  It has good pigmentation, and a little bit of product goes a long way.  This makes it easier to work with since you don't have to keep layering it.  I find that products that aren't pigmented enough require a lot of layering which makes the product look caked on.  It is VERY easy to blend.  I love the shade most of all. It isn't too warm or cool.  It isn't ashy.  It's the perfect color for warming up your face.

This primer by Japonesque is mostly an illuminating base that can be worn under foundation or can also stand on it's own as a product that brings out a healthy glow. That said, it's really only going to give a healthy glow for those with fair skin. Those with darker skin I think may find that this is really best only used under other makeup, as a primer. It has a lightening effect, which I really like since I'm fair skinned, but others won't.

It smooths on nicely, and the bottle is a decently large size considering that a little goes a long way with this product. It has a shimmery look which can help make dry skin like mine look fresh and dewy. On the other hand, I'm not sure this is my favorite primer. While it's a nice fresh, illuminating base, it doesn't have that silicone feel my other primers have had. I've also noticed this product doesn't make makeup stay put the way my other primers have. So if you're looking for a good fresh base--whether it is to stand alone or to go under makeup--this is good, just don't expect this to be one of those primers that makes your makeup invincible throughout the day.

The Eau De Toilette is not as strong as a perfume, and takes a bit more but is potent and lasting. 1-2 sprays provides a great scent profile for most people. An ounce will last a nice long time in normal use.  The scent itself lasts about 5 hours, but that can vary by person.

This is a woody, green, herbal fragrance that is manly and fresh without being overtly sexy. In the initial spray, basil leads but quickly fades back to being an almost undetectable middle tone that says ""herbal"" really more than ""Basil"". After the dry down, which does not take long, the mandarin is an invigorating top note, while lavender lies just underneath. The base notes of sandalwood with just a tad of vetiver give it a woodsy, earthy fragrance and deep masculinity. Its probably got other notes, these are just the ones that I can distinctly detect. Also, note that in some people, after the dry down, the notes can vary in their lead, so it might seem more floral and sweet on some, if the lavender leads the fragrance on them.

The last thing I want is to look like an oompha-loompha, lol!  I bought it in San Francisco and at the time I swatched it, it didn't appear orange at all.

However, an hour later, I was struck by the color shift and I saw that I had orangey brown areas all over my face.  If you want a decent bronzer, either keep looking or try Hoola by Benefit.

When it comes to perfumes and fragrances my wife is hard to please.  I have purchased everything from Chanel No. 5 to Calvin Klein's CK One and everything in-between for her.  Usually she is nonplussed and will just say something like it is ""OK"", etc.  With this scent though my wife absolutely loves it.  It was kind of shocking.  She told me she wants to order more when it is gone.  She likes that it is a light fragrance, not overpowering, and that is fresh, crisp, and clean.  I personally enjoy the unique fragrance and I know immediately when she is wearing it.  I can't easily express the scent.  It is definitely unique.

The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me.

If youve never used a shadow top coat, it is just a shimmery creamy shadow that you apply either as your shadow or over your other shadow to create a glitzed up look. This one is wonderful because the color (mine is Celestial Sparkle) is a lovely ivory color. It is more shimmery instead of glittery. I applied it over my existing eye shadow and it just made my eyes and eye makeup pop. I put it over my lid, next to my lashes and mostly towards my inner eye.

After a one-minute ""application"" with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.

The packages includes:

- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying
- one charging base with power cord
- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels
- one white plastic zippered travel case
- one instruction pamphlet

PROS:

- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a ""cool"" factor to it.

- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a ""tripacer"" (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.

- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.

- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.

- This can be used to remove cosmetics.

- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.

CONS:

- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.

- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.

- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.

- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.

At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",LumaRx facial cleaning brush is like a Sonicare ElectricToothbrush for the face,1456963200,,

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

I have been looking for a replacement & I like to try new things.  This may be it. It does catch all my eyelashes & it does curl them well without making an obnoxious crimp.  It does take a bit of practice if you have always used the traditional metal curlers but it's not difficult.

Because this is plastic, I can't heat it up (w/a hair dryer) like I do with my metal curlers.  I have very straight, hard-to-curl lashes so that was always my trick.  The curl lasted only marginally longer with heating & it seems to be about the same with this curler.  This curler beats my other curlers (I have a drawer full!) for the proper shape & non-crimping/more natural curl.  This is the closest I have come to the Shu Uemura.

I didn't realize the moisturizer in this set was the same as the single one I had ordered as well. Ah. Well. I guess I'm just set on facial moisturizers for life. Or maybe I can gift the other one!

Again, I didn't realize this set was geared towards men but it's okay!

The face wash is nice. Using female products sometimes is a hassle since you don't know what things will smell like (like my Simple exfoliate --- smells like really strong hair dye) or how your skin will react to the product. I like how the face wash didn't dry out my skin nor did it have any strange strong smell. Also this bottle will last me a good amount of time!

The toner I don't use too often since I'm not exactly sure what it's for and because my skin gets really dry I'm scared that it will dry it out even more or you know... sting since I'm not sure if my skin has cracked or not. But I do love the scent of this! Again, the bottle is a good amount so it'll last you awhile.

To test just how 'unisex' it is, I conducted a mini experiment where I asked friends to smell a sample and try to determine if it was a 'male' or 'female'. The results were expectedly mixed, with some leaning towards male and some leaning towards female. No one was especially passionate about one side or the other and when they discovered it was a 'unisex' scent there wasn't much surprise. Personally, I think it is more feminine than masculine.

What leaves me underwhelmed is how un-signature this fragrance is. Call me cheesy, but I like to select unusual colognes and even mix together favorites. I also want a fragrance that conveys images of mystery and intrigue, or at least convey SOMETHING. It doesn't have to be ultra masculine, in fact I've even mixed in some of the less sweet perfumes before. I think this fragrance is just kinda bland. By aiming to be neither male or female, it ends up being nothing. Like a clothing store where too much perfume and cologne have been sampled and they mix together into a bland mix of nauseous.

It does make me a little nauseous, too. A small spray goes a LONG way and too much is not flattering. I find myself almost being scared to use it because I'm afraid it'll end up being too much.

OVERALL: Not bad smelling, but it is strong and it doesn't have a lot of personality. Use in moderation and you'll smell nice, but I doubt you'll get any complements. The one area where it might work best is in a business professional environment, where a musky cologne is too overbearing and a flirty perfume is too sensual. For that, a more neutral pleasantness could be appreciated - but remember it's STRONG and nothing is worse than strong fragrance in a close-quarter work environment.","Professional, Bland Unisex Scent",1463184000,2.0,

Then tap the setting powder into the cap and apply with the powder brush.  The hard part is just using a tiny amount.  If you go heavy handed youll be shining a spotlight on wrinkles and crevices. Then you use the setting spray by spritzing it into the sponge, tapping the damp sponge into the powder in cap and gently dabbing onto covered facial area. After a few minutes brush the area a few times.

The main active ingredient, supplamine, is a combination of two aminos that work together to  treat glycation.  Glycation is a major cause of skin aging, and is cause by sugars attaching to collagen and elastic, creating inflammation and less resilient skin.  Supplamine not only prevents the toxic sugars from being made, but it also works to neutralize existing toxic sugars.

I have rather sensitive skin, and many anti-aging products have caused irritation and stinging when I apply it.  This serum hasn't caused any problems for me in terms of discomfort or irritation.

Overall, it's fine if you like a lighter lotion, but, in my mind, the 15% shea butter in this doesn't justify the cost of this, and there are better, more moisturizing shea butter lotions out there (such as some of the Ahava, Body Shop, Shea Moisture, and African Skin Solutions lotions) for a lower cost.",Name is misleading -- it's not that rich and is a bit tacky,1403136000,2.0,

Part of why I like to mix my scents is because I'm rarely 100% satisfied. Perfume these days tend to be either too sugary and sweet or too old-fashioned and flowery. Adding a musky cologne can tone down an overbearing perfume and, alternatively, a hint of sweet perfume can make a cologne less intimidating.

The reason that I have chosen to give 'Sensuelle' 5 stars is because I feel like it is pretty much perfect as is. There is a brooding darkness that lingers just underneath the floral overtones that is the perfect combination of naughty and nice. I like that they describe the blackcurrant as 'tart' because there are some notes of bitter grapes. The floral aspects are indeed sensual, but in a youthful modern way. It's very much a strong, powerful businesswoman fragrance. It's not something I would wear to the club. It smells too important for leisure and frivolities.

My only warning is that you should not overuse this fragrance. A little goes a LONG way. Too much will have a dizzying effect that will be counterproductive to the mystique that makes it work so well. The bottle is simplistic, but perfect. This fragrance doesn't have a gimmick or celebrity sponsor, it's just classy. The dark, purplish blue color of the bottle is an excellent representation of the scent in a hue.

OVERALL: To be honest, some of Lacoste's fragrances have left me underwhelmed. This one, however, is worth trying.

We were encouraged to see that this is put out by Guthy Renker, a well-known producer and marketer of high quality products over a lot of years. We first ran into the company back in the day, when they put out Tony Robbins' ""Personal Power"" series, and we used their teeth-whitening system as well.

From the female of the family -- I'm willing to spend good money on ""anti-aging"" products as long as they work (although there's really no such thing. You try and be the best you can for your age!). I was given a sample of ""Crepe Erase"" to review and I'm grateful, because I'd have to see a lot of 5-star reviews before I'd spend the money. Having said that, when it works, I'll dish out the dough -- I'm worth it!

I have used this daily for two months before I wrote the review, as you need time with something like this to prove that it works. I'm in my early 60s, and I can definitely see the signs of aging, and the reduction in youthful collagen that causes especially female skin to get that loose and ""crepey"" look.

This is a 2 step Treatment to tighten and smooth the skin. My impression: the Crepe Erase duo really do smooth thin, aging skin on the back of hands, arms, legs and neck area. The fragrance is fresh -- a light citrus. The treatment starts with an exfoliating scrub that buffs away dead skin, leaving the body smooth and clean. I only use the exfoliator every third or fourth day since it takes about that long for skin to shed a layer of cells. Skin remains buffed and smooth for several days.

The hydrating cream (""Intensive Body Repair Treatment"") is great to use every day. Living in arid Arizona, I have dry skin on my lower legs that I continually battle. Crepe Erase has helped with this, and I truly think it has reduced that look of crepey skin around my knees and upper legs. I love how the body cream works all day and doesn't quit before my next shower. I discovered many of my favorite ingredients in the cream; shea and coconut butter, coconut oil, olive oil and beeswax. One excellent ingredient in the duo is apple extract -- antioxidant and astringent, possessing a natural alpha hydroxy acid that helps remove dry skin. The acid-wash action of both the body polish and the cream work well for me. I am a long-term fan of exfoliating with alpha hydroxy acid because it's an easy method and does not require undue scrubbing, which can be hard on the skin itself. With the rich, long lasting and effective ingredients in the body cream, this is a winning combo for me.

By the way, there's no paraben and mineral oil in this, which are contraindicated these days.

The packaging is a glass bottle (not plastic) with a pump that lets you dispense just a tiny amount, which is very nice.  However the clear plastic top that sits over the dispenser was not on tight and some product had leaked out on to the bottle and inside the cardboard box.  Not a lot, but enough to warn against packing this in a travel bag or makeup bag.

The web site does not provide any information about ingredients.  This does not contain any sunscreen, so will be relegated primarily to night time use.  The list of ingredients is printed on the box, and this contains the usual things -- for example dimethicone, glycerin, talc, mica, PEG 10-15 cross polymer, butylene glycol, silica, fragrance, among others.  It does not state whether it is paraben free, which suggests it is not.

The color I received, No 4, is a light-medium shade that is on the cool side, without any yellow or pink undertones.  The fragrance is negligible.

On the skin this feels like it is at least partly silicone based, rather than  cream based.  It has very good slip but still covers quite well, without feeling at all heavy or oily.  I usually use tinted moisturizer with SPF during the day -- and sometimes I further mix that with regular facial moisturizer when I apply.  Not generally a fan of ""coverage,"" so was pleasantly surprised to see that you can control this and attain a very natural finish.

I'm shocked. Stunned. I had given up on finding a foundation that I could wear without stinging and irritation - but as a Vine reviewer, this product was offered at no cost in exchange for my honest review, so I thought, what do I have to lose?

So glad I did....YAY!!!! I LOVE THIS!

First, it is very thick, and I thought it would go on heavy or cakey. Neither was the case. It spreads very evenly and nicely, takes very little to give the right touch to the whole face and neck. It smoothed to a silky finish that had me saying to my daughter, ""feel this!"" The coverage was excellent, without dimming the glow of natural complexion.  That has always a disappointment to me in other foundations, as I find that they make one look sort of dead, and more like a natural fiber canvas than a living being. Again, this was not my experience with this product. It evened out my skin tone and softened the lines and wrinkles, it gave a nice ""glow"" and felt wonderful.

As mentioned above, I have sensitive skin, and most liquid makeup and moisturizers make my skin sting, almost immediately, and without stop for hours until I wash it off. Even the stuff specially formulated for sensitive skin has not worked for me -- until this. Not only doesn't it irritate my skin, but I loved the look all day long - and even forgot to remove it when I went to bed. That's how wonderful it is.

The $30 price tag might seem a little much compared to drug store brands, but with the superior nature of the product, it's very much worth it to me. Beyond that, it takes so little to give full coverage by comparison to common store brands that I don't think you'll actually spend more on this.

To sum up: If I could give this 10 stars, I would. Highly recommended.",10 STARS,1488585600,2.0,

I've been using it as directed morning and at bedtime for about a month and have had no negative reactions or results at all. Unfortunately, I have not been able to discern any positive results on my face either. I have some dry spots on the backs of both hands and occasionally apply a dab to those before applying a heavy moisturizer cream to my hands. I have seen an improvement there, but not on my face. It does make my skin feel soft and clean, but so does my much-cheaper aloe vera moisturizer (which I have continued to apply once the toner dries on my face and neck). Results might be more dramatic using several Obagi products together, but they are expensive. I like the product and the fact that most of the ingredients are natural. The scent is mild and dissipates when the toner dries. I have not noticed any tingling sensation on my skin when the product is applied. I have no complaints except that I don't see much in the way of results on my face.
UPDATE: Since I wasn't seeing much improvement on my facial skin, I decided to try using this product on the backs of my hands. I have had very red, itchy blotches on the backs of both hands for a few years now, and they have been getting redder and itchier. I have tried many creams and moisturizers with little improvement, but I'm finding that by dabbing the Obagi product on those areas in the morning and the evening, the redness has been greatly reduced, the itching has stopped, and the ugly dry areas are smoothing out.

I've had some ""crow's feet"" for a while not, but am just starting to notice a couple of ""smile lines.""  I'm 41 and have very fair skin.  I can handle mild discomfort, so thought to myself, ""Why not?""

First, the pain was more intense than I expected, especially around the mouth area.  I tried using a pain relieving cream several minutes before using the laser treatment, but it didn't make it much more pleasant.  In addition, my skin stayed red for quite a long time after each use.  I used the laser at night and expected the redness to fade by morning, but it didn't (good thing I often work from home).  Someone with less fair or les sensitive skin may not have the same problem with redness.  I think I could get used to the discomfort, but I can't use something every night that causes noticeable redness well into the next day.  Most makeup makes my skin break out, so covering up the redness with foundation isn't an option.  Since I couldn't continue using the device, I unfortunately can't comment on the long term effectiveness.

I think before purchasing this item you need to be aware of how it will affect you.  I would suggest trying a laser treatment at a spa so you know what to expect and how your skin will respond.  If it goes well, you'd save money with this device in the long run.  If you don't like the laser treatment or have any side effects, you know not to spend your money on this one.",iluminage Skin Smooting Laser,1453852800,5.0,

It doesn't make sense that it squeezing out of the paintbrush end.  This is just kinda messy and I think with time it will get sorta dried out as you have to push more product out through old dried out product.

The other problem is the color.  I am a brunette with light eyes and skin.  This color was much too yellow and dark for my skin.  But it was the perfect color for my dark blonde with light eyes friend.  Her skin has a natural golden glow to it and this was a perfect match, yep, I was a teensy bit jealous.

The eyelighter is just short of liquid and it blends well becoming nearly invisible when I used a small dab on the back of my hand (I got a lot of color on my arms and hands after spending a weekend at the beach).

There is no perfume in this product, definitely a bonus unless you prefer scented under eyes.

Also, my dry, delicate and easily irritated skin did not react to this product so I would say that it is pretty gentle and would be okay for use on all types of skin.

So, to sum up, here is what I didn't like about this product;

1.  Too dark a color with too much yellow.

2.  Bad package that could get messy after just a few applications.

A strength of this Pigmentclair is that it goes on very thin and light, almost like a serum.  It also doesn't irritate or burn my sensitive skin immediate upon application, as some products do.  It does, however, begin to dry out my skin as the day goes on.

I always check beauty products on the Paula's Choice website, and, while she doesn't review this exact product, she does review its predecessor, which has almost the exact same ingredients.  Here are her comments about it:  ""That's because it contains a high amount of the B vitamin niacinamide, which research has shown can improve excess melanin (skin pigment) production, lessening and potentially eliminating dark spots. The issue is that for many, treating dark spots takes more than one ingredient. To that end, La Roche Posay included phenethyl resorcinol, an ingredient that has some research showing it can help lighten dark spots! That's exciting, but we're skeptical the amount this serum contains is enough to kick in that benefit.  Even if you wanted to bank on the niacinamide alone, we wouldn't advise it due to the amount of alcohol this fragranced serum contains. It's the fourth ingredient, and in this position is likely to cause some amount of irritation that no one's skin needs.""  In this version, alcohol is actually the third ingredient, so its potential to irritate is even higher.  It's no wonder that some reviewers have experienced dry skin.

I have dark spots on my face just from sun exposure over the years.  So far, this hasn't done much to fade them, but I will update this if I use this more.","Feels light and silky, even under makeup -- but be careful if you have sensitive skin",1445731200,3.0,

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

Some come close but the shave will always be inferior to a real blade.

If you are ok with this fact then the LumaRx Foil Shaver is a decent choice.  It is very easy to use and comfortable.  The shave is close enough for general areas such as armpits but it won't wow you with  skin that feels silky smooth.  Most women will find this to be great for daily use but when you really need a close shave a manual is always the best choice.

- Has a built in trimmer that is comfortable to use

Ahava is really a fantastic cream, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. A dab goes a long way, carries a delightful scent, and heals even the driest skin.

[Updated 12/10/2011: Regarding false comments of a political nature, please note: Ahava has done and is doing nothing illegal under international law, or otherwise, regarding its production facilities, regardless of the opinions of pro-Hamas folks. Obviously a campaign is afoot --- having nothing to do with Ahava's products or their quality --- to delegitimize Israel through boycotts like this.

Here are the facts, both historically and according to established international law. There is no final settlement in the disputed territories. The Palestinian contingent has repeatedly rejected at least five final settlements offered by Israel and its predecessors since the 1920s. The last formal proposal came in 2000 although several more attempts since have been made to arrive at final terms between the disputing parties.

Alas, current Palestinian Authority leaders are just as hard line as Hamas. They do not recognize Israel's right to statehood at all, and regularly so state in official media of every kind. A rhetorical question: How should Israel negotiate with people who openly envision another genocide? I have no answer, and those who boycott Ahava clearly do not either.

Historically, the last internationally recognized High Contracting Party in the disputed territories --- now known as the ""west bank,"" as in ""west bank of the Jordan River"" --- was the League of Nations. In 1922, the League established a Mandate for Palestine, entrusting its administration to the British government, which withdrew in 1948. The world's nations voted on this Mandate after World War I, (and Arabian royals in the Hijaz agreed), just as they voted on Mandates for Iraq, Syria, The Lebanon and so on. This land was intended as part of a national home for the Jewish people. The plan established by High Contracting Parties, and therefore international law, remained in force until Britain unilaterally and illegally established Trans-Jordan to appease the Sharif Feisal of Mecca, whose offspring unsuccessfully attempted to rule where originally assigned. The Palestine Mandate to establish a national home for the Jewish people included what is now generally called the ""west bank."" In 1948, after the United Nations recognized Israel as a state, Jordan rejected the settlement offered at that time, attacked the nascent Israel and illegally seized that land against dictates of international law. Jordan illegally controlled the land until 1967.

Jordan then bombed Jerusalem --- despite repeated peaceful Israeli attempts through diplomatic intermediaries to persuade Jordan not to do so. Israel counter-attacked --- a perfectly legal measure under international law for any established, recognized nation that is attacked.

Israel won the land in self-defense, and has repeatedly attempted to reach a final settlement with those people who claim it. Alas, any final settlement between the parties to the dispute must include an agreement to peace between them --- something the Palestinian Authority refuses to do, as this would require recognizing Israel, which it openly and repeatedly states it never will.

Therefore, under international law, Israel's presence in the disputed territories remains legal. Israel stole nothing from Palestinian Arabs. If their leaders choose to reject a final peace settlement, it's a shame. But international law requires that they do so for there to be any final settlement at all, much less a valid one.]

I don't know that it is because of the pad or not, but something works better.  I now curl each eye 2 or 3 times instead of 4/5 times. One time would probably be fine, but I will have to let go of my thought process that I HAVE to do it more than once.  I'm extremely happy that I can cut off a little time in the mornings.

Together, these powerful ingredients target the signs of aging around the orbital bone.

Does it work?  I have used various products with great success, including Lancome, L'Occitane, Tatcha, Strivectin.  I believe this formula is on par with those products although each has its own ""personality"".

Though many people have noted a reduction in wrinkles, that is more what the LED attachment (not included) is for.  If you have seen med spa advertisements for a ""lunchtime face lift,"" they are talking about microcurrent facials.

The NuFACE is easy to use.  You just put a thin coat of the gel on your face, power it up, set it to your desired strength 1-5, and you are off.  My skin is not sensitive.  I started out on 3 but bumped it up to a 5 almost immediately.  When I did it near my jawline I had a slight metallic taste in my mouth, and sometimes I could feel the electricity but it wasn't even strong enough to be called a mild shock.  It felt like a gentle,  rapid tapping and was by no means unpleasant or painful in the slightest.  Most of the time I didn't feel anything at all but the smooth metal balls gliding over my skin.  It is easy to get the timing right but no big deal if you don't.  For problem areas you can even hold it on one spot on your face for awhile without moving it.

I did half my face then asked my daughter to compare.  She quickly guessed which side I had done, stating that my skin looked better.  I personally noticed a bit of a brow lift.  When my husband came home that evening I asked him to take another look at my face and he said he could tell a difference as well.  I also took before and after pictures, and can tell a difference.  I have used it for three days now.  It is really easy to work into my routine.  I just wash my face in the morning, do the NuFACE for about 5 minutes, wipe the gel off, and go on about my day.

I decided to do some research on microcurrent as a beauty treatment, and found that it has been around for many years and popular with the Hollywood set.  The level of electricity mimics what is present in the human body anyway, though that decreases with age, so it is completely safe for most of us.  People with pacemakers should not use it, people with thyroid issues should avoid the thyroid area, and everyone should avoid using it on the chest area to avoid getting your heart out of rhythm.  Microcurrent started out as a medical treatment as a pain therapy and also to help people suffering from palsy or stroke to lift their drooping facial muscles back in place.  It stimulates your body to produce more collagen and more amino acids, both which lead to a more youthful and lifted appearance.  If you read unbiased reviews such as by users on YouTube, etc., you will see that pretty much everyone loves it.  The NuFACE is not as strong as the ""lunchtime face lift"" microcurrent treatments advertised by med spas, but that just means it takes longer to see the full effect, not that they are less effective.  And five minutes at home each morning is easier, less time-consuming and less expensive than med spa treatments twice a week for six weeks, which is the recommended start up treatment, with less frequent follow-up treatments thereafter.  NuFACE does not interfere with facial injections such as Botox or Juvederm, though you should not use any microcurrent treatment for about two weeks after having the injections.  After that it is business as usual, and there is some evidence that microcurrent actually makes the injectables last longer and helps to reduce the amount needed.

Yes, the NuFACE is expensive and is not for everyone.  However, if you have been tempted by the ""lunchtime face lifts"" or regularly get med spa treatments, or are just really not pleased with the signs of aging on your face and are willing and able to invest that kind of money, NuFACE is an excellent way to bring back some of the youthful skin tone, fullness and tightness.  It is a hefty initial investment, but check out the unbiased reviews for yourself, do your own research, and figure you can spend that cash now for a piece of equipment you can use quickly and easily in your own home for years, or you can get a handful of spa treatments that will last at the most a few months.",Med spa technology at home,1438300800,283.0,

The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",Great soap - but soapy scent,1476835200,3.0,

Yes, it hydrates the skin very well, but not with satisfaction. The cream is thick, heavy, and doesn't absorb very well. If I happened to get too much, I couldn't do anything else but to smear it out more to other areas of the face. There were some mornings I woke up and the skin underneath the eye lashes was so itchy, but I wasn't 100% sure if the eye cream causes it.

Another lesson to learn from this product is that eye cream lasts very long because I use very little st a time, so I should never buy the jar package again as it's not very sanitary over a long period of time.

I've tried lots of matte foundations (and foundations in general), from both high end lines and drugstore brands.  Every one looked like a terrible, dull mask.  This La Roche-Posay foundation is awesome, though!

It's a mousse that you squeeze from a tube, so it's not drippy.  It has a whipped air texture that glides over the skin. It's not heavy or thick at all, but it makes my skin look PERFECT. I've been using it for about a week now and really can't get over how good my skin looks.

As for the shade, ivory is darker than I expected.  I have pale skin, but I never wear ivory (typically, the lightest shade in a range).  I'm usually a few shades darker. However, in this brand it's just right.  There is no pink in it. It has more yellow-neutral undertones.

The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",Not just for men!,1526515200,3.0,
33240,5,False,"12 13, 2014",A3IE8PNBE2LPJE,B00JKOV3JE,,lapis,"With all the complaints in these reviews about how difficult and messy application is, I expected the worst. What I found, instead, was completely fine! But let me start with the results. I'm an extreme skeptic about eye treatments in general, because I think they cost a lot for results I don't really see. I genuinely was not expecting much from this one either, but when I took off the tissue, the results were dramatic. I have olive skin and am prone to puffiness and darkness around my eyes. This eye treatment made the area around my eyes dramatically better. I took before and after pictures just to be sure I wasn't imagining it. The effect seems to last for at least a few hours.

Now in terms of the application, it seems to me that the product designers had this challenge of how to put the serum that they know works under the eyes for a period of time. Tissue paper itself would probably disintegrate while a sponge material wouldn't stay in place on your face. They came up with what feels a bit like rice paper. When you see it in the package, it looks much sturdier and more sponge-like than it is. I accidentally nicked off a piece of one because I didn't realize how fragile it was. But it really is the perfect vehicle for the liquid. I don't see how it is hard to apply, like others have said. You just pour a bit on to saturate and then put it under your eyes. And that's where you can see the application really works. When you put it on your face, it looks like how you'd imagine putting a wet tissue on your face would look. It holds to your face completely. Is it a liquid? Yes, so you need to pour it while standing over a sink, but that's not a big deal. And you want to be careful not to pour too much over just the first pad. But they give you plenty for both eyes in a vial. And with practice, I imagine being able to conserve enough for two applications per vial. But of course, I wouldn't have enough of those cool rice paper pads. The serum has no smell and is not sticky. It has the consistency of water.

The price, of course, is the downside. It's about $12/treatment. But for events, or for days where you wake up looking awful, yes. This stuff is worth it.","It works -- and No, it's *not* hard to apply",1418428800,,

This is a pump bottle, and pressing the button on top squirts out a stream of the heavenly lotion.  You can aim it to get the lotion exactly where you want it, since the stream is thin and the lotion comes out with pinpoint accuracy.

Now to describe this light, subtle fragrance.  The jasmine is the first topnote to meet my nostrils.  And everyone loves jasmine.  A white rose is the next note. I would have chosen water hyacinth as the middle note, although this mentions sandlewood (which would be a bassnote) and lemon for the middle note. And yes, the lemon is there, but I had to search for it, which is for me unfortunate as it is the most favorable note in fragrances for my body chemistry.

There is also something of water, clean laundry, sunshine, with rainclouds on the horizon.  The lemon peeks out in the dry down.  The initial happy aroma quickly dies down into a skin scent.  What is left is a silky, watery moisture drenching my thirsty skin, and I keep putting my arm to my nose to inhale the soft, delicate sunny scent.  And I love the artistic, subliminally phallic bottle.  It's not only gorgeous, it's suggestive, especially with the unsubtle word ""BODY"" on it.

This is a review for a large Mason Pearson brush made of eight rings mixed boar bristle and nylon. The longer bristles are nylon and the shorter ones are boar bristle. It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.

All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.

There are two things you need to know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort.  One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you'd do better with a larger size.

The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want a mixed bristle brush like this one that is part boar bristle and part nylon? What is most comfortable and performs the best with your hair. This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick. Otherwise, you'll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. Mason Pearson also makes an All Boar Bristle Brush for finer or shorter hair but I have never tried it.

So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair. I bought it for myself but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won't reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs. My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair. This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it's worth it. If you're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost. That's how we did it :)

I tried SO many products I can't even list them all.  Serums, mousses, beach sprays, etc.  I did have some success with Philip B's Maui Wowie spray, but then I tried this.

It's amazing. It's not like you suddenly have big hair, it just feels like the strands have a thickness to them but not weighed down at all.  I use it on towel dried hair before I style or air dry.  A little goes a long way so this will last for some time. It especially helps at the top of my scalp where I was seeing a lot of scalp and not enough hair.

Voila - it was quite the ""quick-fix"" for her problem.

She gently applied a thin layer over the scar (which is pink) against her very pale skin -- and this color matched her skin tone well. She waited a few minutes and then built more coverage with a couple of extra strokes. Then, following the directions, she set the foundation by applying a coat of transluscent face powder. You can barely see any blemish as the coverage is great. It makes her feel much more confident and that makes me happy too!

I'm not sure how well this item would do for extensive disfiguring blemishes, but it works well on the fairly superficial ones.

DO pay attention to the recommended heating levels. My hair used to fine; is more in the middle now.  But when I couldn't get the curls to stay I turned it up to max but it left weird crimping in my hair... I'm hoping it's not damaged now although it seems fine after washing.  I've never had a curling or flat iron do that, so I know it can go up higher than most, which is great if you need that level but no so great if you aren't being careful!

I love the grip... it's sensitive to your touch, so if you aren't using it for three minutes it will turn off; otherwise it can sense you are holding it and it stays on. It's easy to turn on and see what temperature you are at (and it has three color levels for even easier remembrance); and the biggest thing... you can't easily adjust the temperature WHILE you are curling. I've had major issues with my irons turning off on other models just by gripping it. Not with this one at all.

The hot part is a bit smaller than most flat irons, but it did such a nice job smoothing out my ""easy to frizz"" straight hair that I didn't care. Made it sleek and smooth.

Overall I am super, super happy... and the quality is top notch!

*A note on flat iron curling:  Take a small piece of your hair, and starting 3/4 of the way up, GENTLY grip the hair and rotate it AWAY from your head one full turn. Slowly pull it down the length of the hair and it gives you beautiful, loose and ""beach"" curls.  If you find it kinking, it's because you are gripping your hair too tight; be gentle!  If the lower part only curls, then you need to go slower at the top to allow it to curl more. Pretty easy!*","Can get SUPER hot... easy to grip, great for curls and straight hair alike!

Results are not instantaneous, but require weeks of consistent treatment, so when people say it is all that and a bag of chips, what they see in the mirror is what they wish to see.  That being said, this tool appears to do what it claims to do, stimulate the collagen which plumps up slight wrinkles in facial skin over bone, and anything else is a byproduct of the attention the user is likely also giving to their skin while using the Tria.

Try the Tria on your cleansed and dried off forearm to be sure you recognize the prickly sensation that will be felt on the face.  Use it on a cleansed and dried off face, avoiding the eyes, staying on areas that cover bone, following a four sectioned or zoned order.  I have found that as suggested in the Tria online video, I prefer to move the device vertically along my forehead area and horizontally along the remaining three zones.  I then use a facial serum and moisturizer to rehydrate the skin and I drink a glass of water to rehydrate my interior.  It is suggested to perform this ritual five out of seven nights a week prior to bed for twelve weeks, raising the stimulation from one to three as you can tolerate the prickling sensation.  Stimulation is increased with the levels as is the timing for eachieving zone.  My sensitive skin showed no adverse reaction at any stage, that is no redness, darkening or burning.  I also religiously apply sunscreen during the day and would do this if I did nothing else to my face.

This is a good tool and becomes easier to use over time because it becomes second nature to move the laser area along the face.  For the first few nights, I found that I had difficulty getting it to move smoothly and if it did not touch the skin, the laser stopped working.  Initially, that was frustrating, then I discovered that by assuring that my skin was completely dry after being cleansed and then carefully regulating the pressure with which I moved it across my face, the two minute treatment went by as quickly as the two minute cycle of my electric toothbrush.  Like my toothbrush, the Tria alerts me when a zone is completed at each increment.  Unlike the toothbrush, this turns itself off at the end of a treatment cycle.  I can lock the device and then unlock it by holding down the power button for a few seconds, a safety feature I appreciate.  My Tria arrived with no lotions or potions, just the device, charging cradle, USB cord for the cradel and plug for the USB cord.  Enclosed was a little purple folder containing the instruction manual.

This tool is not cheap and considering the battery is expected to last perhaps three years tops, it is not for everyone.  If you typically spend a substantial amount of money on skin care products, estheticians and spas, I won't advise against trying this.  As for me, the true test will be hearing what my Dermatologist says at my next biannual visit.  The Tria won't rid my skin of the effects of time, age and sun damage, but if it continues to help plump up those tiny wrinkles with my own collagen, I'm not complaining.",Not a miracle worker,1433548800,8.0,

The product is packaged in an attractive teal box.  The system itself is encased in rather cheap looking plastic and contains a separate power cord, three diamond heads and some filters. There is an adequate dvd that should be viewed prior to use. It is easy enough to set up although the heads are hard to remove.

First you decide which area of the face or body you are going to treat. You then choose which tip to use: normal for body and less sensitve areas, fine for face and sensitve areas or precision for delicate and hard to reach areas such as around the lips and nose. A small disposable filter is placed between the device and the head. Choose the level of suction--I never used anything greater than the first level.  Holding the skin taut, you then glide the head across the area two or three times. The skin is sucked into the vacuum where the diamond tip exfoliates.

I have mildly sensitive skin and found this device a bit rough. Although the DVD states that pinkness is to be expected and will disappear after a short time, I found mine lasted into the next day. I decided to use the device only once a week as opposed to the recommended two to three times a week sugested. My device also did not go over my skins as smoothly as demonstrated in the instruxtional dvd. Based on my reaction to the more gentle tips, I did not use around my eyes.  I did see results.  After the first treatment, my skin was velvety soft. After seven weeks of one use per week, I did notice some slight refinement overall. This year, I developed a small but annoying  line over my lips. It is like a light smoker's line (although I've never smoked), It probably annoys me more than it should. It has diminshed but not disappeared.

I would avoid this machine if you have very sensitve skin or adjust your usage as I did. This may delay the results. Overall softness was the most noticeable benefit although there were other small improvements. I would have preferred a retractable, longer power cord. The tips should be replaced after ten uses and the filters must also be replaced. So factor in the associated costs. (You can get the parts on amazon.)I did not experience the suction loss others complained about. I wish the tips were easier to remove and were marked in different colors.

This is a pricey machine. It does afford one convenience and privacy and is less expensive than repeated spa visits. It is easy to use and I did enjoy some positive results, most noticeably, increased softness. If you have delicate or very sensitive skin I would not risk it.

40n Bronze. I was offered this shade and while it is darker than i would normally use I found it a suitable shade for when I am going for a more intense appearance. I am looking forward to working through all the shades in my spectrum (Beige to Toast - the industry standard names while useful are so unflattering).

For reference, my hair is shoulder blade length, not too thick, mostly straight with a little wave and some tendency to frizz. This produced lovely beachy waves, truly similar to what I see when I've let my hair dry in a bun at the beach, but smoother and shinier.

My only disappointment was the tendency for the waves to fall out quite a bit over the first couple of hours. Perhaps using a strong hairspray rather than a sea salt spray would hold more (though I think I'd like it less) as well as using maximum heat, though I felt setting 4 out of 5 should be adequate for my hair texture.

The shape of a curling wand really lends itself to a natural looking style and getting more of the length of my hair in contact with the barrel. Yes, you have to wrap your hair around and hold the tips in place, so there's more risk of a burn if you aren't careful. The glove protects well, though it made it harder me to deal with the hair, so I tend to take my chances without it. The technique is different than a curling iron, but I didn't find it too difficult to master.

For the money, you're getting a beautiful and high quality instrument. The ability to change out the barrel for other styles will be valuable to some, if it's worth paying for more; I'll stick to this one. I think the ceramic and tourmaline really contribute to shininess. I also like the ability to select a temperature. If you have never used a wand, I'd suggest starting with something lower cost to see if you like using this shape of wand. But if you're ready to invest in a great one, I have no cautions about this selection.","Smooth, shiny, natural looking waves",1446163200,2.0,

----------------------

I have been using and exploring skin care for quite some time now, so I have had a chance to use many different brands at a wide variety of price points.  Let's see how Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex compares to the creams I have used.

WHAT TYPES OF CREAMS HAVE I USED
Some of the creams that I have used are as follows
Lancome Absolue
Lancome Renergie Multi Action
Algenist Firm and Lift
Algenist Genius
Loreal Vitalift
Yes to Blueberries
L'Occitane
SKII
L'Oreal Genesis
LaPrarie
Clarins
Christian Dior (variety of them)
Chanel
Shiseido

The above list only reflects some of the brands I have had a chance to explore and test out.  Keeping this in mind, I will compare this cream for effectiveness and what results it achieves.

WHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?
Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex is indicated to be for mature skin that is post menopausal.  That means that the targets are for plumping skin, shrinking pores, radiance, making skin feel denser (thus more youthful), contours, and more of an even tone to skin.  This cream does not have SPF in it which I am THRILLED about.  If you want to use SPF, then you can put it on yourself.

The jar is glass another feature that I like.  It has a tight fitting cap with an inner seal which helps the cream from drying out.  The color is a beautiful iridescent peach color glass and the cream inside is an icy peachy pink color.  It is a bit thicker than the night version of this cream&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vichy-Neovadiol-Replenishing-Care-Night-Cream-1-69-fl-oz/dp/B017R8MYGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vichy Neovadiol Replenishing Care Night Cream, 1.69 fl. oz.</a>.

HOW DOES THIS CREAM PERFORM?
When applying this cream, it is extremely lightweight- not at all thick and sticky like you might expect.  It goes on easily and absorbs VERY quickly into the skin.  The best way to put it on is to dot about a lentil to pea sized dot on each quadrant of the face and then spread it into the skin.  There is a very heavy scent to this, which I have to be honest at first with the night cream made me want to retch, but I quickly got used to it.  Many people would probably find it pleasant, but at first it was hard to get used to.

I have used this with the night cream at night so the combination of the action is to be considered.  I find that the cream leaves my skin very plump, glowy, moisturized for 12 hours until I use the night cream, and there is absolutely no sticky residue.  I find that it does seem to work best when I apply&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Natural-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Liquid/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99% Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Liquid</a>&nbsp;on BEFORE any moisturizer and after cleansing the skin.  I use this with all skin care as it improves performance greatly.

This skin care line will enable you to have a much better canvas to use makeup on for older women.  I do makeup on older women quite often and one of the biggest problems is not using really good skin care first.  This skin care (along with the night cream) will greatly improve the skin so that makeup application will be much nicer and less apt to look caked on.

I would say that this is an excellent skin care line for mature skin if you can tolerate the fragrance.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM
Excellent price for what you get
Glass jar
A little goes a long way
It is not sticky
Absorbs quickly
Differences begin quickly
Does what it promises

WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM
Fragrance is a bit overbearing.

THE BOTTOM LINE
I have to say compared to the other lines of skin care that I have tried over the years on myself and on others whose skin I work on, this line of Neovadiol Compensating Complex is a serious contender for performance with good price range compared to high end.  I would put it in the same ball park as some of Lancome, Algenist, Dior, SKII, and I find it even better than some Chanel, Shiseido, Clarins, and L'Oreal (although this company appears to have ties with L'Oreal).  I really do not like the heavy scent, but I did get used to it.  It does not make my eyes water, and it fades away quick enough to be able to use it.  For the price vs performance, compared to other lines, I have to say this is a five star, although I am tempted to give it four stars due to the fragrance.

If you or someone you know has mature skin this would be a great cream to try out to improve makeup application and skin appearance.",How Does This Compare To Other Lines Of Skin Care For Mature Skin? - A Professional Makeup Artist's Perspective (UPDATE),1460246400,30.0,

However, the price really is a deciding factor for me when considering the Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base, especially considering that it's less than an ounce in size and doesnt replace foundation makeup.

I tested this by using it on one side of my face and following my usual daily regimen on the other side, and I could definitely feel a difference.  They started out very similar, but the Water Canvas Base side stayed smoother throughout the day and did provide a better base for makeup.  The results weren't astounding, but they were noticeable.

However, Id have to see a much bigger difference before I would consider this to be worth using regularly at this price point.  For under $20, I would probably add it to my makeup routine.  For over $40, I wouldnt even consider it.",Doesnt do enough to make it necessary,1393372800,,

This is a high-end luxury brush that truly delivers.

There are two things you need to know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you'd do better with a larger size.

The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want all nylon, like this Detangler? Even though the Detangler is all nylon, some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter, just like the mixed bristle brush. It's hard to see in the picture. You should know that the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a bristle brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.

The Detangler is a brush just like the other brushes, not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing. It is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also. Even though my hair is very short, it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick. This handy size is about eight inches long.

It's quite a large expense to buy any Mason Pearson product compared to other manufacturers of hair care items--it's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it's worth it. If you're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost. That's how we did it :)

For those who can afford the 'gimmick' of measured doses through capsules, it's a nice way to put the perfect amount onto your skin.  But at the same time, knowing how much waste goes into this is also a bit frustrating and I wished there was a little spatula rather than capsules.

To use, each capsule has a little tab on top to break off and then squeeze the premeasured amount onto your fingertip.  You then spread this across the areas that could use some wrinkle reduction - e.g., eyes and mouth lines.  This is for fine lines, of course - it won't remove all lines or the deeper wrinkles. But in reducing the smaller wrinkles, you will notice a difference.

This has a light and not problematic scent - you won't notice its on once it seeps into skin.  I put this on under makeup just fine.

Always made me feel weird; always afraid of getting stuff in my eyes or other places with the body scrubs, so they've often been a turn off for me.  This winter slapped me with some major dry, bumpy T Zone skin, so I gave in and tried this.  It's not bad.  It is gritty, but not too abrasive feeling and has a pleasant odor.

As other reviewers have mentioned, it is not like a typical face scrub instead it is a creamy scrub with strawberry seeds as an exfoliant.  I love the smell and texture of this scrub even when I have breakouts because it is gentle on my skin.  I find that Mario products are very natural and I have never had an issue with any of their products causing a negative reaction with my skin.

It is important to me to use high quality products because I believe that in the end good quality products will pay for themselves!  When I use quality products in the MB line, I am always happy with how my skin feels and this particular product is one of my favorites!  I usually buy mine directly from the Mario website since they run promotions where they send goodie bags of free samples.","Amazing scrub, amazing smell--an all around winner!",1438819200,4.0,

The skin around  my eyes is definitely  more moisturized which makes my makeup go on more evenly in this area. I am 33 years old and have mild lines and  some puffiness but i did not really see any reduction in either  after weeks of use, twice a day. I give 3 stars because  the added moisture has made my eyes seem brighter and I do like that. But i have to take away stars because it does claim to  reduce puffy eyes and  fine lines, which I do not see personally. I kept waiting to review  to give it more time, but i think after 2 weeks I have been fair.","Youth eye serum is a good moisturizer, not sure about other claims.",1489449600,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718NQ1sL2TL._SY88.jpg']

A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol.

My favorite part is the cool feeling when you put it on your face. The minute it hits my face I always feel a bit more refreshed than I did previously.

I tend to shower twice a day (I like the water) so I can't speak much about the long lasting nature of the hydration but I can speak to how my skin feels and reacts to it. I have terrible skin which consistently breaks out into rashes, eczema, and all sorts of other issues. This product has no negative effects on my skin and I noticed it tended to get less dry than it usually does. My wife is usually trying to get me to put on lotion when she sees it get into that state so it's been a bit of a relief for her since I started using this since it hasn't yet.

The product is pricy but it seems like it's a high quality one so I could see it being worth it to some people.

From the product page above: ""Founded in France in 1931, Vichys formulas combine clinically-proven ingredients with mineral-rich volcanic water to deliver real results to women of all ages.""

I can attest it works well for men in their 30s as well. Definitely love the Vichy brand as does my wife. You know you're getting a quality face product when it's there. I can't say the same for other (often cheaper) brands I've tried which tend to cause my skin to go haywire or do nothing at all.",Refreshing facial moisturizer,1468627200,2.0,

The color is very nice, though with maybe a hint too much orange for me. It blends beautifully and covers very well. I have a mole on my face that it mostly covered, but it did very well relative to other coverups I've tried.

I used it on my face, one hand and wrist. I was not only impressed by the color and coverage, but by how water resistant it was. I wore it on my face and had to wash it off with a little soap or makeup remover after about six hours. (I tried both. They both worked.) On my hand it lasted just a few hours, but I washed my hands several times and was impressed by how long it did.

There is no smell. It blends well but you can use a drop of water to help it too. It does not make your skin greasy, oily or dry. It has a very natural look and feel.

I love that it's SPF 30. I only wear high-ish SPF skin products anymore.","great color, excellent coverage and feel, lasts a while",1497225600,,
