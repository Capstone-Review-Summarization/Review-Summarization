Step by Step
CHOOSING FABRICS. Rit works best on many natural, washable fabrics and materials, such as: a. 100% cotton, linen, silk, wool, ramie
b. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon
c. Fiber blends with at least 60% cotton or other dyeable fiber (blends will tint evenly but will not achieve full color)
d. Nylon-based plastic such as those found in buttons, fasteners and lacrosse sticks
e. Natural materials such as wood, wicker, paper, feathers and cork But there are fabrics and materials that will not accept dye, such as: a. 100% polyester, acrylic, acetate, fiberglass, spandex and metallic fibers
b. Fabrics with rubber backing (bath mats or throw rugs)
c. Fabrics with special finishes such as water repellents
d. Fabrics with bleach damage or extensive staining
e. Fabrics washable only in cold water or labeled dry clean only
f. Polyethylene plastics such as golf discs
g. Polycarbonate plastics such as eyeglass frames
Fiber content and weight also effect how color appears making fabrics like cotton, wool and silk absorb dye differently, slightly changing the hue and brightness of the chosen color. If you are in doubt as to whether your fabric will accept dye or achieve the color you want, we recommend testing a swatch.
DYE PREP. Cover work area with a plastic table cover or newspaper and have paper towels or sponges handy to protect against any possible spills.
Wear rubber gloves to protect hands from getting stained and to insulate them when working with hot water.
Use plastic buckets or stainless steel pots for the dye bath. You can also dye in a stainless steel sink. Dont dye or rinse items in a porcelain or fiberglass sink or tub as they are likely to get stained./p>
ACHIEVING TRUE COLOR. Always follow manufacturers care instructions for your fabric as well as Rit Dye package or bottle instructions.
Remove stains on fabric or use Rit Color Remover before dyeing to get fabric to an off-white or cream color. This will help achieve uniform color results when dyeing.
Dissolve powder dye thoroughly in 2 cups of very hot water first to avoid dye spotting. Stir dissolved powder dye or well-shaken liquid dye into dye bath until evenly dispersed. Never pour liquid or powder dye directly on fabric unless looking to achieve a specific creative effect.
Be sure to use enough dye for the weight or size of the project. For example, for a pound of dry fabric (about 3 yards), use one package of Rit powder or 1/2 bottle of Rit liquid in 3 gallons of water. You want enough water for the fabric to move freely in the dye bath so that it can absorb the dye evenly across the garment.
When dyeing 1 pound of dry fabric in dark or bright colors such as Black, Dark Brown, Cocoa Brown, Navy, Purple, Wine, and Dark Green, use double the amount of dye (2 packages of Rit powder or 1 bottle of Rit liquid) in 3 gallons of water.
For the deepest color, use a water temperature of 140F/60C and keep heat constant while dyeing (the stove top method or a washing machine work best). Note: If tap water is not hot enough, heat water on the stove, in a teakettle or in the microwave.
If dyeing a garment more than one color, its usually best to start with the lightest color and move to the darkest.
For more intense color when dyeing fabrics containing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup salt to the dye bath. When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup white vinegar to the dye bath. If possible delay adding the salt or vinegar until 5 minutes after the fabric has been in the dye bath. The delay will help to promote level dyeing.
Add 1 tablespoon laundry detergent to all dye baths to help promote level dyeing.
The longer the garment is immersed in the dye bath, the deeper the resulting color. Items can remain in the dye bath up to 1 hour as long as the water remains hot. Youll also have to make sure the item receives constant agitation or stirring.
Garments will also look darker when wet and prior to washing.
When you remove clothes from dye bath, rinse in warm, then cool water until water runs clear. (Warm water helps to rinse off surface dye more effectively.)
Wash your fabric/clothes in warm water with mild detergent and then rinse thoroughly in cool water. Machine dry or hang dry.
CARING FOR DYED ITEMS. For the first two or three times, wash your dyed item by itself in cool water with a small amount of non-bleaching detergent. Always wash your dyed clothing with similar colors in cool water with mild detergent. Dry cleaning silks and special fabrics is recommended.
CLEANUP. Clean containers and sinks immediately after dyeing by scrubbing with hot water and powdered cleanser or bleach.
Clean washing machine using highest water level with hot water, detergent and 1 cup chlorine bleach using complete wash cycle. Clean lint traps. Plastic or rubber machine parts may be tinted but will not stain laundry.",Great Buy!,1464220800,19,

I used it to repair a polly pocket doll for my daughter (see pictures). We had tried to glue it previously but it popped open in the repaired spot again, and superglue would've made the legs not bend or the waist twist. I decided to give this stuff a go & it works great to repair the doll.

The front of the polly's waist/pelvis area popped off and inside two legs attach, plus the waist rotates side to side. If you don't glue it right then the legs won't move anymore, nor will the waist twist, so it was a tricky thing to repair (and, of course, this particular polly HAD to be repaired as it was one of my daughter's favorites and no longer sold). I was able to repair the doll body with this stuff w/o sacrificing the movement of it's legs and in a way that it almost can't pop open again. I used a few small balls of it to ""glue"" the previous attachment points inside, then rolled a narrow band of it and put around the outside, sort of like a belt, to further support it staying together. I'm sure I could've worked a bit more and matched the color exactly, but the green I came up with was close enough for us.

re: some of the criticisms on other reviews:

expiration date - who cares? Almost everything has an expiration now days and you can typically ignore that unless it's food you're worried will expire. I can't imagine this stuff is going to suddenly decompose or solidify in their air-tight packets on the expiration date. I'm not worried about this, and if I remember to look June of 2014, I'll update my review to let you know if it did self destruct or whatever people are worried will happen.

Wasted after opening packet - I cut a corner of the packet and used my nail on the outside to push some out of the slit, then pressed it down along the slit where there was still some of the rubbery stuff. Essentially, I didn't let any air into the packet, and the rubbery stuff at the slit resealed it for me. I can squeeze the rest of the packet (away from the slit) and it's stil pliable, so I'll be able to still use the rest. If you open the whole thing up, then of course, it will dry out. Just be careful about how you do it and the rest will not be wasted.

I think this stuff is pretty neat and super handy to have around. I'll keep it on the shelf next ot my duct tape and super glue, as it's one of those type things that can come in really handy, and can fix stuff the other two might not be able to fix. I like that there are colors that can be mixed, and if you're careful you don't have to waste the rest of the packet you open.

Adding white will bring out the orange more. I find that it works beautifully when adding subtle red tones that blends well with Burnt Sienna or Yellow Ochre in portrait or figure painting. It's highly pigmented so a little goes a long way.

The paint has a rich, buttery texture that works well with any painting techniques from thinned out smooth brush strokes to thick impasto palette knife painting.

While Alkyd Oils will dry faster, using mediums such as Linseed oil will negate this quickened drying time. I use Winsor Newton's Liquin when I paint with Alkyds. When I paint impasto, I love using Alkyds. Impasto oil paintings take forever to dry so to have an oil that will actually dry faster gets a painting ready in a more realistic time for exhibition or sale.

Alkyds are great for general oil paintings that dry faster as well as using for an underpainting that will dry faster completely or partially before adding additional color on top of it. These paints will mix easily with standard oil paints as well. They may allow the standard oils it's mixed with to dry a little faster depending on the value, medium used, and thickness of the paint. I haven't really noticed a whole lot of difference when I've mixed the two together.

209889,4,True,"05 9, 2013",AQZN94F4RARB7,B004C04YI8,,Jecca,"I picked up this sewing machine as a gold box deal on Valentine's Day and have now owned it for about 15 months.  I didn't really sew before I purchased the machine and didn't want to spend too much money on a fancy machine in case I decided I didn't like sewing.

At first, it was pretty frustrating.  This machine doesn't do absolutely everything for you like the fancy computerized machines.  I had to learn a lot about thread tension and basic troubleshooting and, of course, ripped out a whole lot of stitches along the way.  If I hadn't been so stubborn when it came to admitting defeat, I might've quit sewing altogether in the first week of using this machine.  But, then things got better.

After I learned the basic concepts of how a sewing machine works, I was able to sew everything I wanted with no trouble.  I've used this to sew several layers of thick fleece, stretchy knits, sheer curtains, and more.  It handled all the materials easily and consistently produced stitches that look good.

Now, the bad.  I have since upgraded to one of those fancy computerized machines that I was hesitant to invest in because I feel I outgrew this machine.  I'm keeping it because it still works perfectly and is a good backup, but I don't use it much anymore.  The biggest problem was a lack of available accessories.  This machine comes with a standard foot and a buttonhole foot.  I ordered a zipper foot on Amazon that said it would fit ""most"" Juki machines but it didn't work for me.  I didn't order more because I didn't want to waste more money.  If you want to do anything other than basic stitching, I'd do some looking for the additional stuff you'll need and figure that cost into the price of the machine.  It quickly becomes pretty expensive if you plan on doing anything requiring more specialized feet.

Next, the size of the machine got very frustrating for me.  In addition to garment construction, I started quilting.  It is so, so hard to quilt a large quilt on this little machine.  My quilting, quite frankly, looked like crap because fighting to feed the quilt through the throat (the tiny space to the right of the needle, if you're new to sewing terms) frequently made my lines crooked and imperfect.  The feed dogs also seemed to need a little more help than usual and, as such, the stitch length isn't perfect, either.

Finally, this machine is LOUD.  I've found that I'm able to get the most sewing done after my young daughter goes to bed but, unfortunately, this machine was so loud that it sometimes woke her up.

I'm glad that I started out with this little machine.  It was great for learning what I'm doing instead of just starting out with a computerized machine that does pretty much everything for me.  I would recommend it to anyone just starting to sew as long as you're paying the gold box price.  The $175 regular price tag is probably a little too much considering the machine's limitations.  Since my purchase, I've seen the machine as a gold box deal several times, usually on gift giving holidays like Valentine's Day, Black Friday, and Mother's Day.",Great machine with some limitations,1368057600,7,

In natural light they look a little more muted than in the photograph. The lavender is a sort of greyish-light purple, and the orange is a sort of orangey-light brown. They have a reasonable amount of wax. The only reason I deducted a star is because after threading a six-foot length of leather with the holes pre-punched (I was making a bow bag), the wax wore off and the thread started to fray and look weak. It also tangled a couple times despite my precautions, but that's probably inevitable and luckily I was able to tease the tangles apart without the thread breaking.

I've noticed two types of colored pencils. One type has a more oily pigment, that will leave a very smooth, dense pigmentation on your paper. The other type, the pigment is a bit harder, so you don't get the dense pigmentation on the paper. These pencils are the second type. They don't leave a sort of white powder over the finished pigment field, the way you might find with the oily colored pencils. Most tints and tones are available, if you mix the colors. For example, lay down the first color very lightly, then use the second color pencil to overlay color over the first. Especially when doing portraiture, you'll find a beautiful range of hues available, as well as tints and shades.
ARRANGING YOUR PALLET
You cant get the colors you need, with them all in the box. Dump the box of pencils out. Next, you'll need to set up your pallet. So you'll want to arrange the pencils into a smooth rainbow. Start with pure blue, place an indigo blue (ultramarine) next to it. Next to that, is pure indigo. Then, a sort of indigo purple, then purple, then plum, then cranberry, scarlet, deep red, red orange, orange, warm yellow, cool yellow, then lime green, pure green, deep green, turquois,  bluish green, etc. This kit contains 22 HUE SATURATION colors.
Next, you'll pick out the earth colors, and skin tones. The kit has 9 SKIN TONES, including a forest green, and a pink color. Finally, you'll find your  5  NEUTRAL COLORS -- white, black, dark grey, light grey, warm grey
22 HUE SATURATION (Rainbow colors)
9 SKIN TONES (burnt and raw umbers and sienna, pink, indian red, golden brown, forest green for shadows.)
Together, you have 36 colors.
NEXT GET A WHITE CARDBOARD BOX
Use a screwdriver, and poke holes in the box. I have a row of WARM SATURATION HUES on one row. Another row of COOL SATURATION HUES, then a row of NEUTRAL COLORS. Finally, stick your flesh tones or earth tones into the box. I use a white cardboard box, so I can scribble a bit of color next to the pencil. The color coded paint on the end of the pencil, doesn't always describe the color of the pencil lead. When you have all your pencils sticking out of a box, or a bit of Styrofoam, each pencil is easy to access. You're unlikely to find a pencil color you need, if you keep these in the box they came in.  Once you have your pallet set up, you'll be ready to go. I keep a pencil sharpener handy. Some people like to use a piece of sandpaper, to keep their color pencil point sharp.  You might even want to keep an eraser nearby too, even though erasing colored pencil doesn't work very well. I have a lot of fun working with this medium.

It did not come with any instructions-you will have to find another source for that if you need it.
Most pieces are very well sanded and smooth.  The shuttle is a bit rough, but sandpaper will take care of that.  The only downer for me, is that the loom is not quite balanced.  It wobbles a bit because one corner is not ""square"".  But for the price you can't really complain-all those parts and a useable little loom for less than 10 dollars.

I really like these calligraphy markers compared to other brands of calligraphy markers.  Each marker is double-sided with one 2mm and one 5mm felt tip.  This is a nice and practical feature.  I prefer to use the small tip most of the time.  This set includes pure red, pure green, pure blue and pure black markers.  The colors are very bright and vivid.  I use these markers for scrapbooking and for writing names on the envelopes of greeting cards and invitations.  The ink is acid free, photo safe and archival quality which makes the markers perfect for scrapbooking.  Calligraphy on envelopes always looks elegant and sophisticated.  I always get compliments on my writings.  Many recipients of my cards and invitations say they save the envelopes.

I would like to note that I used fountain calligraphy pens for many years.  The ink flows smoothly and the writing looks sharp.  However, there are disadvantages to using fountain pens.  First, the ink in fountain pens is not colorfast and fades with time.  Second, the ink I used was not labeled as acid free, photo safe or archival quality.  Third, the ink in the nib will dry and clog the nib if not used for a while.  This was actually my biggest pet peeve.  As I was not using the pens regularly, I would often encounter this problem.  Lastly, fountain pens can sometimes be messy.  They can leak for a variety of reasons.

I highly recommend the Zig Memory System Calligraphy Markers.  I also bought a six pack of black Zig Memory System Calligraphy Markers.  I plan to buy a larger set with more colors in the future.",Good quality calligraphy markers,1404000000,30,

So, kudos to the seller. These pens have amazing color - brilliant and highly pigmented. You MUST read and follow the instructions for how to ""prime"" them. Ordinarily I am so anxious to start using my new art supplies that I simply tear into them and go at it. Fortunately I have purchased pens in the past that needed priming so I was patient and did what is necessary to start the flow of paint. These pens flow beautifully and deposit a perfect load of paint. I purchased the fine point set. They are not fine enough (for me anyway) to write in standard size lettering, however that is not what I purchased them for. For intricate zentangles and mandalas I would probably recommend the extra fine tip although the fine tip will do well in less intricate patterns I believe. They are perfect for doodling and to color in small areas. A friend buys the large size, deposits color on her paper and then smears it with her fingers. I haven't tried that technique with mine.

Not with this specific spool, the perforated label made it so easy, you just push the center paper in with your finger and the spool is ready to sit on the spool holder.

Some people have used this for Christmas tree decorations, treat holders, etc.  The cup is die cut all in one piece which I love because it only has one seam to glue which makes it  easier/faster to put together.  I'm not sure how much longer this will be available since it has been around for quite some time and Sizzix tends to retire dies fairly quickly so if you are thinking of getting this I recommend doing a Google or Pinterest image search to see how versatile this die is. Updated: After I did my review, several months later I bought the David Tutera ""Crease and Curl tool"" sold by Sizzix, it makes it much easier to curl the cup die cut and the base die cut to get a nice round shape. There are not enough tabs in the base die cut to secure it to the cup so there is a tiny gap, hence the ribbon and bow on the product image which disguises that.  I used 1/8"" ribbon and it was perfect. For the handle, the directions show how to use a pencil to curl the die cut strip.",Very happy to have bought this lovely Brenda Walton die,1515974400,,

Since they are over $2 apiece open stock, this appeared to be a great buy. However, be forewarned - this set is not the artist-grade ""Gallery"" line, even though the description says it is. These are Mungyo's student grade, which is an inferior one - not just inferior to the artist grade, but inferior to every other student grade out there, including Pentel's children's line.

First of all, the pastels are extremely hard, which means little color is transferred. The Gallery line is very soft and almost like using a soft dry pastel. Moreover, this student grade crumbs terribly, in fact it's the worst one I've tried regarding leaving tiny crumbs with every single stroke!

The only good thing about this set is it does come in a very nice wooden box. But that's not enough reason to throw away money on these awful crayons. One cannot even call them oil pastels.

237238,4,False,"10 8, 2012",A375NF45A1MDWI,B005OLUU28,,E.S,"First I would state that I am a cricut fan. I have an expression and love it. So when I saw the mini I thought it look great. It arrived in the box with all the contents of power cord, mat, blade, cutter and USB. You have to have a computer to run this cutter unlike the others. The software for altering the sizes etc is on the computer software rather than the machine. I found the cutter easy to set up with plugging in. It arrives with some paper so that you are able to create your first project with ease.

First the mat. It is a different size from all the other mats that their different machines use which in some ways annoys me. However it is the size of an A4 sheet of basic card stock. This is good for the basic papers but for pattern paper most of those are 12 by 12 so you would have to cut the size. As I do with all my mats I patted my hands over the complete surface. The oils on your hands help preserve the mat and the stick. You can find many videos on Youtube about how to make your mats last. I will warn you that some re-sticking techniques do void your warranty.

I had install 2 programs to get my cricut working. First the Adobe Air and then the cricut software. Personally I did not have any issues installing either programs. Once installed I was able to easily complete the project. The computer prompts for the first project the depth and pressure of the blade which are easy to adjust. The machine cut this first project well without issues and I found the paper to remove easily from the mat. I like the software it was easy to navigate and you can manipulate the images on the screen before you cut. It has elements that you can get with the gypsy. As of yet I have not tried it will my other cartridges as you need to link them with the software so that you can get the images. However once you have built up a large number you can search for images.  The software would allow you to move your items around the mat so that you could cut out two colors at once. You can add layers so that you can easily create shadows. It is easy to add multi cuts by pressing the button.

Although it can be viewed as a disadvantage that you need a computer but the software can probably be easily updated in the future. I think this also have the potential of being able to download new carts which would reduce the storage. You can also see the changes on the images large on the computer screen.  In some ways I hope that in future you get the bigger cutting area.

Overall this is a good product. I can see it being something I as a teacher could easily take into school and cut for my classroom without having to carry in huge amounts of cartridges. it is not as bulking in size either. I gave 4 stars for two reasons. One that you have to use a computer and also that is has yet another size of mat. I love the first project that walks you through the steps of how to use the machine

Then the price. When I am writing this it is currently prices at just under $100. The expression 1 is currently priced at just under $170.  Do I think the price is right? I think it depend on what you want to do. If you are mainly going to be doing smaller cuts then this is a great cutter. The software will allow you to create what you need. The machine has limits however because of the size. Also if you always have a computer handy then this machine is fine but if you want a stand alone machine that doesn't need to be hooked up to a computer then one of the others would be better. For $100 this is an easy machine to use and cuts great.",Good cutter,1349654400,7,

I tend to go gung-ho when I find a new crafty hobby I want to sink my teeth into, so I went ahead and bought this comprehensive circular needle set on the insistence of my more advanced knitter friends who advised that 1) I would absolutely need circular needles and 2) that I would save money buy not buying a ton of individual circular needles.

Pros:
These needles are so pretty! They make you want to knit. :)
There really are a ton of sizes, so any project you pick up, you are pretty much guaranteed to have the right sized needles.
The cables can actually be linked together to form an enormously long cable if you need them.
I haven't had any issues with the yarn getting caught on or fuzzed up by the aluminum needles.
I love the carrying case that keeps everything all organized and easy to find. If I didn't have this case I would never have a matching set of needles because they would be strewn in my never ending ""Craft Drawer.""

Cons:
There is nothing. NOTHING. more frustrating to a new knitter than finally getting halfway through your first project to have the cable unscrew and pop off your needle. As a new knitter, this happened to me and I was devastated, because I had no idea how to pick my work back up yet and fix the problem. Ugh. I had to start over and keep obsessively checking the connections each time I started a new row. So, word to the wise: the connections like to unscrew! I started putting masking tape around the connections when I started a new project.

Related - when the connections would start to unscrew a little, my yarn would get caught on them and fuzz a little.

All in all, this set is an excellent gift for a beginner or intermediate knitter, and really encourages you to pick up and knit! I just wish the connections were a little more snug. :)",Great all-in-one circular set for a beginner.,1452643200,3,

I also like the small holes you can dip your brushes in.

I keep the water right up to the opening where you clean the brush in, and it gives a good cleaning, and then I put it in the other for a clean rinse.

This means my brush is always freshly clean and my paints won't get contaminated from the previous color.

The idea for this is really good, but I think it could use some tweaking in design.

If it were watertight, in order to travel with it worry free, that would be fabulous, and worth five stars..

But even still, it is a very handy thing to have in your art accessory collection.

I wanted something to secure the knots and somehow I came across this product.  I am happy with my purchase thus far (especially since I just don't remember what I used to use...).

One concern I had was how to keep the adhesive on the knot and not get it on the beads on either side, but this has such a small applicator (like a wire or fine needle) that it is easy to dispense a very small amount of glue in a very precise area.  I let this dry for a few days, never paid attention to how long (but I like to err on the side of caution).  It seems clear and flexible after drying, but it is holding knots my stretchy cord pretty well.

This is best for non-porous surfaces, according to the package.  My elastic cord is non porous, at least on the macroscopic level that I can see.  I am also keeping this around for jewelry repair (e.g., putting rhinestones that fall out of costume jewelry back in their settings), though I have not had occasion to try that use yet.  However, the precise applicator tip would definitely be useful in such a situation.

This package has a lot of safety warnings about using it in a well-ventilated area and such.  I am not too worried about that because of the extremely small amounts I am using at a time, but if you are gluing in large numbers of rhinestones, cabochons, etc., you may need to pay more attention to the warnings.

This is NOT superglue (no cyanoacrylate).  It is supposedly flammable and must travel via ground, so it may not arrive in two days.  But, one tube is fairly large considering the amount of product you use at once, so it will last a long time.",love the fine tip applicator and that this dries with some flexibility remaining,1469923200,16,

Using a paint brush, I brushed the fluffy white snow onto the roof of the Christmas house I was making and it turned it into a magical holiday home...just the kind of Christmas home you can't help wanting to go inside and see what's happening!

NOTE: To make my snow look fluffier, I just used the paint brush to fluff it up with. Letting it just barely dry a little before fluffing with the paint brush will also help it stay fluffed better.

UPDATED:

What I like best:
 Easy to use
 Makes fun icicles by just putting a blob where you want it and using a toothpick simple drag the snow down. See my photo for an example.
 Weather resistant. Although I have only used it for indoor projects, the possibilities are limitless for outdoor uses.
 It is about the texture of creamy cake frosting. It spreads smooth and not clumpyI wonder if anyone has used frosting tips to make cool designs with.
 Wide mouth jar is great for easy access to the fluffy stuff.
 Non-yellowing
 Non-toxic
 Flexible when dry  I especially like this because my tiny icicles will not get brittle and break off.

I have used several different types of  Aleenes products and I am very impressed with their high quality and high standard of goods. I would recommend this to anyone who wants the look of snow on their craft projects. I'm excited to discover what else I can use this for.

(Besides the fact that I'm painfully impatient in most crafting areas. I. Want. Results. Now.) I found my bottle of Diamond Glaze and went to it...but was disappointed in the results. Goopy. Bloppy. Bubbles way down at the bottom. Slightly yellow. Just not cool. I knew the bottle had been around awhile - but I had only used it once, putting it back on my shelf because I wasn't thrilled with the less-than-perfectly-hard results I obtained the first time. I suppose I should add that to my issues with my second use, too.

I ordered a new bottle and must admit I'm pretty happy with the results. This bottle is much clearer. I still had a few bubbles I had to fish out - and no, I didn't shake it before use. In fact, I've found it helpful to keep all items like this upside down in a coffee mug. That way they are ready to go - no shaking, no rolling, and no ""pffft"" noises. (Maybe I've raised too many boys??) Storing it this way reduces the chance of bubbles by keeping excess air out - and the product seems to stay well-constituted. Anyway...although I was much happier with this bottle, it also never seemed to get totally hard. It got much harder than Gel Du Soliel - but not as hard as resin. If you have experience with similar products, I would say this is better than Gel Du Soliel and Fluxe - ranking below liquid varathane (due to the final hardness). Very similar to 3D Crystal Lacquer. (Rereading that last sentence makes it very apparent I have an illness when it comes to art supplies because yes, I have all that I've listed. And aren't they all basically the same thing??)

Bottom line: I will buy this again. I will use this again. I still prefer actual resin...but Diamond Glaze is a rockin' alternative when you don't have the supplies, time, or energy for resin.

I put my name on Canson paperits fantastic paper.

FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SHOPPING BUT DONT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE PAPER

I don't know about paper for pastels, charcoal (its not my best medium), watercolor, etc., but I do know about graphite or colored pencils for portrait drawing. So, this review is greatly geared towards paper for the purpose of drawing in pencil.

POUNDSLBS

Notice how the pad reads something like 65lbs or 100lbssomething like that? Obviously, the drawing pad isn't going to weigh 65 pounds. This refers to the stock. 60lbs is what I consider Sketch paper, and its usually the pound of paper youll get for a book called a Sketch book. But I draw traditional realistic portraits, and 60lb doesnt hold up against all of the wear-and-tear the paper will undergo for my 12 hours of drawing on it. My minimum requirement for finished pieces is 80lb. 80lb is great. Its not too thick, but not thin enough that its going to crinkle from a misplace stroke. 100lb is also very nice paper, and Id suggest that as well.
If you are buying paper that is meant to be PRACTICE PAPER, you don't need to get thick paper. If copying paper is fine for your purposes, Id suggest about 60lb paper. For more finished pieces, get 80lb. With thicker paper, however, you tend to get less per pad (about 24 sheets compared to 100 sheets for something like 60lb), but SPEND THE MONEY if you want quality paper that is going to still be presentable at the completion of the artwork.

SKETCH vs. DRAWING

As briefly mentioned above, Sketch paper is traditionally thin-stock paper. Drawing paper is more fancy, so its usually thicker and sturdier. Sketch paper is for practice, and Drawing is for the real-deal stuff, in my opinion. Sketch paper is cheaper per sheet than drawing paper (usually), but it comes down to quality. For starting artists, I suggest one of each pad (both drawing and sketch) of about 12 inches tall, that way they have enough room to explore their talents in the Sketch pad, and then exhibit them on a grander platform in the Drawing pad. For the Drawing paper, 80lbs at minimum! Thats the lowest paper I ever use for my portraits. For the Sketch paper well. Thats up to you. I use 60lb, which is just fine, practically like copying paper, I suppose.

The thing about me and VA is this: I LOVED THE BOOKS. Oh, Ive been going through New-VA-Book Withdrawal since the last one came out. Then I decided to purchase for myself a birthday present, and I bought the 1st and 2nd Graphic Novels for the Vampire Academy. The illustrations are fantastic and expressive, and the story is beautifully adapted. I love how Christian and Adrian (in the 2nd book) are drawn, especially. EXACTLY and PERFECTLY how I figured theyd look. These are a wonderful addition to your bookshelf, especially if you're a VA fan in withdrawal.

BIG PAD vs. LITTER PAD

Ah, the question! What size of paper to buy! Thats completely up to you, and what sort of drawing you're looking to get into. I have paper pads that are as small as 6x8, and as large as 24x18. The kind of paper you get is utterly your preference. Honestly. If you want to do large-scale portraits, a big pad is definitely for you. If you want portraits that are about the size of a copying sheet of paper (ABOUT), then 9x12 is great to buy (I use that size most frequently). My only suggestion to you is to get a pad with spiral binding. That makes it so you don't have to worry about pending pages or destroying glued-in or sewed-in bindings. I like the spirals so that I can flip through with ease, and never have to worry about wrecking a previous portrait just to draw a new one.

GRIT/TEXTURE/GRAIN

Some paper has oh pot holes in it. I draw on smooth paper, medium texture/smooth, with my graphite pencils. THE TYPE OF TEXTURE YOU GET IS IMPORTANT TO THE MEDIUM YOU USE ON IT. Make sure you read what type of medium the paper was designed for, because the paper IS different and will take your art-implements differently.

PAPER COLOR

Ah. Color. To me, I don't really care, so long as it isn't stark like gray or pink. I have used bleached white paper, and then just the regular paper that doesnt even specify color on it. I guess its really just up to you and what you're drawing for and with.

OTHER THINGS YOU OUGHT TO PURCHASE

Of course, the type of drawing you do is going to affect what tools you need. However, if you're into realistic portraits of people, etc., I might have a few suggestions:

- A set of blending stumpsor as many as you can get! I use these more often than my pencil in a drawing!
- White charcoal pencil. ESSENTIAL for making things completely, stark white, like highlights. Some people also use white pens, but my preference is the charcoal.
- If you're not a black-charcoal kind of person like me, but still need an alternative to get really black color, I HIGHLY recommend the Generals Layout Extra Black No. 555 pencil. It has to be my favorite pencil!
- PLENTY of different sized erasers. I have big pink ones, pencil erasers, kneaded erasers, and tiny mechanical erasers to get into small spaces easily.
- And, of course, some pencils! I really don't have too much of a preference as to what pencil I usea regular old one you find in a school classroom works! But, if you want to get fancy, you CAN definitely buy some nice Prismacolor or Derwent pencils (both are fantastic, EXPENSIVE pencils). I suggest a Medium or Soft set of 12, if you can. The hard sets can be sort of non-necessity, and you might find yourself only needing a few of those, particularly in the 2H-4H range. 9H is EXTREMELY hard. The guide to pencils is this: 9H-H are hard pencils, and 9B-B are soft pencils. I guess the standard #2 (which is an HB) is the neutral ground.

BRANDS I RECOMMEND

Canson is GREAT paper. Fantastic. Scratchmore is also FANTASTIC paper. I own pads in both Canson and Scratchmore. In Scratchmore, I tend to buy the ones that have a brown cover with the womans portrait on the front. Good paper. Canson, I like the Recycled Drawing 80lb, but thats sort of hard to find as it turns out, so any other Canson paper works brilliantly as well.

Generals pencils are nice and cheap, and they tend to work just fine for me. A MUST have itemis the Generals Layout Extra Black No. 555.

White charcoal pencils. Mine are just Generals brand.

Collection of blending stumps and some sandpaper to re-point their tips as they start to flatten out. Also, you can use this type of leather (I do not know the name, but it comes in some shading sets and is a goldeny color when new). I happened across this neat tool recently when I bought a set of blending stumps and I LOVE it. You can also use tissues, Ive heard, as well as your finger.
ERASERS! Buy a ton of them. Little ones, big ones, etc. Im not too much of a fan of kneaded erasers myself, but go for it if you please!

GOOD sharpener. I have one that sharpens three kinds of tools, and its by Faber-Castell (its called the Blackberry Grip Trio Sharpener).

It's nice to have all those needles sizes in one place. When you want to make something, you don't have to search for the right size and they do include the tiny sizes that other sets do not. I have read here that the sizes aren't printed on the needles. Most metal circular needles don't have the sizes printed on them. All you need is a little plastic or metal needle gauge that costs a couple of dollars and keep it in your case with the needles..no problem. Another problem I read was that the needles unscrew while you are knitting. There is in the case several little gadgets that will help screw the needles tightly so that doesn't happen too often. I haven't had that problem with mine. Ok, now for the things I don't like about these needles. I don't like the way the needles connect to the cable because they are not as smooth as they could be and the yarn sort of grabs on. The cables are horrible, they are too stiff and they are not long enough. The customer service from Simplicity (where you can get replacement parts) is terrible. You won't get any help from them. If you do need help, your best bet is on line tutorials and knitting chat rooms.  I found a tutorial on line to make longer more flexible cable for these needles and I am going to try that.

 I think I've filled up 3 of these by now. I wanted to add that I have been using this journal for Copic markers (Sketch). Of course there is bleedthrough--but honestly they go through almost everything.  I use the recommended Memento Tuxedo Black to stamp my images, and Pigma Microns to draw my images or make doodes with the intent to color. The Copic markers don't feather across the page too much, you just have to practice coloring as close to the line as possible without going over it, and that is true with a lot of papers. Although the paper in this journal isn't perfect paper for Copics, I do like art-ing (yes, it is now a verb, you're welcome) on the paper in this journal as it is smooth and feels really nice blending.

I always love adding stuff to the covers as I go through the journal. Right now, I have an Apple (Mac) decal on the front cover, so I affectionately call it my ""Mac Book"".

EDITED ON JUNE 16TH 2015

I repurchased this journal because I wanted to see if the quality had changed since March of 2014. It has significantly. This journal (which I had purchased from Amazon both times) can finally used and holds up to the same expected quality of the large journal. Both the large and small journals take Dylusions paint beautifully, and can even handle using spray inks on top of the paint. In fact, I (re) purchased this last month and it's almost full already. Thank you Ranger! Now on to the cover. The cover that they'e using isn't as smooth as the older journals, they definitely have a texture to them. This journal and the last 5""x8"" both of the elastic bands broke on me in the same spot. I don't think it's me, because the larger journals don't have a problem with that. What I decided to do was paint the elastic black, then took the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elastic-Loops-by-Tim-Holtz-Idea-ology-6-5-Inches-Pack-of-10-Loops-Black-TH93141/dp/B00IXWMCYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elastic Loops by Tim Holtz Idea-ology, 6.5 Inches, Pack of 10 Loops, Black, TH93141</a>&nbsp;hitched to the old elastic so I have the elastic problem fixed.

ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM March 5, 2014
I concur with others about being disappointed.

I'm a big fan of the original Dylusions Creative Journal (large) so I decided to get this one too. Most of the time I like to work in smaller notebooks.

I find there is significant bleed through, so I can't  use the backs of the pages I do. So if I do a 2 page spread, the backs of both sides are unusable. If you so use ink sprays, or even plain water, it will be ruining your work on the other side. It's so wasteful.

What I've been doing is using other paper (Bristol smooth 300 series) to do my things on then using washi tape (like if you were to insert pages back into the journal; a technique that Dyan Reaveley does) to insert in between the spread that has work done on either side so there's an extra page there even if it's not the same paper as the journal.

You can use a little distress paint on the backs of the journal paper that has the bleed through from the other side.

I own a lot of the Dylusions rubber stamps, and the images can take up a lot of space on a page(s) because they are on the larger side.",Because I loved the bigger journal (updated review on the quality--from two stars to five),1393977600,20,

The charge for each skein of DMC floss is only 44 cents, regardless of color. However, the shipping charges added would have about tripled my cost for the DMC Floss. Unlike many others, I have no option to purchase embroidery floss, nor many other craft items in my local stores.  Such things are either not carried at all, or the selection is very poor.

Neutral:
This floss, while not up to DMC standards is also not up to DMC pricing. At the price I paid for this item, my cost breaks down to about 12 cents per skein.  Sometimes, you do get what you pay for. The skeins are about 8 meters long, similar the DMC skeins. I was expecting more colors with no duplications, however, in my package, most colors included are represented by two or even three skeins. The included 12 cardboard bobbins are about enough to hold one project's worth of thread.

Cons:
In examining some DMC floss that I purchased for a different project, I discovered that the six strands you obtain when this floss separates are finer than the DMC floss strands... finer enough that you may want to use three strands of this if the instructions for your project call for two strands of DMC. Another reviewer mentioned that the quality of these skeins makes them unsuitable for mixing this floss and DMC in the same project. I agree; however, I would never, under any circumstances, mix two different brands of floss in the same project.  As noted by other reviewers, these colors are neither named nor numbered, which makes selection of your exact colors a bit difficult if you try to go by DMC numbers or color names.  You can find colors in dark, medium and light shades of colors somewhere near those listed in DMC project instructions, so all is not lost if you attempt to use this floss.

Pros:
While this floss isn't quite as shiny as DMC, it is not, as another reviewer claimed, completely dull. It does have a subtle sheen of it's own. It is also not, as a different reviewer said, all in one thick strand. It will separate into six strands as the label claims, and does so without much difficulty. That said, this is a decent alternative for small projects, provided that you only use this floss for the entire project. If you are doing craft projects other than embroidery, such as friendship bracelets, this is a decent alternative for those other uses, at about 1/3 the cost of DMC floss.

Recommended for friendship bracelets and other children's crafts, for those just learning embroidery, or, if in desperate need of a small amount of a few colors for a single (small) embroidery project to the extent that shipping would cost more than your thread if purchased from Hershnerr's",DMC it is Definitely NOT!,1359417600,67,

When water is sprayed in, the water sat in the middle and softened the middle.  After only one use, a hole developed in the center of the cake, which is hallow below.  So, the next use I now have a hole and when I spritz with water to activate the paint, the water just settled in the bottom of this hole, making the cake barely wet to use.  It was okay the first use....and the shimmer is nice (it's not like this huge twinkling sparkle, just a light shimmer when looked at, at an angle).  I guess I'm just disappointed.  This has happened with two of the jars I used from this set.  The jar is tiny (1 1/2"" diameter about) and with the huge gaps / hallow areas, it isn't a lot of cake, even though it appears that way at first glance.  And, this is true (the gaps/holes/hallow areas) for several jars (if you look at the sides of the jar you can see it too).  This isn't just a single 'bad jar'....this is just how they are.

It's number one job is to save your fingers from being scorched by your iron.

Don't want to heat up the iron to quickly flatten seams on an economy block? Use this like a rolling pin, and you'll have the rest of the corners sewn on in less time than it takes to heat the iron.

Having trouble holding that butterfly seam open to iron and thinking about just pressing it to the side instead even though your seam will be too bulky? Iron Finger to the rescue!

Step by Step
CHOOSING FABRICS. Rit works best on many natural, washable fabrics and materials, such as: a. 100% cotton, linen, silk, wool, ramie
b. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon
c. Fiber blends with at least 60% cotton or other dyeable fiber (blends will tint evenly but will not achieve full color)
d. Nylon-based plastic such as those found in buttons, fasteners and lacrosse sticks
e. Natural materials such as wood, wicker, paper, feathers and cork But there are fabrics and materials that will not accept dye, such as: a. 100% polyester, acrylic, acetate, fiberglass, spandex and metallic fibers
b. Fabrics with rubber backing (bath mats or throw rugs)
c. Fabrics with special finishes such as water repellents
d. Fabrics with bleach damage or extensive staining
e. Fabrics washable only in cold water or labeled dry clean only
f. Polyethylene plastics such as golf discs
g. Polycarbonate plastics such as eyeglass frames
Fiber content and weight also effect how color appears making fabrics like cotton, wool and silk absorb dye differently, slightly changing the hue and brightness of the chosen color. If you are in doubt as to whether your fabric will accept dye or achieve the color you want, we recommend testing a swatch.
DYE PREP. Cover work area with a plastic table cover or newspaper and have paper towels or sponges handy to protect against any possible spills.
Wear rubber gloves to protect hands from getting stained and to insulate them when working with hot water.
Use plastic buckets or stainless steel pots for the dye bath. You can also dye in a stainless steel sink. Dont dye or rinse items in a porcelain or fiberglass sink or tub as they are likely to get stained./p>
ACHIEVING TRUE COLOR. Always follow manufacturers care instructions for your fabric as well as Rit Dye package or bottle instructions.
Remove stains on fabric or use Rit Color Remover before dyeing to get fabric to an off-white or cream color. This will help achieve uniform color results when dyeing.
Dissolve powder dye thoroughly in 2 cups of very hot water first to avoid dye spotting. Stir dissolved powder dye or well-shaken liquid dye into dye bath until evenly dispersed. Never pour liquid or powder dye directly on fabric unless looking to achieve a specific creative effect.
Be sure to use enough dye for the weight or size of the project. For example, for a pound of dry fabric (about 3 yards), use one package of Rit powder or 1/2 bottle of Rit liquid in 3 gallons of water. You want enough water for the fabric to move freely in the dye bath so that it can absorb the dye evenly across the garment.
When dyeing 1 pound of dry fabric in dark or bright colors such as Black, Dark Brown, Cocoa Brown, Navy, Purple, Wine, and Dark Green, use double the amount of dye (2 packages of Rit powder or 1 bottle of Rit liquid) in 3 gallons of water.
For the deepest color, use a water temperature of 140F/60C and keep heat constant while dyeing (the stove top method or a washing machine work best). Note: If tap water is not hot enough, heat water on the stove, in a teakettle or in the microwave.
If dyeing a garment more than one color, its usually best to start with the lightest color and move to the darkest.
For more intense color when dyeing fabrics containing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup salt to the dye bath. When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup white vinegar to the dye bath. If possible delay adding the salt or vinegar until 5 minutes after the fabric has been in the dye bath. The delay will help to promote level dyeing.
Add 1 tablespoon laundry detergent to all dye baths to help promote level dyeing.
The longer the garment is immersed in the dye bath, the deeper the resulting color. Items can remain in the dye bath up to 1 hour as long as the water remains hot. Youll also have to make sure the item receives constant agitation or stirring.
Garments will also look darker when wet and prior to washing.
When you remove clothes from dye bath, rinse in warm, then cool water until water runs clear. (Warm water helps to rinse off surface dye more effectively.)
Wash your fabric/clothes in warm water with mild detergent and then rinse thoroughly in cool water. Machine dry or hang dry.
CARING FOR DYED ITEMS. For the first two or three times, wash your dyed item by itself in cool water with a small amount of non-bleaching detergent. Always wash your dyed clothing with similar colors in cool water with mild detergent. Dry cleaning silks and special fabrics is recommended.
CLEANUP. Clean containers and sinks immediately after dyeing by scrubbing with hot water and powdered cleanser or bleach.
Clean washing machine using highest water level with hot water, detergent and 1 cup chlorine bleach using complete wash cycle. Clean lint traps. Plastic or rubber machine parts may be tinted but will not stain laundry.",Great Buy!,1464220800,19,

I just grabbed a couple of stamps at random and quickly used a few stamps. I think my technique will improve with practice.
When I see the price for just one stamp pad at the big craft stores, I'm amazed that it's possible to buy every colour of the rainbow, plus some, at this very reasonable price. AND you get a bunch of adorable stamps with a block thrown in!
The idea is to peel your choice of stamp, or stamps, off the sheet and stick them onto the clear block. They self-stick, so you can easily arrange them how you like. Then, holding the block, press onto the ink pad and stamp the image onto your paper. Done!
The stamp pads themselves are a good size and the ones I used had plenty of ink in them to easily get the image onto the stamp. There are three sheets of assorted stamps, plus a gift stamp which is extremely pretty.
The stamps are arranged on a thick, clear sheet of plastic with another sheet over the top. It's very simple to put the stamp back in the correct place once it's finished with, as the outline of the stamp is printed on the plastic sheet. A nice touch, I thought.
I was lucky enough to buy this set at a reduced rate for testing and feedback.

But, if one is looking for 12 gauge wire, the expectation would be that it is very, strong and requires a good deal of muscle and annealing for any serious wire wrapping techniques. So it's great wire- just be sure of the softness you're looking for as this bends into and out- of shape with virtually no effort. As jewelry it's too soft- just normal wear is likely to result in your piece being bent out of shape.

So I purchased it and I don't regret it at all! The colors are so vibrant, and extremely pigmented which is what I really wanted. The colors aren't granulated, nor is there glue residue or separation of paint and glue when severely stretched with water. All the colors are gorgeous.

This is the first kit that I have come across that has any color thread that could be needed! There is a total of 32 mini spools as well as 32 bobbins. The mini spools have a great amount of thread in them, I was really surprised! What I thoifjt it was is those little cardboard rolls that are included in  most other kits,  however this is much larger than I expected! All of your basic colors are included as well as some neonish colors as well multiple color variations of the same color. Its really nice to have all these colors in one pack! If you can't tell in impressed!

I love that this EBeauty Sewing kit doeant throw in all kinds of unnecessary items just to fill space. What you need is what you get. What you get is quality here! The wheel that includes the needles is not made of cheap plastic that cracks when the fastener tape is pulled off and the scissors actually cut!! You get 30 different needled with different sized heads. You get 2 plastic thimbles as well as 2 threaders and a measuring tape that measures up to 25 inches on one side and 64 centimeters on the other. This tape is of quality as well, this is not one of those tapes that has the little threads coming out all over just waitimg to unravel . its a good tape! This all takes this kit to a whoping 100 pieces!! Each piece sits nicely into a plastic tray. The tray sits nicely into my sewing box and keeps all items in their places!

All in all this is an excellent option of a mini sewing kit! This would be great for a beginner as well as for making a travel kit or even to have the options that yjis kit offers for your daily needs as they arise, this kit would get the job done!

There are velcro straps to hold the machine in place inside the tote.  There is a small flat pocket on the front (good for thin items like paper, small ruler, scissors, etc.).  It doesn't stretch open very far, so nothing too big would fit.  That's the only storage on this tote (the black version).  At first I thought it had tons of zippered pockets on the inside, but those are just the openings where they inserted the cardboard sides.  So the tote is cardboard sandwiched between fabric (at least for the sides).  There is another color available, and it shows more pockets under the flap than this version.

The handle extends, but does not lock in place, so you can only pull one direction.  For example, my carry-on suitcase has handle that locks, so I can pull or push in any direction.  With this tote, if you try to go another direction or push instead of pull, the handles will not stay extended.  It's a bit inconvenient.  The handle is also still a bit short for me, so I can't really walk properly when I'm pulling it behind me.

It gets the job done, but if I could go back, I definitely would have bought a different tote.  One with more pockets so I don't have to carry another bag containing my supplies.  Or perhaps one with a strap to carry instead of one with wheels.

After all, I had been managing so-so just by measuring a quarter inch from each side and drawing a line, marking a larger dot where the seam lines intersect.  It worked, but is time consuming. I will also mention that I was previously using a chalk pencil, so my accuracy wasn't the greatest - and provided the prompt to break down and buy this.  I had seen Jinny Beyer using it in her Craftsy class, but I was resisting the urge to buy yet another gadget.  After having to tear apart a block for the 4th time due to inset seams not matching, I pulled the plug.
With this device, I simply lay it on the appropriate angle and mark the dot, very quickly and accurately. The dots along the edge let you also mark the quarter inch line at intervals to help keep a straight line when hand stitching.
The holes are very small, so you would need a mechanical pencil....I opted for another tool, the Sewline chalk mechanical pencils.  The small holes force us to use a smaller marking tool, but it also improves accuracy.  My inset seams now go together beautifully.

There is another benefit to this tool.  At one point, I thought it was my stitching or marking that was the problem - it was actually that I cut my diamonds wrong.  A little slip with the ruler when cutting is easy to miss, but this tool makes it very easy to lay on the patch and check its angles. The most common 5 or 6 angles used in quilting are on the tool.  There is also a dotted line along the edge that you can use to check your scant quarter inch.

42369,1,True,"10 26, 2016",A2EZQMU5XC39CK,B000WUTIU6,,shoremama,"I loved this bag. However I have two small issues. One, I wish the top had a zipper so that if I use this while traveling I would not have to worry about anything flying out of it since it can't fold very flat with things in it. Second, one of the best things that I liked and made me order this bag is that it can stand freely. While the outside pockets have nice vinyl plastic,the bottom of the bag is canvas. I often knit and crochet on the beach, or decks/balconies or docks so I need something waterproof around damp sand or wood. To try and solve the issue I bought a sheet of craft foam, then measured and cut the piece to fit the bottom of the bag when open. I have yet to try it, but hopefully that works. If not, then this bag will not travel with me and stay at home.
Update a few months later: I loved this bag so much that I ordered another. The first one was the natural color. I used it on vacation, it was so handy during a few days of use on the beach and in our hotel room that I decided to use that at home and bought a black one to use only travel,because it should stay cleaner. A few days ago at home the first bag completely broke. The metal screws in the rods that crisscross under the bag and on the sides, not only popped out on both sides, but BROKE right out of the holes. Bag would not stand up freely anymore, was unfixable and had to be tossed You can't still use the bag if the metal rods are flopping around because there is no way to get the bag off of the metal unless you cut it off. Now I am using the second bag at home, I don't trust it for vacations and expect this one to break sooner or later. I did not overstuff the bag. It was not even folded much. It did not get wet on the beach. After one use during traveling it was mostly on the floor all day by my knitting chair, sometimes I would pick it up and fold it to move it but not often. The metal is cheap and ruins an otherwise nice bag. Cannot recommend this bag now.",Broke after a few months.,1477440000,12,

They are vibrant and pleasing on the page, and blend quite easily on application or while being worked in the piece.  They also layer very nicely as well.

I have also used them with a water brush in the field, pulling the color from the pencils and applying it to the paper with the water brush.  It's been a fun experience thinking of new ways to use them and trying out different techniques.  I have had no problems or issues with the pencils breaking, and the colors feel very smooth.

When I tried to cut, the blade looked perfect, but it hopped and skipped all over the fabric and nicked my ruler.

While I think the paper inside is very good, the journal itself isn't very well made.  I read some reviews where people had loose sheets that just fell out of the journal and I was a bit concerned with that.  I think Pentalic has been reading the reviews because they just went overboard with the glue here.  The one I received had so much glue that I had to tear some of the pages apart to get them to lie flat. (basically the front/back pages of each signature had this issue).  When I tried to get the front page to lie flat a bit while I was sketching a test drawing the front sheet completely tore off.  I like the paper enough that I just fixed it with some painters tape for the time being but I don't know if I like the paper enough to deal with so much excess glue or chance getting a journal with loose pages again.
As to the paper, it was really nice to paint on, the paper absorbed water like a champ without warping.  Wet on wet watercoloring was really nice and I had to brush on the water a few times since it was absorbing it so fast.  The paint also dried super fast.
Besides the glue issue the only thing I really disliked about the journal with the pen loop, something I could definitely live without but I do see how some people would like it.

I can happily say it works great.  I love being able to put a nice embossed letter (or the bee, shell or flower) anywhere I want it on a card.
To use it, simply choose your letter plate, which has two parts; positive and negative, position it in the Folder where you want it, position your card or paper and then create your Sizzix 'sandwich'-- a cutting pad, the Folder/letterplate/card, top with another cutting pad and roll it through the Sizzix.  Voila, embossed monogram!
Sometimes the cardstock crinkles around the letter a little, but I've found that it flattens out easily with a little rubbing.  You could also use a couple of the foam pieces that come with a Movers and Shapers die to keep the crinkle from happening in the first place I would imagine.
If you own a Sizzix and were wondering if this would work with it...wonder no longer.  Just be sure to purchase the All in One 6 by 9 inch folder as well.",Classy Embossed Monograms with my BigShot,1381104000,3,

The bottles are small (about 1/2 oz. each), but a little paint seems to go pretty far. Love the honeycomb effect of these paints. Some reviewers say that these paints have a strong odor.  I am very sensitive to chemical odors/perfumes and such, but these paints didn't bother me.  There is a slight odor, but not as strong as spray paint.  I used them indoors and haven't had a problem. What little smell there is disappeared once the paint dried.

The price is somewhat expensive in my opinion, but considering the paints are a product of France and have to be imported into the US, I guess the expense is justified. I have discovered that larger bottles of these paints can cost as much as $10.00 for a 1.5 oz, bottle, so this Discovery kit allowed me to try each color before purchasing a product that I would ultimately not like.

To definitely get more out of this, get a colorless blender for some nice fading. If you want to shade with markers, you will have to before hand know where you wanna put your shadows, then use your blender. Not really related to the markers but it's just something in general for all markers. Only markers that don't need such things are Copic markers which are A TON of money.

It didn't roll with the suggested sandwich, so I removed the shim.  It went through, but didn't cut fully.  Hopefully they may come out with one later that will have more power and roll more evenly, because that was an issue too.  It didn't cut evenly.  I also folded cardstock in half and used a thin die to try and make a card, and it didn't push through enough to cut through both layers.

There were complaints about mounting hardware not being included even though the seller doesn't state it's provided, just advertises the rack as wall mountable.  My rack also did not come with mounting hardware, I don't really mind since I plan to use it standing.  I was also concerned that 550Y size embroidery spools might not fit well since there were many complaints about the spacing being too tight and the pegs too small.  550Y spools fit perfectly with plenty of room for convenient use.  I ordered a 63 spool embroidery thread set and it arrived along with the rack.  I filled the rack with 60 of the 550Y spools and it remained sturdy and stable, not tumble prone as others have experienced.  The wood is stapled together, but mine was neatly put together, undamaged and exactly as described.  Not giving the product 5 stars because it's not a high end product, though it does the job and is worth the price.  Delivered on time, product matched the image online and was exactly as described.  It sounds like the production of these racks are hit or miss.  Thankfully, mine was a hit.  Would purchase again and would recommend it to others.","BETTER THAN I EXPECTED, A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE!",1481328000,5,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81HBw-Z8KBL._SY88.jpg']

It's a bit hard since the make of the body is very light which is a good and a bad thing. It falls over VERY easily! This was obnoxious at times.

The dials are a little fussy and you can't have one dial at one measurement in the chest and have the hip measured to certain options on the dial. It forces it back to where it wants to be instead of where you need it to be. This is fixable, only if you pad up the body form for your personal shape.

I also couldn't get the adjustment in the chest correct because the busts size was already enlarged enough to where if I made the body form for my rib cages size, the bust was way too large...

The thread also catches on the bottom of the spool, which leads to the thread breaking if you aren't watching and don't catch it.

It started to stitch at the top of the C. After the 1st thread breakage the loops of the C were too loose, so I had to adjust my thread tension up from 2.8 to 3.2 and that helped some. If you notice at one point only the bobbin thread was stitched, because the top thread was caught on the bottom of the spool. It didnt't break, but I had to watch the thread unwind and give it a little bump when it caught.

I will have to stitch the design again with different brand thread to see if it would work. I wanted to love this thread, but it didn't work out for me. Thankfully, this is my test towel and not my real project.

This is definitely in the former category.  Patons Kroy FX was a desperation purchase at a local craft store when I was on an extended stay in the midwest.  I hadn't bought enough yarn to last through my visit, and the chain craft store came through with a modest selection of sock yarns.  I chose the Cadet color, which is shades of blue and gray strands twisted together, which produce socks that look like distressed blue jeans, with darker bands of indigo and lighter bands of grayish-blue.

Boy, did I enjoy knitting this yarn.  It's a four-ply yarn, soft and heavier than a fingering weight... I'd say it's almost a DK weight.  I knit the socks up on a size 2 needle and gosh, did they ever come out nice:  a nice springy fabric that had a thick, sturdy-feeling hand.  The socks seem very hard wearing, too.

I purchased this at a local chain craft store for as little as $4/ball but heck, I might be induced to pay full price as it's a really nice yarn, and has even made my personal ""top ten"" list of sock yarns I love to knit.",A nice surprise!,1354665600,27,

I've only had one basic sewing class at a chain fabric store and it was with a non-computerized machine 8 years ago. I've been sewing ever since as a hobby on an average of once a week, so I've picked up a lot on my own. Thankfully, I have another less-fancy computerized machine, or I probably would have packed this back up in it's box when I opened it. With that being said, if you've never used a computerized machine, don't walk away, just read the instructions and follow them carefully. Everything you need to know is right in the book and you can go to Singer's website, if you have further questions. As far as the quality of this machine, it is built so well. It isn't like most of the machines today. It is heavy and feels to be made of metal, like they used to be before everything was made of plastic. I was really surprised by the quality. I feel like this machine will be the last one I ever have. Now for the performance, after reading the quick start guide, I was able to wind a bobbin and thread the machine with ease. Picking the pattern proved to be a little more challenging for me, but after reading the instructions carefully step by step, I was able to figure it out. After figuring that out, I was home free. It sews like a dream through anything I've tried to sew. I've even sewed patches onto a leather motorcycle jacket, with ease. I did it very slowly because I didn't want to ruin my machine, but none the less, it did it. I must say that the knee lifter is my favorite feature. I had never used one before, but I always have to shorten mine and my sons pants and usually it's a chore, but with the knee lifter, I can easily lift the presser foot to move whatever I'm altering around. I've only quilted a little, so I find that I use this machine more for my altering, but plan on quilting more often in the near future. If you do quilt, I really recommend this machine. It makes it so much easier to maneuver the large quilt with both hands when you can lift the presser foot with your knee. That combined with the extension table makes this machine just amazing. So, if you quilt or alter many things, this is a great machine.",It isn't like most of the machines today,1407974400,10,

However, I tried to apply a delicate die cut of vines to a textured fabric (a faux-leather) and it did not work at all. Running it through the die cutter, with parchment over it as the instructions said, resulted in the backing coming off the adhesive. When I finally did get the backing to stay on one (after three attempts, wasting tons of the product...) and adhered it to a test scrap of fabric (with my iron set to medium heat, the design covered in parchment, for thirty seconds, just like the directions say), when I pulled the backing off the adhesive came up with it in some of the thinner, more delicate areas. I tried to reheat those areas to get it back down, but it just wouldn't stick, resulting in a broken image. Very glad I thought to test this first, otherwise my fabric would have been ruined!

I think the problem was the texture of the faux-leather. I could not see anywhere it specified not to use on textured fabric (and in fact the Amazon description says specifically that it's great for porous surfaces). I'm very displeased with this, as I don't do gold/silver leafing very often and can't imagine needing this for anything else.

I know most of the time I haven't a problem sewing a nice clean straight edge, and probably you don't either, however, we're all human. After a while, we all enter that ... mind numbing, kids are yelling at each other, husband comes home, phone rings, fabric is thicker than the elastic band around the edge trick .... and BAM suddenly you're trying to debate whether or not it's THATTTTT noticeable ... do you really want to break out the seam ripper or will anyone notice the big curvy edge you now have or will your serger jam up if you try to hem over the mess you just made so you don't have to seam rip the mistake .... maybe you can just make a new panel ?! etc etc ... Since I got this little seam guide --- all that has been avoided for me!!

The only downside I had at first but have learned to avoid with a little adjustment to my machine stitches, was if I wanted to use a hem that called for the guide to be about an 1-1/4 out. The magnet seems to repel right about there and won't settle as strongly. However, I've learned to just adjust my machine (whatever stitch I'm using to the left a quarter inch or so), and everything is fine.

The magnet is strong, it has a curve on the guide so the fabric whether thin or thick guides easily by and has never gotten tangled or caught, and even when I want to use it right up against my presser foot it never hinders my serger a single bit. I love this little magnetic guide!!","This little magnetic guide is a hidden gem!! I wish I had discovered it sooner! Strong magnet, great tool!",1444953600,,

There are 3 fixed rows inside this bin, then the dividers can break up those rows and be placed throughout (or not used at all).

The only down side I can really state is that if you over-stuff the compartments at all, it bows out the fixed dividers, making the removable dividers not as functional as they'll pop out on one side or leave gaps. I didn't really over-stuff, I just tried to put something in that was millimeters larger than the size of the row. So I guess it would be nice if the fixed dividers were movable - or at least one of them removable. Despite this, I still think they are great containers and I also have the variety that does not have any dividers whatsoever to accommodate larger items.

My main issue, however, and the reason for the low rating is because of the absolutely RIDICULOUS price for different designs here on Amazon. As a general rule, unless you're talking about trademarked characters (think superheroes, Hello Kitty etc), a roll of duct tape costs about $4 in a regular store. Yet, go on Amazon and you find them ranging from $6-9, which is absolutely preposterous. I live in a small town so I can't get all the different designs in local stores but, honestly, who wants to shell out that much money for duct tape??

I liked the color selection.  It was quite versatile and didn't have colors that were too close to each other; but, close enough to blend nicely.  The color flows smoothly and there is no streaking.  I used them to color a mandala & found the fine point tip worked perfectly for intricate areas.  While the ink does bleed through paper, I found that if I used the point tip lightly in tight spaces the color didn't run over the line into another part of the mandala.  Some of the colors don't exactly match the color of the cap.  But, that is not unusual  at all.  I always make a color chart so I know exactly what color I want to use.  I simply number the markers using a black Sharpie, write the number in my chart, & color with the marker.  It's quick & avoids mistakes.  I think it would be helpful if the markers were numbered by the manufacturer.  The reason I deducted one star is because three of the markers are rather dry.  I really don't think they will last all that long.  I tried moistening the tip; but, that only caused the color to be diluted.  It was worth a shot though.  Other than that, I really like these markers and will probably buy more in the future.  I'm hoping the dry markers are just a fluke as I don't see other reviewers complaining about it.  For the price, this is a great set of markers whether you use them for coloring or calligraphy.","Nice set of markers.  Three were on the dry side; but, still a great buy.",1512604800,,

It saddens me because I still want to make crafts and create my own decor. I'm limited when it comes to places like Michael's because they stock a little bit of everything and that means I'm usually finding 1/2 of what I need, and then trying to hunt for the rest on-line. Joanne's is wonderful but I have one store near me that is small and limited in stock, or I'm stuck paying shipping because they play the coupon game via their on-line site. Talk about craft stores making me not want to do crafts! I have purchased at Aaron's Brothers frames but when it comes to canvas and paints, I better catch them on one of their 3-Day deal sales or pay too much.

In comes US Art Supply, a company that puts a stop to the coupon game and has their prices reasonable 365 days a year. It's literally a super store and if you paint, cut glass, air brush, play with fabric or even pottery.....they stock it! It's there for you to shop 24/7 and they are with it when it comes to availability because they have an Amazon store too. They have survived the times by staying ahead and carrying their own home brands and also the popular ones we have been depending on for years. I spent over an hour just browsing US Art Supply's website and it just perked my creativity and I realized I wanted to again create. Making crafts and art relaxes me and changes my environment. A new picture on a wall changes what you see and I was brought up that if you want something made right, you most times have to do it yourself. I have the want and now I have Us Art Supply fulfilling my artsy needs!

I was sent a pack of their 3 x 4 canvases. The pack contains 12 ready to paint stretched canvases that are primed.  The canvases are triple primed using an acid free acrylic gesso.

Retail Price Point: $14.96 and if you have Amazon Prime, it's eligible for free shipping!

I have a hallway that was itching for a picture because the walls were bare. I have always had a love with frames, doorways, walls and just anything architecture and the sort. I could print up pictures from around the world of doors but I wanted something more my own, so I made my own mini doors. I purchased a shadowbox frame for $15 and the rest was made at home. I also used Us Art Supply's acrylic paints and I absolutely love them. They are vibrant and dry the same way with shine and intensity. I made 6 doors and incorporated wood, nails, metal to even copper wire to create a more dimensional piece, plus different materials incorporated tend to make a nice blended look that creates a nice flow to the piece. The canvases are a dream to work with. The primer stays on and helps the pigment in the paints pop. No grainy finish and no matter how much I painted, aged with a patina, water washes, and I even used oil paints, the primer never peeled or wrinkled. Smooth and a perfect canvas to create on that never gave me any problems no matter how much I tended to change my mind while I created. I love that kind of freedom because my ideas can only become reality if the materials I use allow them to. The price is more than fair and I compared. For the quality, the quantity of canvases, you just can't go wrong with Us Art Supply! I can also order at 2 AM and Amazon has spooked us by delivering that evening or the following day in the morning. Yup, less than 24 hours from ordering and I'm making art happen. You just can't get that anywhere else!

Ice Resin is much easier to mix, it is still a 1:1 ratio, but once Ice Resin has been mixed for 3 minutes, that's it. You can wait 5 minutes for the bubbles to de-gas that may have been created while you were mixing. Whereas with Easy Cast, you mix for one minute, pour into another container and mix for another minute, just one extra step I can truly live without. (And creating more waste than I want.)

Also with Ice Resin, even though it is a 1:1 ratio mix, it is forgiving and will still cure even if your mix is off. Just a bit and not a lot is what I am suggesting.

Finishing results there is a difference. They both set up the same, cure in the same time frame, but when it comes the look and clarity, big difference, well to me anyway. Easy Cast has a slight yellow tint to it, Ice Resin is crystal clear like looking through glass. And I will try to get a photo up showing the differences I have noticed.

I'm working on a handmade keepsake box, and I ran out of the double sided tape I'd been using.  Comparing this to the tape I had been using:  1) This tape is easy to tear with my bare hands, making it easy to use; the tape I had been using had a vinyl-type liner, which means I had to pick up my scissors every time I used it.  When making crafts, I often need both of my hands to hold the object, so using scissors is very awkward. I really like being able to tear the tape with my hands.  2) This holds just as well as the more expensive tape I had been using.  A good, solid hold is important.  3) It is true to size.  I once bought some double-sided tape that wasn't as wide as I thought it was.  That particular tape did not have the width listed on it; that should have been a red flag.  The liner appeared to be 1/2 inch long, so I assumed the tape was 1/2 wide; it wasn't.  It was only about 1/4 inch wide.  I was duped, but I learned my lesson: never buy double-sided tape if the dimensions are not clearly marked on the package.  This tape says 1/2 inch & it IS 1/2 inch.  4) This double-sided tape is a great bargain.  Compared to other tapes I've used, this is longer & less expensive.  If you divide the price by the length of the tape, you will be able to compare the price per yard (or per foot or inch)  I won't do the comparison for you because prices vary & what you pay may be slightly different than what I paid.  Just remember to compare the length in the same measurement.  Some tapes list how many yards, feet or inches long they are, which makes it difficult to compare the price per unit.  This product is 42 YARDS long.  Other products I've seen are 27 yards long or so many inches long.  If you don't have a calculator handy, this product is 126 feet long or  1,512 inches long.

And, they are really not that easy to use.  You don't get a fine line.  They don't all flow evenly and fluidly.  Depending upon the fabric, I'm sure, its difficult to get it tight enough (tea towels - cotton) and it moves around, so you can end with fat lines and then thin lines.  So, no consistency in workability of the pens themselves.  You are not supposed to ""squeeze"" the tube when using it, which is nearly impossible.  And then you have to sometime push down so hard on the tip to get them to work that it's nearly impossible to only squeeze ""gently.""  A couple out of the box worked fairly well and I caught a quickly but fleeting glimpse of how fun these pens could be.  But, the rest worked just awful to be honest.  In addition, if you have any hand pain or arthritis issues, this is not a craft for you.

I did try to place the stamps side by side the second time, but the letters were spaced too far apart and I had to smooth the clay before doing each letter individually.

I am a kitemaker, and do some detailed stitching on applique projects.  The 21 leds light up things so I can really see what I am doing.

One problem I found with the light is the magnetic base.  My machine is largely cast iron, and the magnet does not work.  My solution was to cut a 2 finch square of tin, and use double sided tape to stick the tin on the back side of my machine.  Now the light curlls around and really puts things into light!
I have another machine that I use quite a lot, and I may just buy another so I do not need to keep switching this light back and forth.  Then again, I may just give it to a firend that does the same kind of hobby work that I do.  Gotta get all the ""nice guy"" points when, and how, I can!

Unlike some brush pens whose ink comes out grudgingly, these are loaded with moist color. They're easy to blend on a piece of plastic or just painting from one brush onto the other. I just got them yesterday so I can't say how long they'll stay that way, but they're a joy to work with.

I got them because I'm learning brush lettering. I find a smaller, stiffer brush-type pen (e.g., Tombow Fude or Pentel Touch Brush) to be easier to handle, but when I get it right the bigger, more flexible brushes have a beautiful look. So I'm practicing with both, using the free exercises and videos at piecescalligraphy.com/learn as a guide.

In making my decision, I picked up several individual pens from a local art store: Tombow Dual, Sakura Koi, Prisma Brush Tip, and Sakura Pigma Brush. I've attached a sample comparing the lightest to heaviest strokes of the Zig Kuretake with the others. The other sample is just some exercises I did with the Zig and a couple of others. As you can see, the results are similar. The Tombow is perhaps a little less flexible and more consistent than the Zig. The Prisma brush is a bit smaller than the others. I found the Pigma to be the toughest to use, which is why it ended up getting short shrift at the bottom of the page. ;)

The best starter set is the 12 set, if you buy that with the book The Art of Brusho by Carrie McKenzie, you'll be amazed at what you can do with the 12 set of colors.  This set has a lot of earth tones so it makes a great addition to the 12 set, where you get cool and warm tones of all the primary colors, a few secondary colors plus brown and black. The price for this set on Amazon is pretty high, I could have found it for less elsewhere so I took away 1 star.  You are paying a price premium here for the convenience of getting it in 2 days. (I ordered a larger set and even though it said in stock, their inventory sold out, but my account kept saying it was on the way...........so thats another issue, paying the extra price premium and not even getting it in two days, I cancelled that order!) Keep in mind the lids don't have holes on top so you need an awl to poke into the lid so you can shake out the color or use a small fan brush if you don't want to poke the lid, just be careful of cross contamination as you dip your brush from one color to the next.",Beautiful earth tone colors in this set,1519948800,,

I was given a set of 12 by my fiancee and I wore them down on so many photos that I dreamed of this set. The purples are so amazing. These are quality and it doesn't take much to sharpen them but for me it takes awhile to get them to the point to need to sharpen them. I own a couple of Poloychomros from purchasing in stores and these in my opinion are better by far for less of a cost. They are creamy and just so wonderful and blend-able and work great if you want to use Vaseline with them, the colors are rich and dark when you want them to be. I am so happy with these pencils!!!!

I had no problem sharpening them with my Kum or Alvin/Dux hand sharpener. The wood did not split or break. The colors are beautiful and there is little color shift from wet to dry. The pigment dissolves easily and works best on smooth or hot pressed paper. It does not require you to scrub the paper to activate the watercolor paint. You may see a little pigment dust when laying down color, its best to blow it off the paper into a dish or the trash than swipe with your hand and smear it. Most pencils do this and it isn't a bad thing, it just is part of the personality of your art tool. If used on cold pressed paper with more tooth/texture be careful not to press into the paper with the pencil or the lines will not completely dissolve, which is great if that is the look you going for but not if you want a smooth color flow. According to Derwent most of these pencils have great lightfast ratings, but this is not noted on the pencils or the tin. There is no literature provided with the set, you have to look it up on their web sight or read the one posted here in Amazon. This is probably a personal preference, but I love that the name of the color is clearly printed on the pencils and they are in numeric order, also printed on the pencils, from 1 through 72. For me it makes it easy to do a color chart and then keep them in order for quick color selection. The pencil color paint d on the tip is pretty accurate. Overall this is a great value choice in the category of artist quality watercolor pencils. The color range, quality, and price, make them a comfortable buy and fun to use because you don't have to feel wasteful if you want to doodle with them. While they are not budget or cheap pencils, the price currently being charged is in my opinion a fair price for an artist grade tool.",Extra happy with these pencils!,1497916800,2,
