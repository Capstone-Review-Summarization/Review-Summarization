      "I absolutely love this company! I am a person with multiple food allergies. This product just uses black beans and water. Gluten free anyone?  Texture: Has a more even texture compared to Tolerant Black Bean Noodles. It is a more \"meaty\" al dente pasta which does not break down easily when boiled. I followed the instructions on cooking to 7-8mins which came out perfect. The pasta did not break down when re heated on the stove. Just a little drop of oil and stir to heat up again. It also did not stick together like glass noodles.  Fullness: Please use the serving size recommended. In my joy I ate 2 servings when I should have stuck with one. Not a good idea as I was beyond full. This pasta has monster amounts protein which help fill you up. I even use it on my no meat day to sub meat. I think the bag makes 4 servings so it is a good amount of pasta in your plate for a serving.  Taste: It does not taste like beans beans (the one we all know and love when mom makes it). It has a mild flavor, not quite earthy, but it does enhance the ingredients you place in the pasta. I made my meat sauce and placed it with glass noodles and this one. Glass noodles just completely distracted the dish as it had no flavor of its own. The black bean pasta just gave the dish a more ..... savory? .... not quite sure what's the word. It just made it taste better.  Would I buy and recommend it: Heck to the yes!  Even recommend the mung bean pasta this company makes if you want a strong meaty texture (great for vegans).\t\n",

      "So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it won't happen to you?  It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.  That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.  Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.\t\n",

      "This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System  Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall.  We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.  I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!  I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!  Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.  The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.  Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.  - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!  - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.  - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.  - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.  - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.  NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.  - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.  - OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!\t\n",

      "Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.  So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.  1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.\t\n",

      "Update: Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch has just purchased National Geographic.  Do not trust the content from here forward.  He is planning to turn the magazine and society into a for profit organization in order to hide science and progress under the guise of a 'scientific journal'.  E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!  For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.  I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.  National Geographic has taken its place as top world history/sociology magazine again.  The stories may be less fleshed out than some other magazines.  These guys are definitely about the pictures.  But the pictures usually serve a purpose. They aren't just glossy and pretty.  Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.  The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.  I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.\t\n",

      "My wife ordered this to help get the kids (and mom and dad) off the couch during the winter months.  We've done the video together as a family and there are definitely some positives.  I would guess the video will appeal most to kids from toddler ages through 7 or 8.  Older than that and they may or may not find it a little too \"babyish\" as my 9 year old son would say (though he did the video with mom, dad, and 5 year old sister and seemed to enjoy it despite the obligatory complaints about it being babyish, so even older kids might like it).  The routines definitely gets you moving and is challenging enough to get your pulse going but not so hard that most kids or adults will be unable to handle it.  This isn't hardcore, it's not P90X, but the challenge level seems just right for a broad audience of kids & parents - kudos to the makers for getting that part right!  The music is pleasant, not great but very much suitable to the content and nicely varied (we particularly like the Celtic dance number).  The instructor makes the most of things, keeping a nice chipper & fun demeanor without condescending to the point of alienating dads like me.  All in all what you get for the workout routine is very well done.  I am knocking one star off, however, because of the limited amount of actual  workout content.  This DVD screams for another 1 or 2 workout circuits in order to provide some variety.  It wasn't clear on the product description page, but the video runs about 42 minutes - BUT the workout portion is only 25 minutes, with the remaining 17 minutes being promos, nutrition tips, etc.  So what you get is ONE really nice 25 minute workout circuit.  I would easily give this 5 stars if it had another one or two 25 minutes circuits to provide some variety.  Otherwise a great resource for families looking to promote fitness and spend some fun time exercising together.\t\n",

      "If you follow Quicken, you may recalled my review of Quicken Deluxe 2008. My main complaint was that the date field would revert to the current date whenever I temporarily left the entry to do something else. Frequently I ended up with several incorrect dates and had to go back and fix them.  Also I should mention that I only use the check registry and no other features.  This annoyance has been mostly corrected. You can go to Find, for example, and then return to the entry and the entered date will still be there.  If you wander too far, the date may revert, but the main problem has been resolved.  So far as I am concerned, this would be the main reason to upgrade from the 2008 version.  I did not find the new features useful.  I cannot make the \"flag\" feature do anything, so I gave up on it.  Now I would like to make OCCASIONAL use of the Tag and Notes features, but to do that, I would have to make them  available.  The problem is that this would add two extra keystrokes when entering a check as the Amount column is at the end.  Quicken claims that you can arrange the register's columns anyway you like, but I found I could not move the Amount column to be next to the Category field so as to avoid the extra keystrokes.  You would think that fields that are not used for every entry would be placed after the Amount field which has to be filled in for every entry.  Of course one could theoretically hide Tag and Notes and call them up only when needed, but surely the information on them ought to be visible all the time so that one does not overlook it. In any event, it is much easier to stick a notation into the Memo field rather than call up two other fields from time to time.  In all fairness, I think the Attachment feature might be useful but I have not yet have had occasion to try it. In conclusion, if you do not yet have a program for keeping track of your checks or finances, I would strongly recommend Quicken Deluxe 2011.  Over the many years I have used Quicken, it has undoubtedly saved me hundreds of dollars in duplicate contributions or extended subscriptions, and thousands of hours of time. But if you already have a version of Quicken that works on your computer, and which you like, you may not need to upgrade.\t\n",

      "I really like the Weber Q series of grills and now that I am on my second one, a Q200 (my Q100 was stolen) I decided to get a cart for my new, larger grill.  Weber makes two carts for it, the 6507 Rolling Cart and this item, the 6508 Stationary Cart.  The reason one is called \"stationary\" and the other \"rolling\" is because the 6507 folds up and includes a strap so that one can use it as a caddy for transport.  Since it folds you can put it in the trunk of your car.  If the folding feature is not important to you, they both function the same as far as moving them around when the 6507 is fully upright.  The 6508 Stationary Cart includes a hose adapter for the 20 lb. LP tank and the other does not.  It also seems better built and includes a screen that blocks the tank from view.  The cart was fairly easy to assemble, even though I hate to put things together.  It took me about 30 minutes and I only used one or two bad words.  I would have spent more money for a cart that had more metal and less plastic, but it is what it is.  It still seems well built and sturdy enough.  When you fold out the shelves on the 200 or 220 this portable BBQ pit transforms into a really nice, small, full featured gas grill.  I find it easy to move around I think that this is a good compromise for someone who wants both a portable grill and standard-type one.  <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Weber-6507-Rolling-Cart/dp/B000WXFHJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Weber 6507 Rolling Cart</a>\t\n",

      "Got this to replace my 4-year-old Visioneer scanner. My visioneer scanner works with my paperport verion 9.0, but it won't work with the latest Paperport version 11.0. So, I have to find a new one. This LiDE90 is a good balance choice between price and performance. Got it from Amazon for $69.99.  Pro:  1. Powered by USB directly. So, I now don't need to power it up/down between scanning jobs any more.  2. Very thin. And is smaller than my visioneer scanner.  3. Work with the latest Paperport software (ver 11).  4. The scanner driver provides quite some options. Good for fine tuning.  5. Scanning speed is good (depends on resolution).  Con:  1. The lid can be raised about 1 inch for book scanning. But, can not scan think books.   Some people may complain about the squeezing noise from it. But it's not too loud. And it seems all low-price scanners have similar type of noise when scanning.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase.\t\n",

      "My Springer spaniel ADORES this toy. It's like a security blanket to her. She usually rips off most of the tennis-ball fuzz, leaving a goofy-looking rubber football. But she LOVES this thing. We've designated it as an \"outdoor-only\" toy (because she has too many toys), and it's the first thing she grabs when she walks out the door. It's more important to her than actually going to the bathroom. She gets very sad when she can't find the toy (when she's played with the kids, or drops it to go after a rabbit, and then can't find it when she comes back). She lost one over the winter in the snow, and we (she) didn't find it until spring. She was ecstatic. She brings it to the back door and knows to drop it before she comes inside, though sometimes she tries to sneak it in.  We've been through a few of these over the years, buying a new one when an old one gets lost, or when it finally bites the dust. (We foster animals, and an especially gregarious pit bull puppy helped shred one to bits - but they had a blast playing with all the smaller pieces. If they hadn't played tug-of-war, I don't think the whole ball would have come apart.)  For all those who are bummed about the fuzzy stuff...that's life. The dogs love to \"skin\" what they eat or play with. The ball underneath is still perfectly fine for playing with, if a bit slobbery by the time she brings it back to you to throw again.  As happy as this thing makes my dog, I'll never stop buying them.\t\n",

      "I skipped a couple of years because of the bugs in the last version I tried (2012). I hated 2012 so much I stopped using it in 3 months and uninstalled it.  2015 still has GUI issues throughout the entire application. I am a software developer, so these things stand out really bad. It is a shame they cannot fix any of them in 3 years.  The worst though is I am still seeing the same problem with synchronizing my main bank account.  It routinely skips transactions and never downloads them.  If it was only one transaction here or there, that would be easy to find and add manually.  However it always skips more than that. This past week it skipped an entire day and also all deposits for the week before.  Just the deposits for that week.  Finding what is missing when it is that many is cumbersome at best. The only way to easily fix it is to delete the account and add it back.  That always downloads those missing transactions so that means it is not a bank problem. This is not a solution though because then categorizations would need redone each time.  Anyway, three years later and many of the same old problems plague version 2015. They really need to hire some management that would at least pretend to know something about software development.\t\n",

      "I purchased this for use as my main BOB (Bug out bag), I currently have a couple other backpacks of similar price and this one just blows the others out of the water. The material quality feels sturdy and the stitching seems extremely well done, I did a pretty thorough search on the pack and did not see any loose or fraying ends. The MOLLE works exactly as you would expect and I can't think of anything else to add on it except that there is a great amount(Both front pockets, both sides, shoulder strap and bottom. The shoulder straps them self are extremely comfortable with thick padding. The hip belt is thinner though without padding (About the same thickness as the MOLLE webbing although a wider overall strap).  The hydration pouch padding is comfortable and thick enough to protect the bladder(which as mentioned in a previous review is large enough for a 3L bladder), this pocket which is about 15 inches by 11 inches was also large enough to hold my laptop (15 inch screen) and the charger fit well in the top pocket.  Both pockets in front are about 2 inches deep, the top one (About 8 inches by 5) doesn't have any divider pockets while the bottom pocket (roughly 8 inches by 9 1/2)has a smaller admin pocket in it big enough to hold a cd case or note pad (I currently have a shirt pocket size Rite in the Rain Notebook in there w/ room to spare). In front of that admin slot there are multiple smaller pockets the left most one perfect for a nice size multitool and the others for a sharpie, pens or pencils)  The second compartment in front of the Main compartment is a bit deeper than the front pockets and about 16 inches by 9 inches and the zipper for this pocket run about half way down the bag. This pocket also has a small admin pocket similar to the one I described in the last pocket however on the outside of it rather than having the pen/multitool size pockets it has 2 mesh pockets (each one is exactly have the width of the pocket they are on top of and run the entire length of that pocket).  The main pocket is roughly 4 and a half inches deep and 19 inches by 12. This compartment can unzip all the way to the bottom of the pack so you can really organize well in here. One side has a zipper pocket that goes almost all the way across and the other has a Mesh pocket that goes all the way across.  The bottom also has some nice compression straps to hold sleep system or tent. There are also 4 other compression straps on the pack bringing the total to 6 so you can really get your gear strapped tight for minimal movement.  The estimated delivery time was nearly a month and a half from the date I ordered it since it is shipping from out of the country however I received it in 8 days and it was I received an email that it had shipped the same day I ordered it. There are a few things that I would of changed although they are more me nitpicking than complaints, the first being the zippers, they are paracord instead of an actual zipper which I would prefer however they seem extremely sturdy still and actually are a little easier to operate then a smaller metal zipper. Another thing is that the bottom of the pack is the same material as the rest rather than a more water resistant material (the inside is PVC coated so shouldn't be an issue). and lastly I would of liked some sort of padding on the hip belt but again the current one is serviceable and the pack is comfortable and light. Overall this is a beautifully put together pack that rivals or beats many packs of a much higher price. I am sorry for the extremely long write up but I wanted to include the information that I wanted to know before I purchased. If you are on the fence, I say go for it. I love it and plan on buying another for my fiance.\t\n",

      "I almost passed on these because of the low ratings people have given them. I took a chance on them anyway because I figured the fun effect they could have out weighed the chance that they were as bad as the reviews said they were. The fact is, these are pretty cool. I have played with them for about 1 hour total now and they work great and are holding up to quite a beating. Far more than I thought they would. They light up bright and look pretty awesome.  Having said that, there are a few things these are not. First as mentioned in other reviews they do not have the same feel as a wood stick. I see no reason to lower their rating for that though because after all, they are not wood sticks! Wood sticks are pretty rigid where these have some flex to them. They're not rubbery just not rigid like wood. This is likely so that they are durable. Unlike wood, plastic has no grain structure. If these were made more rigid they would likely be brittle and break easily. These are likely a compromise between rigidity and durability. Overall I'd say the effect is very livable and they are very playable.  Also, these will likely not be as durable as a good wooden stick. These again are not wood and plastic after all. The thing is, wood sticks don't last forever and even break during use. These also will not be every day sticks and possibly not even all night sticks. They will be sticks where the added effect of a brightly lighted stick is worth the loss of feel and possibly durability.  If you're thinking about these for an added effect for a show or a little novelty when your playing, I say go for it. They do appear to be able to hold up pretty well to hard use and for limited uses they can be pretty cool. Just don't expect that you will throw away your wood sticks, that's not the point of these.

      "I can't believe I spent $18 on this remaster. This is supposed to be A SPECIAL EDITION CD REMASTER, but the fidelity is so horrible. It sounds like they attempted to make a \"modern,\" \"extra-loud\" version but they obliterated all the magic and soul of the original recordings. I am frankly disgusted.  \"A Walk Across the Rooftops\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. As to Wikipedia appropriately puts it, this album \"was noted for its use of empty space and detailed separation of each musical instrument, designed to showcase the Linn hi-fi equipment to best effect.\" Whoever was pulling the strings on this remaster had no concept of this. They crushed it (compressed it) likely in order to make it come through Spotify, iTunes, laptop speakers and earbuds immediately \"louder.\" They also totally hyped Paul's vocals to the point at which they are so abrasive and distracting that I could not even finish listening to the album.  Congratulations mastering engineer (or record label), you followed convention and trend and gave no consideration to the fact that the target audience of this remaster MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT DYNAMICS. If anyone from the label is reading this, my gosh, PLEASE PLEASE remaster this. I am die-hard Blue Nile fan, but I am not even going to pay 18 dollars for a bunch of hyped/crushed bonus tracks. I will stick to the beautiful jazz/classical-esque dynamics of the original masters. I remember the first time I heard this album. It was an dream-like, ethereal listening experience unlike any I'd ever had before. I remember falling asleep to this album on numerous train rides throughout Europe. Everything I fell in love with is gone on this new remaster, and no I am not a purist. It is truly that bad. Anyone with a copy of the old masters and a decent set of headphones or stereo will agree with me.\t\n",

You do need another kind of switch to fully use the vlans offered by this unit. I did figure out this trunking is not the cisco type of trunking. If you want the cisco type, it is called \"tagged\" in the vlan config. This trunking is more like link aggregation. This is a nice feature to have! On a final note, this model has been discontinued. The new HP hotness is the 1810G-8.  My only complaints are. This switch does not support STP, or spanning tree protocol. They have updated the firmware the pass the traffic to prevent a packet storm. Also the IP you use to manage this switch does not support IPv6. This should be really easy to add. I just want it to have a set IPv6 address.  Wonderful unit.\t\n",

      "I've been using this model of instrument mount on my sax for close to twenty years, if not longer.  It has a lot going for it.  It is adequately flexible.  It holds the mic element securely in the included windscreen.  The clip is strong and will not mar the surface of whatever you clip it to (like a sax bell).  It fits the Audio Technica ATM 35 or AT 35 Pro series of microphones.  It also comes included with the Samson Airline wind instrument mic, which is what I use now.  I love the microphone, so this is the mount for the job.  The only issue I have with the Unimount, is that it does wear out with use.  Over time, the stress points will weaken, loosen, and eventually break.  Now to be fair, I am a full-time musician and play in rock bands.  I am not easy on equipment...so it's only natural that stuff wears out, eventually.  If I had to guess, I'd say I get about five years of frequent use out of one mount.  I'm not sure if that's \"good\" or \"bad\"...but fortunately, they are still available and easy to replace.  More casual (or careful) musicians might get many more years out of one Unimount.\t\n",

I have a small 48 x 32 inch desk in my room so I can handle 3 AM phone calls without going to the office and schoolwork.  Desk space is a premium.  With a monitor stand I have a fixed configuration which means its a pain in my lower back to move anything or reach past the monitor.  With the ARM in place I can just push it out of the way without touching anything else.  It sounds small, but it is huge.  Now I can get up close for engineering drawings and push the monitor back for college multimedia presentations. I have space for a book, notepad, phone, or whatever I need to get the job done.  I would recommend this for any person with limited space.  The ARM is big and beefy.  I find that I have more adjustment than I need, but you have to position it correctly.  I tried the back of the desk first, but found the ARM (any ARM) will be a maximum of about 17 inches and a minimum of 12.  Placing it centered on the left side I can pull it 17 inches forward or push 17 inches back which is the full depth of my desk. Also, I can fold it out of the way flat along the left side.  In all cases it takes ZERO desk space.  You may need to tighten the bolts on ANY ARM you buy.  Moving parts move.  I have to remove a trim cap to tighten one bolt so keep the wrench that comes with the ARM.  They trim caps just pop off with a screw driver.\t\n",

      "Wow amazing works just like in the videos.  First time out I called deer during the pre-rut here in SC.  So realistic!  Very easy and love the monostat slider.  Only issue I have with it.  Just after 2 months of using it.  I went to blow it one day and it took more pressure than normal.  Kept blowing and it came out muffled and extra vibration off the reed that made it sound off and not realistic.  I loved it so much that I reordered another one...  I was not in the window of returning the first one so there's that.  If you are questioning yourself about buying one?  Just buy it.  You will not be disappointed with it.  The quality is there.  Built from tough thick plastic.  I've called in a couple deer with it and yup they were all shooters and some 2.5yrold bucks but it works without a doubt i'll be trying their black rack system next year.\t\n",

      "I purchased a new laptop and it came with Vista and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security 2007.  Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.  The good:  - The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.  - The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.  - The controls are easy to manage and tweak.  The bad:  - After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.  - 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.  I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.  This should reduce the probability of problems and needing to interact with Symantec itself.\t\n",

      "OK, now I am very impressed with this particular brand's quality.  I have a few other items from Obagi.  They are pricey, yet so worth the money in my opinion.  I applied some drops of this vitamin C professional serum on my fingers to smooth on my face, neck, and chest.  This liquid smells wonderful; the texture is slick.  So slick that I need to watch getting it all over the bottle, ok?  The foil-covered bottle top has a cap which gets replaced by a dropper cap.  I see a visible difference in the appearance of my skin.  Wow.  I am so self-conscious about those deep lines I am getting above my lips as well.  I felt this product going on like silk, leaving me moist and perhaps a tad primed for the moisturizer, perhaps after cleansing, or followed up by some other treatments perhaps.  It is to be used day and night.  Obagi Professional-C Serum 20%, 1 fl. oz.  It is an antioxidant formula for all skin types.  I am not sure what the fragrance is.  This is very concentrated.  Also, this comes with an information booklet.  It covers different formulas from this company, and what they are for.  It has instructions.  Nothing complicated about this to worry about.  My skin agrees with it.  I am very inclined to purchase this product after I am finished with the bottle. I recommend it wholeheartedly.  I really didn't have a clue that anything could be done about my fine lines.\t\n",

      "The plot of this short film revolves around the young George Lucas in his senior year of film school. He's trying to write a great agricultural space epic, but can't seem to put anything together until he meets a beautiful girl with big hair in the student theatre. She encourages him to write what he knows and from there it's movie history. The DVD version of this short film includes a short commentary by the film's creators, an enhanced version of the film (basically a pop-up video trivia veiwing), a short \"making of\" documentary, chapter search, and a \"special\" secret feature (the code number is 1138). For being a short film, a lot of these features seem redundant. However, they fit in with the spirit of the film and make the DVD that much more entertaining. Also included on the DVD are three other shorts. EVIL HILL is a parody of the Austin Powers films and the movie NOTTING HILL. A young Mr. Evil (he's not a doctor yet) is treated like a monster by the people in his small town in Bavaria. However, one day Marilyn Monroe wanders into his children's book store and his life is changed forever. FILM CLUB is a parody of the movie FIGHT CLUB. If you haven't seen the movie, this short parody will make no sense whatsoever. The final short is SWING BLADE, a parody of SLING BLADE and SWINGERS. That short is filmed as a coming attraction and shows what would happen if Karl from SLING BLADE moves to L.A. and hooks up with the gang from SWINGERS. Overall, a highly entertaining DVD that fans of STAR WARS and/or film buffs will enjoy.\t\n",

I used the stock software that came with the GT-1 and had no problem getting the hardware (cable & radio) detected using Windows 7.0 Professional 64-Bit. However, I was not able to get the hardware to detect using Windows 8.1 Professional 64-Bit version. I was also unable to get the software to load AT ALL on Windows 7.0 using XP compatibility mode, so I will assume that this hardware does not work with Windows XP, either. Oddly, the software does mention supporting Windows VISTA. Go figure.  Unlike some reviewers here, I had no problem getting the connector to \"fit\" with the radio. Everything seemed to fit snugly. The USB end of the cable is a tad large though, so I wouldn't plan on plugging any other USB devices right next to it. I'm not quite sure why the USB end of the connector is so large. It seems like a poor design.  Much like it's radios, this Baofeng/Pofung patch cable is rather cheap. It does exactly what it is supposed to do though and for $7 (approx current price) you really don't have much to lose. It isn't something that you will likely use on a regular basis, so wear and tear on the cable should be minimal. Baofeng has always been know for their incredibly cheap two-way radios. If you already have one, getting this cable is a no-brainer. William Van Hefner, KB6VWL\t\n",

      "I love this so very much!!! Extremely easy to put together. I enjoyed the smell of the wood. I bought this for my cat. I placed a thick pad on the bottom to keep him comfortable. Would love to get the one with a balcony!!! Just gotta wait until I can splurge again. Color is as shown. My pictures show a few of the building process images along with my 15 pound cat inside. You can adjust the bottom screws to make this level on uneven surfaces. Huge plus!!!! Already tested with many rainy days/nights---no leaks!

      "My 1 year old male cat has a lot of toys he enjoys. But I've learned to periodically hide them and rotate which ones are out because he bores of each pretty quickly. But NOT this Cat Dancer toy. Such a simple thing and yet Nova goes bonkers for it. It's nearly the only toy I use to play with him anymore and he often will drag it around the house with one end, catch the other end moving, and leap after it, in essence learning to play with it himself.  Many people comment their wonder at how such a cheap, simple toy could be so miraculously enticing to cats. I think it's because if you bounce it right, with the wire, it moves like a butterfly or bug, and you can even increase this effect by erratically bobbing it. Nova goes crazy when I do this and it's definitely the most entertaining toy others like to watch us play with. Even beats the laser pointer, which he loves too.  I can't recommend this little product highly enough. I've already bought two more so I have them at the ready as he's nearly chewed through most of the cardboard on the first one I bought him. He is a chewer, but even still the first one lasted about 2 months of constant play and use and chewing. For the price, that's fine by me!  Also, because of the way this thing bounces, I can dangle and move it around while working at the computer (I work from home and so Nova seems to assume that means I should be playing with him the entire day) and keep him entertained. When I try this with other toys I have to take my attention off what I'm doing to see what the toy is doing and get it to move in a way that entices him.  This toy, while you do have to hold it or affix it to something else that can hold it up - it's still the easiest and most consistently played with toy I've ever seen for a cat. We all love it!\t\n",

      "This was a very good story. It was an interesting tale about a cutting edge experiment and 3 doctors that take part, while indulging in some BDSM as well.  Rachel's a doctor that is getting ready to move for a new job when her old lover that she hasn't seen in 5 years shows up on her doorstep (Colin). He offers her a job with him and Julian, a doctor she's always wanted to work with and has always had the hots for. She knows it'll be tough working with both Julian and Colin but she decides to take the job. What she doesn't realize is that part of the job involves being a submissive to Julian and Colin.  Julian and Colin have been involved for years and have both wanted Rachel for years. When they bring her on the team they see this as an opportunity to finally bring her in to their relationship. As the work progresses so does the relationship between the 3 and Rachel finds herself falling for both men (she still had some leftover feelings from before and they just get build on as things progress).  Unfortunately there are some issues that come up in the professional side of their lives that causes Rachel to feel she's been screwed over and she leaves Colin and Julian. Eventually they do end up coming back together and forgiveness is given.  Overall I did really like the story. It was interesting and I liked the trio, Rachel, Colin and Julian. It's worth a read. :D\t\n",

      "I have been a fan since Welcome.  Then I backtracked to Gift, which by the way, is a great album.  \"Smile\" and \"Again and Again\" are two of the best songs I've ever seen live.  I saw these guys once on the Welcome tour and twice on the Blue Sky Research tour.  I've seen over 50 bands live, ranging from Rage Against the Machine to the Beastie Boys(actually that was the same show and it was killer!!), but my favorite is Taproot.  The energy simply can't be matched and Stephen has the least forced scream I've witnessed in person.  I was a huge fan of Blue Sky Research.  Easily their most diverse record, the tempo shifted from heavy to melodic and back seamlessly throughout the entire album.  That brings us to Our Long Road Home.  Recorded in a remodeled barn near Stephen's home in Michigan, the band created it's first independent album since pre-Gift, giving them the freedom to do whatever they wanted.  Unfortunately on some tracks, it's easy to understand why.  Don't get me wrong, there are some killer cuts here.  Old school fans will still dig the hell out of \"Path Less Taken\" and \"Take It.\"  \"Karmaway\" may be the highlight of the whole album.  With its lazy, soaring guitar riff, it has a very un-Taproot vibe to it, almost epic in a way.  The single \"Wherever I Stand\" is pretty catchy, but not in the same realm as past singles like \"Poem\" or \"Calling.\"  \"Be the 1\" grows on you and \"Stethoscope\" is a beautiful instrumental that seems like it could've been better off as an intro to an actual song.  With the good however, come the bad.  \"Run to\" is the definition of cheesy nu-metal rock, even more so than \"Promise\" from BSR.  The chorus just feels forced and would've been more appropriately sung by Chris Daughtry.  It's just not very good.  \"It's Natural\" features the first time use of female vocals by the band, with lackluster results.  The remaining tracks here are just average.  Our Long Road Home in a nutshell isn't a bad effort from Taproot, just not what I've come to expect from a band that has never ceased to amaze over the years.  I guess it's basically what I expected: some really killer jams, and some effortless pop songs.  While not as balanced as BSR, it's a decent effort and will surely find its niche within both diehard fans as well as new ones.\t\n",

      "I am completely amazed at all of the negative reviews regarding this product.  I'm a recent Mac convert and was devastated if not completely amazed that no company has really created a blow your socks off financial suite for the OS.  I have tried every personal finance software for the Mac that I could find, either via google or the app store.  This included, SEE Finance, MoneyWell, Money Dance, iBank, YNAB to name just a few.  Nothing, and I mean nothing connected to my banks (which have direct download) as smooth as the Quicken for Windows did.  The last straw was one of the programs actually reported your available balance on a credit card in it's summary as your balance owing.  The solution was to make a manual entry initially to \"force\" it to report correctly.  Not gonna happen.  So, out of sheer desperation and being willing to toss away $19 on this download I went for it.  I have to say, what is wrong with you people?  This worked FLAWLESSLY the first time for me.  Every bank was found and every account was downloaded perfectly that I wanted it to.  As a matter of fact, it also grabbed one of my banks that has a loan and it grabbed my insurance bill!  Even the Windows version wouldn't do that.  But as I type this in, I'm staring at my updated and downloaded loan balance.  FANTASTIC!  Another brilliant idea is the section where you can review all transactions downloaded on one screen and not have to move from account to account.  Budgeting seems simple enough and will work for me.  Nothing else I tried even came close to the effectiveness of this \"essentials\" stripped down version.  For $19 this is an absolute steal.  When iBank and others want $59 or even more, forget about it.  I have been with Quicken since the DOS days and then moved on to Money (which I thought was a better product) then back to Quicken on m PC.  I have to say, I'm very, very pleased with this purchase and the fact that I don't have to spend the money on an upgrade for my Windows version that would have easily cost more than $19.\t\n",

      "I purchased two of the mDesign Desk Organizer 7, white -- one for my bedside table and the other for a small glass table in my living room.  I needed something  to organize essential items I need near me that were cluttering my space.  These little white plastic organizers did the trick and I am very happy with them.  The one in the living room holds my calendar, important correspondence I have to deal with, scotch tape, paper clips, lens cleaner and a small Boogie Board that has a magnetic back but since I did not have anything metallic near my chair I could not hang it.  This board is what I write on with its stylus to remind myself of important things I have to do or jot down telephone messages -- when I have taken care of whatever is on the board I push a button at the top and have a clean slate again.  It is great but no use having the board if I can't stand it up where I can see it and I keep it in front of my correspondence.  In the bedroom I have 3 small remotes for the TV -- one in each of the back three back areas.  I put my glasses and some tissues to see me through the night in the largest space and in the front I  place my little remote for the radio, my spray for my asthma, and more lens wipes.  Everything is neat in both places and just think how awful all that stuff would look on my tiny tables without this wonderful little organizer.  I searched for hours on Amazon until I found this and it was so perfect I purchased two and I am so glad I did.  The items were well packed and arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  The wells are not deep enough in this organizer to hold my big remotes for my cable TV and my Samsung TV in the living room but since I have three shorter TV remotes and one very tiny remote for the radio in the bedroom.  There is even room for my Kindle Voyage reader in the wide space where I put my glasses and some tissues in the bedroom -- ensuring that these two breakables will not get knocked off the table and land on my ceramic tile floor as I grope for a tissue in the middle of the night.  If you need a desk or table orgaizer, check out the mDesign Desk Organizers -- I chose the one with 7 compartments but there are others with different configurations that may be just what you are looking for.  I love the clean white plastic material, the openings at each end so you can easily carry the organizer, and the smart, modern look to the plastic that is very sturdy.\t\n",

Had to ship back for refund. Would like to receive correct cover as the quality is excellent. UPDATE 9/16: Received refund as soon as UPS picked up the package. But the vendor still does not understand the problem. When I attempted to place the cover on the grill, it was too small - short in width & depth. Looking @ my current Weber cover ( which has deteriorated) the white tag on inside corner read 7553. So I knew I ordered the correct cover - 7553 / 7107 from King Kong. So I checked the white tag on inside of the Kong cover - it read...7106, which is a smaller cover for a smaller Weber. SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM !... SOMEONE @ THE VENDORS FACILITY PLACED THE WRONG SIZED COVER ( 7106 ) IN THE RIGHT SIZED BOX (7107 )  FINAL UPDATE : Vendor has been extremely courteous & apologetic. He shipped me another 7107 grill cover and... IT FITS PERFECTLY ! Great looking cover, far better than my original Weber cover . Wouldn't hesitate to do business with this vendor in the future.\t\n",

He uses women & then kicks them right out of his bed, but then we see the flip side of the coin that just once he would like a woman to make it a little tougher on him, give him something to chase, but these bimbos are mostly married or engaged & are just looking for a quick romp too. But when Tristan met Leah all those years ago she made him wait, she bantered with him & made him crave her company, not just her body. Once they finally got down to business & had the most fantastic night of their lives, big misunderstandings occurred. In Leah's mind, it sealed Tristan's fate as a permanent douchebag loser. And that is why in book #1 we find his brother Dre, his girlfriend Kathryn, and Leah all teaming up with a terrible plan that totally throws Tristan under the bus. It saves their youngest sister Piper but yet it was totally unfair to Tristan. Dre & Kathryn's wedding day approaches and that is why Tristan & Leah suddenly find themselves in the same city relieving their old misunderstandings. Tristan's father is completely heinous, to all three of his kids, so much so that they've shut him out of their lives. But the one advantage is they decide to finally bond together. Once Tristan gets out from under his father's influence he seems to make a complete change in his life - not really believable but ok. Can't really go from douchebag deluxe to suddenly being a philanthropist helping out all of Dre's friends! There are many interesting side parts to their story, like Leah's mom's battle with cancer & how she may be affected. Luckily it makes her live her life to the fullest & take advantage of this new opportunity with Tristan to start fresh & establish a real relationship with him! And we also learn what happened to Piper as a teenager.

      "First of all, this wheel is packed loose in the box with no protection of any kind, so you are at the mercy of the shipping company.  Fortunately, my package seems to have been well treated and the wheel arrived undamaged.  Upon removing the wheel from the box, I noticed that the rim is made of thicker and heavier metal than the one that came with my bike.  It feels much sturdier than the old one, although only time will tell for sure.  A quick check revealed that the rim was nearly true, so I didn't bother trying to adjust it.  All of the nuts, washers, etc required to attach the wheel to the bike and secure the brake arm are included.  Most of these were in a little pouch, but a few were loose in the box and had to be hunted for.  The ends of the axle had poked holes in the sides of the box, but fortunately someone had the foresight to tape pieces of cardboard over the holes to prevent anything from falling out.  One nut was already on the axle and had become frozen in place.  It took a considerable amount of force to dislodge it, but after that it worked fine.  Also included in the pouch is a rear cog and retaining ring.  Since no instructions were included, I had to look at my old wheel to determine which way the cog went on, but it wasn't that difficult to install.  At first, the wheel made a bit of noise when spinning, so I took apart the coaster hub and found only a light coat of grease inside.  I applied a lot more grease, reassembled the hub, and it was nice and quiet after that.  If you don't know how to service or assemble a coaster hub, this might not be the wheel for you.  I've been riding on the new wheel for a few days now, including a trip of over 20 miles, and it seems to be working well.  In particular, the brake mechanism works much better than the one in the original wheel ever did.  Overall I'm quite happy with my purchase.  It doesn't arrive ready to roll, but if you know what you're doing, it's a good wheel for the money.\t\n",

A weak and feeble light is all that comes out of this joke.  The concept is fine - the execution is lacking. Undermined by the cheap materials and components used. A complete and total waste of money. You'll be a lot happier if you don't buy this piece of garbage. Unfortunately zero-stars is not an option.  p.s. Their \"customer service\", first claimed this wasn't their product (despite the large, prominent company logo on the cover). Secondly, they really, really want you to send this $2 toy back to the company - rather than write an honest review on Amazon.  Yes, they want your defective item so they can \"analyze the failure\" and make corrections to the product, even though they are not the manufacturer.  This item costs $1 on orders of 1000 on AliExpress, individually they're $2. The company's products can usually be found elsewhere for 1/3 to 1/2 of their price.\t\n",

      "I read all the reviews and was not sure this house was going to work out. I read how small and flimsy it was going to be. I have three children 10 months, 2, 4, and 6. I figured one of them would enjoy this house! Turns out it is a perfect house for the baby who will soon be one. She enjoys going in and ringing the door bell. The four year old also loves the house. It is definitely on the small side. My four year old loves it and does fit in the little seats but my 6 year old is already too big for it. It can fit two small kids inside. The table and chairs inside are very small. However, it easily fits in our playroom as well as a bedroom. I debated back and forth as to whether to buy this one or a bigger one. I am happy that I went with this small one. For around $100 it is a good purchase for a little play house for kids 3 and under in my opinion. It is very cute in person as well! Not sure how it would do outside. It seems like a playhouse for indoors or on a deck. If you are looking for a small playhouse I think this one is a hit!\t\n",

Spamming your customers via their financial software that they PAID for is tacky.  Shame on you Intuit.  I have already dumped QuickBooks for one business I operate, and we are looking to dump it for another business.  And yesterday I dumped TurboTax for H&R Block because Intuit stripped some forms out of TurboTax Deluxe to force an upsell.  Now this may be my last Quicken purchase too if a viable alternative presents itself in the next three years.  If you continue to treat your customers as nothing but constant upsell targets you will continue to drive customers away.  I have been a customer for over 20 years.

      "\"Where did you get that?\"; \"What the h___ is that?\"; \"Neat! What does it do?\" Are just some of the comments I get from those who see this little rubber iPhone stand and sound booster. I like the creativeness of this product design. It's a fun, smart design for my fun, smartphone. Now, is it totally practical? Sort of! When I am going to be sitting at my desk, or at home in my lounge chair, for a good period of time it is \"funpractical\"! When I choose to take the time to set it up, it goes this way. Base of iPhone fits into rubber mount and it will stand up. And, oh yes, it will also fall over. You must have patience with it and bend the rubber to get the correct angle each time you set it up. Also, it will stand up with a charge cable plugged in and your iPhone will fit in the stand even if you have your phone in a protective case. The rubber mount stretches! So, on my desk or side table, I have my iPhone (in its case) standing up and charging. When it rings, I answer on speakerphone and the booster directs my caller's voice right at me, instead of all around the room. A speaker phone conservation becomes a bit more private since the sound isn't going everywhere. It's a fun item to battle the dreariness of any work day. For less than your morning coffee, you can add a bit of strangeness to your life. Give it a try.\t\n",

But seriously, what do you expect. Yet for something this size and cost, I was surprised I could plug Line-out to the stereo and it wasn't bad. Just be sure you push your connector all the way in. For the longest time, the connector was not pushed in well, and it sounded crappy. not anymore.  The guitar effects are a bit like the cheesier 80's effects. Don't expect a lot there. But then again, I'm just using this to figure out licks, so that's not a big deal in my case. Most of the time I play the Tascam through stereo, and I play the guitar through a practice amp, so this is not even a problem for me.  Batteries won't last long if you're as slow at figuring out licks as I am. Get you the power transformer; I think it's one of those 5V types.  But again, for not having to convert tracks to some audio format and all that techno-stuff that goes with it, this is just what I was looking for. Just throw the CD in there and get to woodshedding.\t\n",

      "I bought filter for a 10ft x 30in summer scape pool which is about 1200 gallons of water. This pump is the smallest in the Intex sand filter line and puts out 1050 gph. I have had it now for a bought a week and it is really keeping the pool water clear. Before with the original filter that came with the pool my younger son, nieces, and there friends used it once and the pool was really dirty and would not clean at all. So picked this pump and the pool is crystal clear and I run it for only two hrs a day with the kids playing in it every day. For the price it's worth getting only if it's for one summer, or use it till it breaks. If you want easier  maintenance get the Intex salt water chlorinator also worth it. You can do pool chemicals but you have to keep up on a lot more. The only thing I don't like about this size filter is the leaf trap and how it's designed on this smallest of the Intex sand filter pump. Wish it was designed like the other ones. You have to stop the water flow from pool to pump with valves or plug and on the bigger ones 2100 gph and higher you don't need to cut of the flow of water to clean out the leaf trap. But still a kickass little pump.  Please anyone who reads this and decides to buy any Intex sand filter pump, please put the size of your pool and the size of the sand filter pump you got. It would help people pick the right pump size for there pool. And how long you run it for. Thanks\t\n",

      "UPROOTED was an amazing and lyrical epic fantasy. Agnieszka is a young woman who has grown up in the shadow of the Dragon's tower and in the shadow of the Wood which is filled with danger and corruption. Each ten years the Dragon picks a seventeen-year-old girl to be his servant. At the end of that time, the girl doesn't come back to the valley. Everyone knows that the Dragon will be picking Agnieszka's best friend Kasia who is beautiful, brave, and talented -- but everyone is wrong.  Agnieszka has to find her way in the Dragon's tower when she never expected to be there. She also finds herself reluctantly learning magic and, even more reluctantly, getting involved in the bigger political picture. The Wood captures her friend Kasia and, despite it never happening before, Agnieszka manages to recover her from the Wood and clean her of the Wood's corruption. But Kasia is greatly changed by the experience. When Prince Marek learns that Kasia has been rescued, he pursuades (actually it is closer to blackmail) Agnieszka and the Dragon to attempt to rescue his mother, the Queen, who was stolen more than 20 years before.  This one has everything. It has a feisty heroine who isn't going to do anything the conventional way and who has a fierce loyalty to those she loves. It has a mysterious wizard who is tasked with keeping the Wood away from the human lands. It has a prince who will do anything and pay any price to rescue his mother. It has various other wizards of varying power and personalities. It has strange creatures. It has battles. It has friendship and love.  Fans of epic fantasy won't want to miss this excellent story.\t\n",

      "UPDATE!!! (Oct 08, 2013)  In my previous review I had mentioned that i would update on how the case was holding up. It has been almost two months now since I have given my sister the case and she has had it on her Galaxy S4 the entire time. She doesn't really go out much other than your occasional errands and to and from work. She usually carries it in hand with her wallet, or in her sweat shirt pocket. There has been some smudging on the outer pink cover from being in her pockets or rubbing on other materials. A friend of mine also has the same case and she is a bit more rough with her case and it's constantly being tossed around in her bag/purse. The pink has faded tremendously and she said she has tried everything to restore it like new. I heard a few methods of cleaning and restoring the cover:  1. Alcohol swabs 2. Baby wipes (which my sister has tried and does not work.) 3. Warm, soapy water with a rag or cloth.  So in a nutshell...if you are a busy woman and are constantly having it in your purse when it gets banged around or constantly in your pockets, you might not want to get such a light color like this highlighter pink. :) Maybe an Admiral Blue! Like myself...My job is very demanding so I always have my phone in my back pocket of my jeans. So I ordered an Otterbox Commuter Series in the \"Marine\" color combo. :D  ORIGINAL REVIEW (Aug 21, 2013)  I recently ordered the Wild Orchid Otterbox Defender and i absolutely love it!  First...the pink is more of a highlighter pink. Very vibrant, and the gray is a bit darker than in the picture...but not by much. I originally bought this case for my sister for her birthday and I'm seriously considering on buying one for myself. The one thing that i worry about this case is that when put into a pocket for a long period of time, the dye of the jeans might bleed onto the case at some point and leave marks...but this is just a theory. It happened once before when i had an Otterbox for my old iPhone 4, but maybe that won't happen this time.  Second...the 2-3 layers protect the phone all around! The volume and Lock Rockers are easy to press, you don't have to put force when pressing the buttons. I read in one review that someone had an issue with the case not properly locking into the holster, causing their phone to slide or fall out because of it. I don't see that ever happening with this at all...it locks in firmly, even when you wiggle the case while in the holster. I think that person might not have \"clicked\" into place. And of course, the holster/stand works as it should. The clip rotates all around and is easy to clip onto your jeans/belts.  But all in all...the case has owned up to its reputation and is protecting her phone! i will be ordering my own very soon!  i will update this review if anythings changed.\t\n",

      "I've been using J-B Weld for 36 years.  For a DIY'er with a house, workshop, vehicles, tractors and mowers, the uses are endless.  I keep a supply of both the industrial size as well as the smaller size on hand.  However, there is one BIG secret:  PREPARATION!  If the joining surface of the material to be fused is not prepared correctly, it will NOT work.  First, the surfaces must be roughed up a bit. On steel, iron, aluminum or any metal, I use a course grinding wheel if possible.  A file works fine if you have a supply of elbow grease.  My favorite method on small surfaces is using a tungsten carbide cutter bit with a Dremel.  Second, clean the surface thoroughly with acetone.  Do not use alcohol.  Acetone evaporates in a very few seconds.  Once the surface is dry, apply J-B Weld and allow it to cure. Repairing cracks is a breeze.  If I have a broken item in two parts, I rig some sort of jig to keep pressure on the joint while it cures.  With J-B Weld, Liquid Nails, Acetone and fiberglass cloth, there are not too many things that can't be repaired.  I had a concrete fountain bowl that weighed over 200 pounds in the front yard.  Weather extremes and age caused it to break in half on the pedestal.  My failure to keep the drainage holes clean in winter might have had something to do with it.  I cleaned it up, propped up one half on its side, covered both halves thoroughly and liberally J-B Weld and placed the halves together.  I allowed them to sit there and cure for a week.  I then covered both sides with a thick layer of exterior construction Liquid Nails and allowed it to dry another week before placing the heavy bowl back on the pedestal. That was over a year ago.  The repaired joint will last longer than the original concrete.  If you are so inclined, you can mix up a thin mixture of J-B Weld with acetone so it will completely saturate a piece of fiberglass cloth and repair a 6-foot crowbar.  Repairs are only limited by one's imagination.\t\n",

      "I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.  Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.\t\n",

      "This is the second identical mixer I bought. First one was bought about a year ago and still running in good condition. This mixer can easily handle day-to-day use with no issue. The only feedback I get from users is that they would rather have the connection at the back on the mixer instead on top. However, if you have a tight space, input/output on the top of the mixer is perfect.  Update (10/20/2014) Now I ran into issue like some of the reviewers (digital signal processor is overloading) on my newer unit. Old one still works fine and no issue. It seems like the units manufacturing from a certain time has similar issue. if you run into the same issue, contact Behringer customer support for repair. They are very prompt (compared to a lot other non-Amazon services) and took time responding via Email with detailed instruction.  Just got my repaired queued in and will update in future if necessary.  Update (06/15/2015) Since I made the repair last year, the digital signal processor is overloading issue has been gone. Have to give credit to the customer rep. They are very patient and walk throught the repair process step by step. The only down side is there is no repaire shop close by so I have to make the mixer back to their repair shop and use my old mixer for about a week. However, it worth it. If you ever have the same issue, definitely contact the manufacturing team and get it fixed.\t\n",

      "We were concerned about our 16 week old Morkie shedding. We were seeing more hair on our clothes after playing with him as it became warmer. My son and daughter were also starting to cough like crazy and we were worried it was due to pet hair (when an air purifier didn't stop the coughing). (The dog was also starting to cough and hack - he licks himself a lot.)  The furminator was just waaaay out of budget. The reviews on this looked good, so I went ahead and purchased it.  First, install the batteries and turn the massager on when brushing the dog. It keeps the dog calmer and seems to prevent the machine from pulling as much hair out. I tried it first without batteries and he really didn't like it AT ALL. He was willing to lie back and was more calm with the massager on.  My Morkie usually looks like a ball of fluff after being groomed. After using this brush, there was definitely less hair on him. The adorable poof was gone :-( (that was yesterday).  He went to the vet today, so I decided to use the deshedder on him again when he came back because dogs tend to shed more when they go to the vet. I think I got more hair out today than I did yesterday and I fear it might be pulling his hair out more than removing loose hair. I say this because he's usually very passive about being groomed, but he's tried to bite this brush when it gets stuck in his hair and then pulls.  I'm using very light strokes. I'm making sure not to press down, but I have no idea how a low to no shed dog can have THIS MUCH loose hair in a 24 hour period! I wish the instructions said how often it could be used.  On the plus side, my children are no longer coughing and neither is the dog, but I'm still keeping an eye on all of them. The dog was starting to look like he needed a haircut, but now he looks neat again.  I think I might only use this once  or twice a week or when I start seeing hair on my clothes. I really don't want a bald morkie.  21 March 2012  Finally received an email back from the company regarding my concerns about the deshedder possibly leaving me with a bald dog. This is NOT intended for low shed dogs, so if you have one, please DO NOT BUY! It WILL make your dog bald. I have since retired the deshedder and given my pup an ultra short haircut.\t\n",

      "This is the second version of NIS I own.  Like the previous one, the software firewall and NAV do a good job most of the time.  I say most because, once in a while (esp. with the firewall), it fails to exhibit the right behavior. For example, the firewall has a nasty habit of forgetting the rules you already set up for a specific application.  This version is much improved in this regard than the 2001 version, but it sometimes still asks you to set up access rules for an application -- as common as IE! -- repeatedly.  I don't know what's got into its \"head.\"  I discovered that, for one, Norton can't distinguish between the DOS-style filename and Windows-style long filename, so it thinks it's two separate applications.  But there are also other cases where the behavior simply cannot be explained. In addition to the firewall and anti-virus utilities, NIS 2002 comes with parent control (I didn't install this) and ad-blocking.  Ad-blocking is a joke.  It worked the first day I installed it, and stopped working after that. These little things exemplify the problem with many Norton products of late.  They are basically solid, but they have a lot of little annoying \"features\" -- such as not uninstalling themselves cleanly -- that really make users both love and hate them.  Sloppy programming, perhaps because they outsource part of the job to India?  I don't know.  I just hope Symantec does some homework and make their products more solid and polished.  Indeed, if ZoneAlarm did not intermittently and mysteriously break my Internet access, I wouldn't have bought this upgrade.\t\n",

      "I previously had a Drinkwell, which was pure junk, and decided to replace it with something that wasn't loud, and didn't scare the cat. My cat never took to the Drinkwell, and after reading up on it I found several claims, supposedly by vets, that stated if you have a long hair cat or one that has a major aversion to getting wet, the Drinkwells, and any other fountain that can splash or flick water in their face, they will probably not use it. So I looked at this one because it is supposed to be completely splash-proof. And it is!  The two things I like about the Petmate is that a) its motor is completely encased inside the machine, and b) the water runs down a little slide. The motor being inside the fountain, rather than on the bottom like the Drinkwells, means it is much more muffled. Late at night I can hear it pumping when all the TVs and radios are off and everyone is in bed. It is quieter than most aquarium pumps already, but being inside the fountain, then covered up by the addition of water, it is literally whisper quiet. You don't even hear water splashing much since it is actually being funneled down a little ramp, rather than just pumped out into the air to fall inside the bowl like most fountains. I can actually hear my cat drinking over the sound of this machine, which is nice because you are always wondering if your cat is using it enough.  We were weening our cat of a bathtub faucet dependency. Though she is still angry about no more bathwater, she seems to really have taken to the Petmate fountain. It's kind of funny to watch because she seems to want to try and sample water from every square inch of the bowl, starting on the left side and working her way counterclockwise around the bowl. She'll even sniff at the little ramp, though she never drinks directly from that part. I think she's more interested in the bubbles.  The reservoir is the genius part. Instead of wasting a ton of space, they made half the fountain a detachable reservoir that can be filled. I personally clean this fountain once a week, every Sunday, and so far I have not even had to scrub muck out of any corners or crevices. Why? Because there doesn't seem to be many corners or crevices on this machine. Very rounded at every angle. I would have no fear about letting this fountain run for a few weeks without a cleaning if I had to be out of town or soemthing.  The only con I have found so far is that occasionally a gnat or other small bug will land in the water and get stuck on the side without the pump. The water circulates pretty well, but some things like bugs or food crumbs will often end up getting trapped on the side of the ramp where it can't be sucked into the pump. Personally, I think this is a good thing, but it does mean that particles like this may not get caught in the filter. Sure, you want crumbs to get trapped by the filter, but do you really want a rotting bug carcass in there too?  The filters are basic charcoal filters, and personally I don't really think they do much but keep out food crumbs that do get sucked into the pump. We have run it without them, and did so for a little while just to make sure the bathtub water we filled it up with still smelled and tasted like the bathtub faucet. This is how we have been weening the cat off the tub water. Out of nowhere she just really got obsessed with the bathroom faucet after fifteen years.  IF you are looking for a good, affordable pet fountain, then this is probably one of the best bets for cats. It doesn't splash their face, it is really quiet, it has a reservoir, it is very easy to clean, and maintenance and assembly are so basic and simple. It also has replacement parts, unlike most fountains, so if the pump craps out, which eventually all pumps do, you can just replace that rather than buying a whole new fountain. So far, ours has been going strong for a bout a month now and after the first few weeks, and some really bad experiences with our previous Drinkwell, the cat has really taken to this. I highly recommend this over any of the fountains I have seen offered here.\t\n",

      "Controller works fantastically. While the joystick placement may seem a bit off at first, I've grown quite accustomed to them and actually like the design.  The controller is very light, and gets an insane amount of battery life. Hooked up to my PC via a bluetooth adapter I'm ranging anywhere from 40-50 hours on a single charge cycle, which is absolutely amazing. Make sure to use the Toshiba bluetooth stack.  The controller I purchased here is absolutely authentic, and simply the Japanese release of the controller. After viewing youtube and japanese search engines I'm content to say that this is the real deal and not a counterfeit.  Also, one of the most important things for me as someone who plays 2d platformers is the d-pad. The d-pad here is excellent, and very faithful to classic Nintendo fashion.  Easily one of the better wireless controllers on the market. I almost forgot to mention: The triggers here are digital, and not analog. I've grown absolutely frustrated with analog triggers due to their uselessness outside of racing games. Nintendo doesn't include them, and it makes the controller that much better - The triggers here do what I want, which is a quick, simple command engagement. I wish other companies would do this, or at least make it an option when purchasing additional controllers. I am not alone in wanting digital triggers - In most games analog triggers simply seem to get in the way more than anything else.\t\n",

      "I have been testing a lot of pickups lately including 3 Dimarzio Virtual Vintage, Fender Vintage Noiseless, Seymour Duncan Quarter Pounder, Fender RI 54 fiber bobbin, stock American Standard and other humbuckers. I end up with this cheap MIM pups and cannot be happier. I only use the neck and middle since I use the Gibson P94 in the bridge already. I don't know how good is the bridge.  One thing to watch out. You have to use 250K pot. It will sound bright with 500K pot. It is not muddy at all. Also I found the D and G string too loud. But this is an easy fix. I just push the two magnet down a little and solve the problem. This set use the same plastic bobbin like the American Standard where the magnet can be push up and down. If you have the fiber bobbin like the so called \"Vintage\" ones, you are out of luck if the sound is not balance. All you can do is to lower the pup and the signal get too weak.  It is surprisingly good sounding pup. I choose it not because of the price, more like in spike of the price. Now my American Strat has Mexican pickup!!!\t\n",

      "We are waiting anxiously for our WPG to be big enough to come home.  I'm preparing the house, puppy proofing, and checking out crates.  This bed really appealed to me because I've owned the cedar stuffed/plaid/fleecy kinds of beds before with my prior best friend, a standard schnauzer (RIP, sweet old pal!) and now that we are finally ready for another dog in our life, and because I'm more eco-conscious, I'm ready for something a little different bed-wise.  I bought this based on reviews, and because I was not liking the \"normal\" beds available through costco, petsmart, or even amazon.  I've seriously owned a lot of dog beds, and I am DEFINITELY impressed with the quality of this cover.  Hopefully, the zipper doesn't break or anything to change my mind!!  Even if it does, though, I bought the mesh insert that you stuff first.  This is a high-quality canvas duck tough cover.  You stuff it with your old jeans, worn out sheets, old dry towels, you name it.  Instead of ripping up a bunch of stuff for rags, or sending it off to Goodwill, you can stuff a lot of it into the handy mesh stuff bag (sold separately) and then push it all into this darling cover.  $25 plus $14 for the stuff sack, and that's MUCH less than I paid for the cedar plaid fleecy beds that I used to buy.  Not only that, those beds all fell apart or left a lot of dust because they weren't washable.  I already have the old clothes and some old Ikea sheets I cannot stand to sleep on anymore!  So, the way I've been told to use this new type of bed if you have a puppy coming:  stuff it with recently worn/old clothes, recently slept in/old worn out sheets and blankets.  This helps the puppy become really accustomed to your family's scents, and calms him.  Now I need to find a crate mat that is as great.  The sacks will hold a LOT, this medium sized cover is quite large, as most people are stating in their own reviews.  The canvas cover is washable (I got the red one with the bird, so adorable in real life!  Definitely a wash on cold separately item.) And if you dump everything into a washing machine that's inside the mesh, you've got a fresh clean bed for your exhausted doggy!  I already love this, and I'm still 4 weeks away from bringing home our new darling.  Cannot WAIT!\t\n",

      "Here is yet another great set from Bach Guild. I'm now about halfway through it, and the highlight so far is a fabulous performance of Gluck's \"Orfeo e Euridice.\" Maureen Forrester, the greatest contralto of her generation, is downright awesome as Orfeo. I don't think she ever sang any better than this. Teresa Stich-Randall is fine, as ever, as Euridice, and the young Charles Mackerras wields a supportive and sensitive baton as he conducts Bach Guild's standby Vienna State Opera Orchestra. This performance alone is more than worth your 99 cents. Check out the reviews of the earlier CD release here, where it's selling from 3rd parties for $39.99:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gluck-Orfeo-Euridice/dp/B0000023D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gluck: Orfeo & Euridice</a>. Now admittedly, Gluck's Orfeo is not a baroque choral work, but I'm not complaining! Another favorite is the Pergolesi Stabat Mater--I started with this because I like the soprano, Stich-Randall, and mezzo Elizabeth Hngen. The recording also features Anton Heiller on organ and Mario Rossi conducting the VSOO. It's gorgeous! I've also enjoyed the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi could really write for voices as well as he could write for fiddles) and John Blow's impassioned \"Ode on the Death of Henry Purcell\". Blow had been Purcell's teacher and sponsor and so this work is especially personal. Also lovely is Charpentier's Magnificat--a graceful and melodius setting. I haven't hit a bad performance yet, and I'm looking forward to exploring further. Unless I've missed something, there are no duplicates with previous Bach Guild releases, which is a bit of a feat in itself, given how much music Bach Guild has given us in the past few years.\t\n",

      "I recently was running 'AVG free edition' on my Dell dual core Vista PC with 3GB RAM. Just the other day, I was attacked by a 'Trojan' virus, which AVG could not apparently get rid of (I even tried a full system scan). I still kept getting pop-up messages regarding the virus and a new tab I never had before. I also had audio advertisements running without my choosing at times, even when I closed my browser! Talk about annoying. So I decided to can 'AVG' and go with Norton 360, which I downloaded. It seems to be working in some regards, but a full system scan took nearly 6 hours (5 hours, 50 minutes to be exact)! Is this normal?  UPDATE 6/26: Today, Norton 360 keeps asking me to re-start my computer, each and every time I turn it on!  2 starts every time I want to use my PC?  Are you kidding me?!  Ridiculous!  It also did not stop yet another Trojan virus, which it cannot 'quarantine' or get rid of.  Now I have 2 tabs i've never had before, and the ad music keeps playing again, even when i'm logged off of my 'Explorer' browser.  And 'Windows Security Center' does not work at all.  It has been disabled (I get a message stating that 'the security center can't be started').  I cannot turn it on or off, which includes updates and firewall settings too!  In addition, many applications run very slowly, or don't run at all when Norton is updating automatically!  You would think a 'full system scan' would have taken care of my issues.  There is a reason this crappy security suite is 63% off (at time of download)! What a waste of 32 dollars.  I am going to try Kaspersky, and hope it fares better than this.\t\n",

      "Com'on people, lighten up.  We've been waiting 8 years for this.  This is a different distributor, so we should understand they were probably not going to \"pick right up where Fox left off\".  It's not like this is going to be a huge seller.  As much as we love the series, we are WAY in the minority here.  At best, the individual seasons would sell for $15 to $20.  So instead of paying $40 for the final two, for another $40 you get the whole series, in a matched set.  Life is too short, I'm not going to let something this insignificant keep me from viewing clean, unedited versions of my favorite series of all time.  My current set I recorded off of Nick probably 15 years ago, transferred to MPEG files about 12-13 years ago, cut and edited them with some cheesy video editor from the early 2000's, and got them down to around 750 MB so that each would fit on a CD.  My backups have also clogged up my hard drives over the years.  $79 to get rid of all this headache and have the complete series? Bargain!!!!  Thanks for the wonderful series Mr. Newhart, just a timeless classic that we love so much.  The Doctor is IN!!!  ADDED 5/27:  Got the set in today, worth the money.  I haven't compared the quality to the 4 Season set from Fox, but I did compare a couple of episodes to my mpeg versions I recorded 15 or so years ago.  The episodes are un-cut, which is great, but one other thing I noticed right off the bat is the episodes are the correct speed.  Syndication cuts episodes, but they also tend to speed them up to get more of the episode into the allotted 30 minute air time.  I was really surprised how much quicker the pace was on the old recordings, with all of the actor's voices a little higher as a result.  The new set is much more naturally-paced, more relaxed.  The video of the new set is not perfect, but it is very, very good.  I give it about 8.5 on a 1-10 scale.  It doesn't have that super clean, prisitine look of a big name series that has been fully restored from top-notch source elements.  But it is certainly cleaner than any Newhart episodes I have seen before, including the Fox videos.  The video is excellent for the most part and is consistent from episode to episode.  The audio is great, much cleaner than my recorded set which had a lot of hissing.  It is perfect for a 70's sitcom, I give the audio a 9.5 out of 10.  In any case, the purchase was well worth the $79.  Season 5 is one of my favorites, so I'm going to really enjoy the new set, and not worry about the $40 extra.  All in all..... \"Fine and Dandy\"!!\t\n",

      "I like this tent. It is the 96x48x84 inch one. The metal frame has metal corners, not the plastic ones found on other tents, which was a plus. It feels shaky & I was concerned about stability at first. But I have 3 air cooled hoods hanging, which is the max I would suggest, considering the frame structure. I am on my 3rd cycle using this tent & it is still holding up just fine. I wish the front zipper zipped from the bottom up, rather than from the top down. This is because when you unzip it, the negative air pressure pulls the flaps inward & I am always afraid they will hit my plants. But I am aware of the issue & don't allow that to happen. Also, after using the front zipper as much as I doo, I noticed the zipper was starting to seperate a bit at the very top. This is because of how often it is opened & closed. However, I took a little needle & thread & just reinforced it a bit with a few stitches to prevent it from tearing or coming apart, which worked out well. Another thing I really like is that the bottom has an insert which is about 4 inches tall, which catches any spillage or overflow if you are growing hydro. I accidentally leaked about a gallon or two of water by knocking off a drip line & the tray caught all the water, which I just used a shop-vac to clean up. But it prevented it from soaking the floor beneath the tent. I expect to get several more grows from this tent & I would definitely buy this tent again if I needed to. I would probably also position a new tent in such a way that I use the side openings to access my reservoir, because like I said, the front zipper/opening is a bit tight & over time the zipper will wear a bit. The side openings are not as tight to get zippered.\t\n",

      "The size I ordered is good! a medium for a not toy Chihuahua mix. The length is perfect. it appears fine until I put the little guy in it!!! He is well behaved and lets me put it on him only to find that he is completely unable to walk in this coat. It trips him! And that's with all the pulleys and ties adjusted. honestly, I don't even know exactly what is tripping him but his legs get stuck immobile and they pop out of the holes..it's a mess. I think it's a lack of flexibility between the legs.  He just stood there motionless staring at me the 5th time I tried to put it on him. I got it on him successfully but he was afraid to move knowing he would trip if he tried to walk. He just stood there like a statue---staring at me like, \"what are you doing to me?\"  I should have got one of the similar items on amazon that has the open hole in the front so it let's his front legs move freely!! I didn't know any better. IN ADDITION, just realized this hood is not removable, it is sewn in. It appears that on styles other than camo the hood comes off. Planning on returning. Maybe other dogs are not immobilized by this jacket, too bad mine is because it was pouring today.\t\n",

      "I had an old steel shed, on a concrete pad that was in place when we bought out house. It was a little marginal when we moved in, and has only gotten moreso over the years. I decided it was finally time to replace it. My goals were: had to fit on current pad. I wanted to be able to stand upright easily. I wanted it brighter, and well ventilated - the old shed was perpetually dark and dank, with about a 5 foot height at the peak.  I started looking at this shed due to it's unique size. There are lots of 8x10 sheds, but this was 10x8 - the door was on the long dimension. Not only would this fit my pad better, it meant items have less of a tendency to end up \"in the back\" behind a bunch of other things.  Shopped a lot, and ultimately ordered here on Amazon, as the price was substantially better than my local stores. While shopping/waiting, watched a few YouTube videos on assembly (search on 10x8, not 8x10). Not necessary, but picked up a few tips, that might have saved us a little \"figuring out time\".  Shed arrived in just a few days - much faster than I thought. Mine was shipped via Ceva Logisitics. They were great. Got a call when it was available, to schedule delivery, and had emails almost every day with status and reminders. They delivered at the scheduled time, and maneuvered the delivery into my backyard patio (a somewhat complicated path) as requested.  It arrived on a very long pallet - at least double long, and standard width. They had a pallet jack, but it was complicated as they had to carry it in the \"long\" dimension\" to get through gates. and the \"nose\" tended to drag. Two boxes, stacked on top of each other. My neighbor joked that it looked like a coffin. That is about the size. perhaps a bit taller. The shipping weight was between 500 and 600 pounds.  I'm 50ish, and fairly handy. I arranged for a couple of my nephews to spend some time with me to assemble. One is Jr Hi, one is High school - also fairly handy.  I would say the three of us spent about 12 hours, across 2 days, pulling out the old shed, and assembling this one. Probably only a couple hours were spent on the old shed, so call it 10 hours. Please bear in mind we had a very solid, level, concrete pad all ready to go. If you need to prepare an area, you will need to factor in that additional time. This seems REALLY important to get a good level base under it. You could do it with 2 people, although that third set of hands was really good to have now and then. 2 people might take a bit longer. It would be a struggle with one person I think.  Shed went up with no real issues. We could do it again in much less time, as we would save the \"figure it out\" portion. The instructions are good. Mostly pictures, with minimal verbiage. Where there is verbiage, PAY ATTENTION to it. All parts bags are labeled, so do not open them until you need them. We spent a fair bit of time cross-referencing parts to make sure we had the right things. We spent a little time fiddling with the door and latch. You'll need screwdrivers, wrenches or sockets. Pliers. A step ladder. A rubber mallet was useful - perhaps not necessary. Once the walls go up (very quickly) if you are in the sun, it can get a little warm in there. There are *alot* of screws, and they recommend not using a screw gun. a side not: A bunch of extra screws. I really appreciate that. IF you loose one, you are not in too much trouble.  The completed shed is very nice. 3 windows (two in front, one in rear which opens). 2 skylights. 2 screened vents. A shelf running the full length of the two short walls (front to back), and 2 corner shelves. You can rearrange where you put the shelves. We found that the steel rails that hold the shelves added to the structural strength of the two side walls, so we put one on each. The steel truss system that holds up the roof is VERY strong. The shed has a somewhat complicated roofline, so there are a bunch of pieces there. You can make the walls bow a bit if you lean into them (perpahs not as bad as mu old steel shed). The aforementioned steel shelving rails help that quite a bit. There are a bunch of other accessories you can buy - shelves, hooks, baskets etc. The door has a spot for a padlock. I' guessing this is more of deterrent, as this is after all a vinyl shed. One door (left) anchors top and bottom with a deadbolt. The other door (right) has the latching mechanism. You only need to open the right door to enter exit the shed. If you open both, you have a very wide opening, for wheelbarrows, snowblowers or the like. There is a page that tells you how to level the shed with shims if the doors are binding.  The shed is not anchored to the ground - although that would not be hard to do. It does have a floor, so once there is a few hundred pounds of assorted garden equipment in there, it is not likely to go anywhere. If you live in an area with really high winds, or you are building it in a really open windy area, on top of a hill or something you might want to take steps.  The door is about 6'4\" in height at the center. The truss system is several inches higher than that, about 6'8\" . Most folks will clear ok, or if not, you may need to duck in the door. The actual roof peak is about 8\". The lowest part of the roof - at the wall is about 6'. Very bright and airy inside. The shed looks very nice - it is light tan, with brown doors and roof.  Had a light rain today. Seems watertight. The rood drainage system is clever.  Very pleased. Hope this is useful.\t\n",

      "I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected. I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.  It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.  I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie. The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.  There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.  My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.  Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.  17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'.\t\n",

      "This is one of the most interesting, different heads I've used.  It appears to be clear at first glance, but actually it has several \"bubbles\" all over the surface.  I must clarify, they are not actual bubbles that are raised at all; the surface is smooth as any drumhead.  There are just some air pockets in the oil layer between the plies, which is intentional and is not a defect.  Weird, but not a bad thing.  The sound?  Warm, with short sustain.  A Remo Diplomat this is most definitely not.  Almost a \"thick\" sound, IMO.  Very 70's arena rock.  Though I like the sound, I found it was a bit hard to get a definite tuning pitch.  On the upside, however, I found that I didn't need to use Moongels, O-Rings, or any other dampener on my it.  Another plus: it is as tough as nails.  I've beat the crap out of this head and it still sounds the same as day one.  Jazzers should stay away, but for rock, blues, and bar band drummers, this head is great.\t\n",

      "(corrected 1/9/17) I recently rebuilt my pedal board in order to reduce its overall foot print. I run six pedals with a total max draw of 454 mA. The largest portion of that consumption belongs to my TC Electronic Nova Repeater @ 300 mA. In my old pedal board configuration, I ran all of the pedals off of a Visual Sound OneSpot, using the board's internal distribution and jumpers to supply all of the pedals. Never had a problem. The new board is a piece of plywood and doesn't have internal distribution capability so I thought it would be good to get a power supply that wouldn't require daisy chaining. The reviews for this product were quite good, especially for the price, so I bought it and installed it on my new pedal board. During rehearsal last night, the rig got it's first shakedown. The power supply worked on all of my pedals but one - the aforementioned Nova Repeater. When plugged into the Moozikpro Mini Power Supply, the LED of whatever channel I plugged it into immediately dimmed and the pedal powered off. I tried several different channels and jumpers, but all had the same result - it couldn't power my chorus. I fortunately had another power supply with me and ran it to the pedal and had no additional problems. If the channels on this power supply are truly isolated, then there should be specs as to what current and voltage draw each individual channel is capable of. I could find no such specifications. Had I seen them in advance, I might have made a different choice based on my pedal complement. The weight of the reviews for this product suggest that it works for many, but it didn't work for me. I guess I will get a longer daisy chain cable for my OneSpot and go back to that since it has always been reliable for my rig.\t\n",

      "If you haven't read the first book, \"Bitten\", reading this one would be like coming upon a really bad accident. You don't know what happened to get to this point, it looks really ugly and you hope that everyone involved will be okay, but you don't know if you will stick around to ever find out what really happens.  The story picks up where the last one left off, at Benedict's apartment. Ben just told Ally that she was in danger, then he leaves her alone to make a phone call and to make a cup of tea. Huh? When he figures out that Ally has been abducted and the clock is ticking down, instead of looking everywhere for the love of his existence, Benedict is diligently doing his paperwork. Seriously?! And Moira, the person with the most to gain if Ally can't be found in time, couldn't possibly be responsible...could a vampire possibly be any more naive? Moira somehow managed to not only find out about and kidnap Ally, but her friends as well, in less time than it took for Ben and Ally to decide to become intimate. Golly gee, what'll happen next? Be sure to tune in for the next episode....sigh.  Believe it or not, the story line in this book is a bit better than the first one. Of course, it couldn't have gotten much worse (not worst!). But this is mostly because Ally's juvenile character and exclamatory sentences aren't as prominent in this book. However, the grammar is probably worse, if you can believe it. I showed a couple of the errors to my 16 year old son and the first thing he asked me was, \"Did you pay any money for this?\" Luckily I was able to tell him \"no\".  And the one thing that almost stopped me from getting these books in the first place - is anyone else concerned about the fact that the first two books in this paranormal romance series have the exact same names as the first two in Kelley Armstrong's \"Women of the Otherworld\" series? Of course, that is where the resemblance ends. They do say that plagiarism...er, I mean... imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I guess it's not THAT big of a deal, but it just bugs me.  If the final book in this serialized novel is free, I'll probably read it just to find out what happens, but I wouldn't pay for it.\t\n",

      "So while at RT, Jeanne C. Stein mentioned to me when I was chatting with her at the E-book Expo that her novella, Cloud City was going to be available for FREE during the convention. So later that night I made sure to download this one. Can pass up free now can you?  It was a pretty good story too! Sophie Deveraux, Belinda Burke's sister, needs Anna's help. She still houses the vampire ghost Jonathan inside of her and he's decided that he wants to write a book about this life! I mean, who doesn't want to read a vampire book these days? Plus it's about a real vampire too! But things start to get a little dicey. Sophie isn't too sure of their editor who wants to publish the book.  Turns out the editor knows more about Jonathan that Sophie thought. Apparently, Jonathan turned his great grandmother into a vampire years ago, essentially ruining their family name and all that jazz. He wants revenge. Anna is there for backup and protection, but it turns out Sophie has other plans than just trying to help Jonathan with his book and keep his...or her head. Sophie is going to get Jonathan once and for all and get her life back.  Anna is sort of concerned because she thinks Sophie might be taking the same dark path that her sister, Belinda took awhile back. But Sophie is so determined to get rid of Jonathan, she wants to be in control of her life and not have to share it with him, no matter what benefits housing the spirit of a once vampire may have.  This was a nice quick read. Very enjoyable, but isn't one of those that really ties itself into the series. Like not reading this novella won't leave you confused in a book in the series. This was purely just a fun read!  There was an interesting turn of events towards the end, that I didn't really expect to happen. I guess I was thinking something more deadly and sinister. The ending was actually quite nice!\t\n",

      "It's rare when an add-on for hand-held electronics is both essential AND affordable.  This one is both.  Currently priced at $11 (I paid $15), this is an absolute steal that had made my Vita experience better in every way. The grips snap on simply and easily. Takes two seconds. Once on, they feel like an extension of the unit. Only once or twice, during rough handling on my part, have they risked coming off.  They make holding the Vita FAR more comfortable, somewhat similar to holding a standard controller. Gone are the hand and wrist cramps I used to get from extended usage. They make the unit a little bulkier, yes, but the tradeoff is TOTALLY worth it.  No jacks, buttons, or other features are obscured by the grips.  The grips also turn the shoulder buttons into triggers. I prefer this and find that action games control much better this way. The triggers are responsive and fast; I've see no difference in performance using them.  Finally, one unadvertised feature is that these grips double as a protector/case when it comes to side impacts. They won't protect the front and back screens, but they do protect the outer edges of the unit.  Bottom line is, for just $11, no Vita user should be without these.\t\n",

      "Oooooooo weeeeeee.  Finally we get to see where life takes Kellan and Kiera, our crazy couple who we love and hate.  Well, I think we all love Kellan and hate Kiera, but we might just hate her because she has Kellan and well, we live in reality.  The story picks up where Effortless left off.  Kellan and Kiera are madly in love and the D-Bags are on the brink of hitting it big.  As we all know, fame and fortune isn't all it's cracked up to be and sometimes it comes with a price.  People will try to take advantage of your situation for their own motives and unfortunately, our D-Bags and their lead singer are their newest targets.  All sorts of people come out of the woodwork to take advantage of the hype that is surrounding the D-Bags as they are about to explode.  \"Well, if I've learned anything in this business, it's that you either roll with the punches, or your simply roll over.  And I'm not rolling over for anyone.\"  Kellan never wanted the fame and fortune.  He just loves to make music.  But he puts up with it all because the other guys in the band don't have anything else to fall back on.  He sacrifices things for his band brothers because they sacrificed so much for him when they were still trying to make it big.  \"It takes a special person to be able to handle all of the attention he'll receive.  Are you sure you're that woman?\"  Kiera, of course hates the attention.  She hated the attention Kellan got when he was just playing at Pete's.  Now he was on his way to rock super stardom and the attention he would receive would be unparalleled.  Could she handle throngs of wannabe groupies throwing themselves at him where ever he went?  Trust has always been a big issue in their relationship, considering how they started out.  Could she trust him to be faithful?  Could he trust her to stick by him no matter what?  Would this all become too big for them to handle?  Sure it was one thing to be in love without the whole world knowing, but could their relationship last all the scrutiny?  Would Kiera stick it out with Kellan though the good and bad or would she run back to Seattle where things were normal and easier?  This leads me to the story.  The story is good.  Really good.  I was shocked at how long and thick it was (insert \"That's What She Said\" joke)!  But that didn't matter because I couldn't put the darn thing down!  You will fall in love with the characters and their development.  Some of them grow so much from when we first met them in Thoughtless and some, not so much.  You'll be loving them, hating them, wanting to smack them and wanting them to push you up against a wall.  You'll have these feelings within pages of each other.  It's almost exhausting, but so worth it.  S.C. Stephens did not disappoint her faithful fans in this last installment of the Thoughtless series.  I'm sad that it's over, but I'm ok with how it ended.  And I think everyone will be too.\t\n",

      "After purchasing this timer I was extremely happy with it. No more trying to remember to turn off the bathroom fan after a shower/bath. I was so happy with it that I told coworkers what a great purchase it was. Now 7 months later it started making a noticeable buzzing noise. It honestly sounded like an alarm clock. The longer it ran the quieter the noise became. I was hoping it would fix itself. No luck.....after it became obvious that it was not going to stop buzzing I thought about ordering a replacement, going so far to actually place the order. Then I started reading reviews of others' who experienced the same buzzing sound and saw that some of them called Leviton's customer service for a replacement. I quickly cancelled my order and called Leviton. I eventually ended up talking to Ashley F. and explained my situation to her. Ashley graciously offered to send out a replacement timer, she was quite curtious and renewed my hy confidence in what a CSR is supposed to be. Within 4 days I received the replacement timer (shipped free of charge) and was back in business. So far - so good. Any issues and I will post another review.

      "Yes, it is a very light hose. When they say \"zero G\", they really, really mean it. I don't say that as a compliment.  The problem is, no, it is not ultra flexible, except when it doesn't have water in it.  Worse, it has a mind of its own. It will suddenly leap up off the ground and flop over onto my delicate potted plants, smashing their branches and even knocking smaller pots over.  I bought this hose to replace an $8 drinking-water-quality hose I'd found at WalMart. The reason that I didn't find that hose acceptable was that it's pretty stiff plastic, which meant that it required a lot of space in which to drag it around in a wide circle. I have a very small yard which I have packed full of potted plants, with narrow walking paths all through the pots. I needed a TRULY \"ULTRA FLEXIBLE\" hose to navigate through the yard.  The best hose that I've ever used for tiny, fussy spaces like this is the kind that is sold as an \"RV hose\". These hoses, too, are very lightweight and very flexible, but *they lay flat on the ground* as you walk around with them, even if there is a trigger sprayer on the end. However, they recently stopped making those hoses with metal ends. I broke the plastic end of one of them after only 6 months, and the last one I bought came pre-leaking. So I had to give up on that kind of hose.  But it never occurred to me that I could expect the Zero-G to rear up several feet in the air and lay waste to my fuchsias and drag dirt all over my clothing in the process, and then continue to flop back and forth onto the plants as I pulled it down the garden path.  It doesn't help to turn the pressure to the hose down. When I do so, yes, the hose does relax quite a bit, but ONLY as long as I am pulling the trigger. As soon as I let go of the trigger, the pressure in the hose builds up again allowing it to stiffen so that it can continue its snake-dance. So I need to walk around with the hose constantly running to maintain its flexibility. And anyway, to get this relaxation effect, I have to turn the pressure down so far that I then don't have sufficient pressure to complete my tasks.  If you have a big, wide open lawn in which to wrestle with this magic snake, or if you just need to drag a hose across the driveway to wash a car, then this is probably a good hose for you. I recommend wearing your bathing suit, though, because the hose *will* bounce up off the ground and attack you. Also great for kids who want to pretend to be snake charmers.  (I'm not sure, but I think the reason that it behaves this way is that the inner plastic hose is not actually attached to the outer cloth sleeve. Thus, even if I am firmly grasping the hose with two hands, it can still merrily twist out of my grasp.)  Other than the difficulty controlling the hose, I don't like the material itself. I had assumed that because this is a *hose*, the cloth sleeve wouldn't be absorbent. I don't want to get so wet simply because I am watering my pots.\t\n",

      "After years of struggling with the woefully inadequate Quicken 2007 I'm baffled by all the negs this software has received.  Really, Quicken for Mac has ALWAYS stunk.  It's been a pain in my butt for six years.  Then this year, 2013, they changed the current file format so that it was going to be an even bigger pain to convert data back to the 2007 software.  I'd had enough.  I first started with Quicken Essentials.  I cannot believe I fell for it again.  Essentials is a joke.  It's a $10 program at best.  Then I found iBank and it was perfect from the get-go.  My primary purpose for this software is to code business expenses for the tax Schedule C form.  If something is a cost of goods, office expense, travel, etc. I need to know and then see the totals for the year.  And I need to have separate files for each tax year.  This last part was horrendous with Quicken.  I have to really search to find past years.  People rave about Quicken from these older years and lament the current offerings.  Sorry, but for me Quicken ALWAYS sucked even when it was supposedly \"good\"!  But enough about Quicken.  iBank did the job for me and it did it quickly.  It even had a way that allowed me to code my entries faster than Quicken.  Is it slightly different?  Sure, there's a learning curve, but it was a minor one.  The only ding I can give the software was how the download process worked and I suppose its limited flexibility for people looking for a really hardcore accounting program.  For me this is good as it's ever gotten in terms of using software that works for my small business.\t\n",

      "There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  \"Joseph\" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.  This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.  Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.\t\n",

      "This holster certainly isn't cheap. But, on the plus side, it certainly isn't cheap. This is a premium holster at a premium price, and it certainly reflects it. It's held up well over the last few months, without any wear and tear to show for its use. The only thing that this holster is anything but excellent is the break in period.  First thing, the strap that holds the gun in place. The strap needs to be worked and stretched before it'll fit over the back of the gun. This won't take too long (took me a few minutes) and then it holds the gun very snugly. Second, the elastic itself. For the first couple weeks the elastic will fall into its \"true\" stretchiness and you'll likely be slightly uncomfortable during that time (either it's too tight in the morning or too lose in the afternoon) but after that it's perfect.  As to be expected, if you run, kick, or otherwise jar your ankle, you'll feel the gun move a bit. This can't be helped when you strap a couple pounds of metal to your ankle. While the gun may jostle, it does not come lose at all.  The only con one could mention is the break in period, which is to be expected with a holster of this quality and made of these materials. I do not consider price a con, as you pay more for a quality product, that's just how it is.\t\n",

What that means is the actual valve does not have the 2 adjusters, one on each side, one to control the hot overall inflow, and the other to control the cold overall inflow. The adjustable ones have a threaded adjusting rod with a seating nut so you can secure the setting once you found your ideal spot. The old Moen shower setup I was replacing had two adjustments, one that you pull away from the wall, and the other you turn in a clockwise direction for example to adjust the temperature setting. These new ones do not have that flow/pull it away from the wall option. They only adjust by spinning them around clockwise, which turns it on at a full flow, and adjusts temp considering where you leave the dial.  So to shed some light on the flow problem, my neighbor had a contractor install a shower and valve assy., one of unknown origin in their shower. It also did not have adjusters. The contractor also installed an energy saving shower massage, or shower head that produced a scant amount of flow. They complained because the flow was insufficient, which led them to taking much longer showers to get the job done of completely rinsing off. So they put on a fuller flow head, and then they didn't like it because the water flow was too much. All of this led to the problem of not having an adjustable flow control setting. You could install a couple of ball valves, or even a faucet type valve somewhere along the feed line, but that would result in you possibly having to go downstairs, and either have someone upstairs on the phone while taking a shower telling you which setting they like the best, or you have to try a setting, take a shower, try it again, etc. So it is ideal to have the 2 set screws right in front of you when you are taking the shower to get your preferences right.  All of this could be eliminated by using the combination of this high quality, yet money saving Chateau L2352, in combination with the consumer reports number one rated shower head; Moen 21777BN Brushed Nickel Inspire Inspire Seven Function Shower Head Only with 1/2 Inch Connection 21777 (or preferably get the 21778 with the shower massage setup) That puts out the preferred econo flow of 2.5 That is what I have, and I love the flow level. The satisfaction that is derived from that shower head is like the results of consumer reports; they used about 70 subjects who tried all different shower heads and flow levels, and hands down the Moen models I just mentioned won. Not only did they conserve water, they created such a large head, with so many fine jets, that you felt like you were getting flooded with water, but were actually conserving water instead. (Don't tell anyone :-) let them think they are getting the major flow model)  When I first went in to take a shower, I was anticipating a scarcer feeling flow, so much so that I wanted to even reduce it some. It was at that point that I understood that having the ideally suited adjustment would be nice. But upon taking my second shower, and having adjusted my mind to it, I loved the precise amount of flow I was already getting. (If not I could tweak it by installing the shut off valves inline) I really don't want to change a thing.  I had read in the forums that Moen does not advise you to install a shower shut off at the head, something about possibly damaging the anti-scalding valve. Calling the included 800 number for Moen was great. They are ready to answer any one of your installation etc. questions.  This Chateau model is a beautiful set. I also bought the Moen Model 1920: Chrome Remodeling Cover Plate which has the wonderful quality Moen chrome finish. It almost looks like it was hand polished as a final step. Cover plates are the wide cover that goes under the standard plate in the event that you are upgrading your old 2 handle model to this type that has the single handle and anti-scalding valve. If you need to knock out tile to open it up the hole is covered by the remodeling plate. The exact dimensions as well as other info are all available in PDF format at Moen.  My brother told me to get the brushed nickel because that was all the rage. I was considering doing a return exchange etc, but when I saw what the prices were I decided the chrome was great. The shower room is a separate room so to speak, and think when I do the bathroom, I am going to be looking for a combo brushed nickel and chrome set for the faucets which will tie it all together. I just got the Oxo Steel Garlic Press, Stainless which has that same combination which is gorgeous.  So there you have it. Get this Moen Chateau single, and save a bundle over the other models, and use the number one rated shower head to automatically adjust the flow to the precise spot you want, and save on the water bill. By the way that shower head is large enough to give you the feel of one of those very expensive huge rain shower heads, yet smaller enough to make it a comfortable hand held.  Another by the way is be sure and install the pipe to mount the head included in the kit with the long part going into the wall. That way you have sufficient clearance for the hose, away from the wall to allow the shower head to be adjusted to any position that suits you; even straight down, once again, creating that rainfall large head feeling. I'm out of space, so with all of this info you should be able to make the right decision for yourself. One note of caution pricing for these items varies widely. I did buy both the chateau shower posi-temp and cover plate here at Amazon, which had the best prices.  One final item worth mentioning is that I have an older home circa 1955 and the wall this setup is mounted into is 2 1/2\" deep, the maximum depth allowable with the kit. When I installed the cover plate, that took up another 3/4\". I was heartbroken when I felt like I had to return it for a flat plate, because the beauty of this thing, the way it is sculpted, and with a polished chrome look, I didn't want to part with it. Then I discovered that Moen sells an extension kit for walls that measure much thicker than that. All it is comprised of is a longer chrome tube that the handle mounts too, and some longer screws. So now I can enjoy the full setup including the remodeling plate. If you pull your existing plate off and take some measurements from the center of the pipe line, to the inside wall of your shower, you can use that info to check with the PDF file diagrams available for free at [...].  One more installation tip: Ignore the sticker on the valve section warning you to take it easy when soldering it in because you can damage the plastic and rubber valve components; instead, remove them altogether. It is so easy to just take it out, and then solder away the brass body. The secret to removing it is to use the included plastic removing tool. It has a square head on it so you can use a wrench or a pair of pliers to grab it. It slides down over the valve, and the 2 extender pieces sit down in there so you can spin it. Then just turn it like you would remove a jar lid, and because of the tapered sides at the top it pops. Then just use a good pair of pliers, and pull on the stem, and it comes right out. Everything that you would be concerned about overheating is contained right inside of the cartridge. The body as I mentioned is all metal. When you are done, reinstalling is even easier. Just line up the plastic tab marked H-C at the top, and top is marked \"Up\" on the housing, and push it straight in all the way. Your done. It couldn't be simpler.  Oh and one more thing. Remember how I said that the price on this stuff is all over the place. I just saw, current as of today, the model from Moen just like this one; the one with the volume control, and the price wasn't that much different than this one. So if you want to use your old shower head, and set it and forget it concerning the flow level, get that one instead. I love the consumer reports number one rated shower head mentioned above. It makes all the difference. The Chateau is nice for anti-scalding, but you won't notice much of a difference over what you already had, when you add the shower head, you are on a different planet.  The initial reason why I bought this posi-temp model is that I no longer have to fear someone flushing a toilet, or turning on a spigot in the house while I am showering and then getting scalded. I got so caught up in the design and installation stuff I almost forgot to mention that. I love my new shower setup, and I believe you will too.\t\n",

      "It still never ceases to amaze me how this high-spirited action-packed gem escaped me for all these years. My earliest recollection of this film is when I was still in grammar school catching the trailer's most infamous and notorious Harrison Ford moment when he quotes, \"Get off my plane\"!. (Priceless) Now, after all of these years have passed I can at least say that this film did not disappoint as the solid acting and fast paced action held my attention throughout the film in it's entirety. Upon viewing this film in the Blu-Ray format it made me regret not seeing it in theaters in a sense. On a more positive note, this blu-ray disc truly utilizes it's full potential of technology; moreover, it's patriotic epic score composed by the one and only Jerry GoldSmith which is also accompanied by a great sounding lossless audio track will really satisfy the home theater buffs. On an even more positive note, I feel this Blu-Ray disc was not far off or short for that in matter in delivering a true realistic theater experience because it was quite superb on many levels. I will elaborate more on these technical specs later but for now I will give a very brief summary here.  President Marshall, played by a more youthful looking and middle-aged (Harrison Ford) is held hostage along with his family and staff members on Air Force One after American Special Forces capture general Rodek who is the leader of Kazakhstan. President Marshall leaves a gorgeous and enormous looking Moscow dinner hall after delivering a very brief subdued and yet powerful speech concerning terrorism and foreign policy. Upon boarding the plane we are introduced with Ivan Korshunov who is played by the versatile and ever so impressive (Gary Oldman) While Air Force One is in flight, the audience discovers a mole in the secret service that is able to board Ivan and his other supportive terrorists companions. The secret service wastes no time in starting the bloodshed as he fires two bullets into two cabinet member's heads while they were discussing and briefing on important foreign policy matters. Soon the trails of a smoke grenade released by the secret service man signal Ivan and his ultra radical friends to unleash hell on the president and everyone else on the plane; and, that is exactly what they do because they are incredibly vengeful, bitter and quite keen on releasing General Radek.  Since we are dealing with Blu-Ray technology I always feel it is appropriate and mandatory to analyze and review the technical specs because that is what we are paying top exorbitant dollar for right? If we weren't receiving an upgrade we might as well be buying VHS right?  Well I am astounded to announce that, Blu-Ray fans won't be disappointed in this department either because the picture and sound looks and feels incredibly sharp, precise and most importantly very consistent. Despite the film's age, this disc completely revives and revamps it to a more recent looking film even with the sparse and light 90's grain subtlety prevalent throughout. Fortunately, this minor set back hardly retracts or dilutes any of the overall quality of this pristine transfer. More importantly, flesh tones are smooth and detailed throughout; hair and fabric emit some fine detail particularly in the darker interior shots of the control panel sequences. The blue colored control panel scenes are quite remarkable in the sense that it really enhances facial hair and flesh tone depth to a more elevated level of clarity in any parts of the film. Personally, no other scene compares to this high level of detail in my opinion. This attribute is more specifically shown when Gary Oldman is losing his patience when he frustratingly articulates his demands to the vice president with impunity and anger. Apart from the control panel scenes, the rest of the film does not fail to deliver in expressing some vibrantly smooth scenes in the conference rooms, bag storage area as well as the smaller private rooms (Bathroom, lounge rooms). The majority of the film takes place in the interior of the plane during the night with some interwoven scenes of the white house conference rooms so you will have to keep this in mind in order to regulate any misguided expectations. (In terms of settings, not an entire amount of variety here)  The Sound is excellent, as the flawless lossless 5.1 audio will give all your speakers quite a bit of attention; the dialogue is crisp, articulate, clean and very pleasing. I was able to make out every spoken word without any complications. You will truly appreciate the opening-firing scene at the headquarters in Kazakhstan when general Rodek is captured. Moreover, AK-47's, Mp5 and Mp5k's fire and pierce with unbelievable force and dominance, but that's not even the bread and butter here folks. The automatic sub-machine guns truly immerse you in its breath taking firepower during the first plane shootout when the terrorists kill the majority of the President's staff on board. Listen carefully to the bullets ricocheting off metal stairs or penetrating through bathroom doors. I fully appreciated the gunfire sounds in the bag storage area where President Marshall hides; it is quite impressive and mesmerizing actually. One will also quickly observe how much attention is given to the sub-woofer and rear channel speakers during the exterior night shots of the plane in fight; engines will roar loudly and thoroughly producing a strong vibration in any floor of your house. As a result, this creates a very strong acoustical sound range leading the front channel speakers and gradually dissolving to the rear. The introduction of the F-16 fighter jets following Air Force One leaves no speaker unscathed; the incessant accelerating engine power might cause one to grip on to their seats. (Well, at lease for me it did) These types of aerial vehicular sounds are nicely calculated in between scenes of dialogue and dominate the last half-hour of the film. Even though I have never seen this film on standard dvd I feel it is appropriate and safe to say that this is a serious upgrade for home theater fans. Although I wouldn't say this is an outstanding Blu-Ray film, I will say it is a solid one because it delights and pleases wherever possible. In that regard, it is worth the purchase.  In regards to the acting, Harrison Ford Fans or in my case die-hard Gary Oldman fans will be impressed here. A multi-talented and quite younger Gary Oldman emits a more vengeful and retrained type of villain here as opposed to some of the former impulsive, unbalanced psychotic characters he plays. His anger is explosive and expected when provoked and his calmness is professional when in control; he practically has zero empathy for anyone on board as he kills relentlessly with his crew. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, plays a very likeable president; his assertiveness and confidence in times of panic and danger will definitely satisfy his plausibility as an authority figure as well as a favorable president. Besides the main actors, Glenn Close ( The Vice president) along with William H. Macy and Wendy Crewson (the first lady) are serviceable to say the very least.  In conclusion, Air Force One will definitely please most fans of far-fetched action packed high explosive films while simultaneously satisfying the technical crowd who thoroughly enjoy seeing their films being treated in a careful and respectful manner.\t\n",

      "I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.  I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a \"Heather\" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....  I LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.  The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as \"Mr. Rochester\", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, \"Edward.\"  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.  If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.\t\n",

I have used other anti-oxidant products from very dependable sources, and there is just no dramatic difference I detect with this product. Freeze dried Acai appears to be the most dependable formulation for delivery of the benefits of the berry, but I honestly noticed no change after a month trial. (I actually had to stop taking this product for a few days as for some reason, perhaps attributed to the pH of the supplement, I found the product worsened my gastritis). I give the product three stars, because I do believe that for some people, they may see remarkable results, but I certainly did not. I still believe that this product is worth a try, for all the reasons that the Acai Berry has the potential to yield wonderful changes in overall health. It just did not do it for me. Good luck to those who choose to try this. I would recommend this brand because of the preference of the freeze dried state to hold onto all the nutritional \"miracles\". Don't get succored into cheaper brands. The nature of a complicated illness may or may not be a factor that determines clinical outcomes. Healthy supplement options are at times only as good as the Company that makes them. I do believe that the Acai Berry is a very important food souce. Besides the wonders of its potential health benefits, it is a product that ensures the preservation of the Amazon Jungles. On the flip-side, the less we eat hearts of palms which comes from the same tree and literally ensures the destruction of the tree to harvest the hearts, the better.\t\n",

      "This makes it super easy to winterize your system by yourself.  My shutoff valve box has a nipple for doing this, but it's something other than the typical compressor quick connect type fitting. Since I already have an outdoor faucet down in the garden that is part of the irrigation side of the shutoff valve, I can easily attach this adapter and use my compressor to blow out my sprinklers. Note that if you don't have a faucet on the sprinkler side, you can get parts at a hardware store to fit this adapter onto one of the sprinkler feeders itself, but you will need a way to force that valve open all the time during blow-out. This is not something most sprinkler controllers let you do.  Note that you do NOT want to use this on a regular outdoor faucet on the house side of the shutoff valve!  Steps to use this:  1. Shut off the main sprinkler valve. This is probably at the street near your meter. 2. Open the outdoor faucet and let as much water drain out by gravity as possible 3. Attach this adapter, and then attach the compressor to it 4. Start up the compressor and let it charge the tank. 5. One by one, go through and open each sprinkler zone valve and let it run until it's just blowing air 6. When you're done, close the faucet  Note that you will need a \"real\" compressor for this. My 1 gallon craftsman compressor has a hard time keeping the line at 20psi while doing this. Be careful to stop and let the compressor cool off every few minutes.\t\n",

      "BEFORE YOU UPGRADE:  stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments).  This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade.  It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches.  For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet!  I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.  Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make.  While the look and feel of Windows 8 is strikingly different, for the most part it boils down to one huge change:  the Start Menu that we have had since Windows 95 is no longer a menu.  Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths in a full-screen splash.  Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7:  rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for.  If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces.  This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.  UPDATE: Amazon customer Robert Haines says that there is a program called \"Classic UI\" that would restore the old look, so if you're dead-set on new code that skips the new UI, you might want to try that.  There is also a program called \"Pokki Menu\" that will let you make your own customizations and last, Stardock makes a (paid) program called \"Start8\" that will also roll back the Start screen.  The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different.  Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product.  Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet:  you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.  Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy.  Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7.  Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8.  Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 \"Aero effects\" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop).  Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar.  The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything.  My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.  For some features, time will tell.  I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time.  I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications.  The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to.  I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score).  The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel:  expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen.  If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS:  so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.  Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.  UPDATE, 11/2013:  Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, an update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better.  If you purchase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost.  The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8.  Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences.  I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason.  Sooo....if you go the Windows 8.1 route, there is then a Windows 8.1 \"Update for Windows 8.1\" that you should probably pull down that puts one more round of fixes into the OS.  Reviews so far have been positive--minor adjustments like putting the power button where it's easy to find and making interacting with the Tile UI have been needed...but surprisingly it also lowered the OS' system requirements to where it can run on as little as 1GB of RAM.\t\n",

      "I was a bit apprehensive when ordering this as prior reviews mentioned that it was too short for anyone close to 6' tall.  I had no issues using this when edging about 50' yesterday.  We have a sandy clay soil with bermuda.  That's a reasonably tough environment for an edger.  My prior edger started bending at the neck, so I retired it before it decided to break and injure me somehow.  This edger seems to feel substantially solid with the metal going up pretty far up the handle.  The round handle looks interesting.  In use, it is really easy to grip comfortably.  I may have to retire my d-handle shovels and try out these o-handles instead.  My old edger just had a long handle, and that often left blisters even after short use.  The o-handle seemed to make it easier as I was able the rock the edger back and forth with ease.  I had my hands in the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, and that seems to provide enough downward pressure and lateral stability.  I hope the manufacturer can find suitable manufacturing facilities outside of China.  With their corporate and government human rights record, you just never know how much blood and human sacrifice has gone into the end product.  This product is unique enough that I feel a bit of a premium for non-China manufacture would be worth the cost.  In addition, it's not uncommon to see the proprietary design \"leak\" to another China based manufacturer, and all of a sudden, cheap clones flood the market.  IP protection is not something that China is interested in.\t\n",

      "I purchased the Jensen Jet Falcon 10\" (8 ohm) speaker to see if I could upgrade the sound of my Fender Super Champ X2, which is a $350 hybrid tube/modeling amp.  The stock speaker in that amp is a Fender Special Design 10\", and it is by no means \"bad\" at low volumes, but I had story after story about people replacing it and being happy with the change.  However, it seems like the popular replacement speaker for that amp (and many American-voiced 10\" combos) is the Eminence Ragin' Cajun, a super-efficient, LOUD, behemoth with a gigantic ceramic magnet.  What I was looking for was a more nuanced improvement to the stock speaker in the SCX2.  I did want or need the additional volume to play at home, but a slightly fuller tone, less harsh treble, and increased resistance to breakup/rattling were important to me.  After months of research, enter the Jensen Jet Falcon 10\".  The Jet Series is Jensens effort to preserve elements of their classic vintage tones (Jensen speakers were typical of Fender amps in the 1960's), but providing a slightly modern twist with some additional low end response and warmer overall voicing.  This appeals to me also because I have a great love for guitar pedals, so my SCX2 may be asked to cop a Fender tone one day, and then belt out a gainy Marshall riff the next.  THE GOOD: Overall, I have to say that this is an excellent speaker.  If you already liked the tone of your Fender-style amplifier, the Jet Falcon is a fairly \"safe\" upgrade in terms of cost and staying true to the original tone of the amp.  Immediately upon installing this speaker, I noticed a fuller low end - not necessarily in the sub-bass frequencies, but in the lower mids.  I think this is a good thing unless your goal is to try and turn your Fender into a Mesa Boogie with a speaker change, which probably will not be successful.  Jensen also promotes the speaker as having a slightly rounded off high end, and I really like that aspect of it as a Strat & Tele player.  To be clear, the sparkling Fender high end is still there, but the high end is slightly warmer and more musical than the stock speaker.  The Jet Falcon also responds very well to gain - it was loving my overdrive and distortion pedals, and this will probably only improve as the speaker breaks in further.  Installation was a breeze - 4 screws in the exact same placement as my stock speaker and replaced the +/- connections by hand without having to modify anything.  It probably took 20 minutes (or less) to make the switch, and I have very little knowledge of how amps work.  THE BAD: As happy as I was with the tones I described above, one thing alarmed me a little bit and almost caused me to give the speaker a 4-star review...I believe it is quieter than the stock speaker.  Now, for me, this is arguably a positive thing.  Tube and hybrid amps have a better quality tone at moderate or high volumes than they due at insanely low settings.  But many who make the effort to replace the speaker in their amp are hoping for more power, which is why the Ragin' Cajun is so popular in this amp, and I could see them being disappointed with this speaker.  As it is with me, the SCX2 already had more volume than I reasonably could need, not to mention both a \"Line Out\" jack and an extension cabinet output jack, so the Jet Falcon remains plenty powerful for my needs.  Oh, and yes, the Jet Falcon does feature a magical green cone.  Worth mentioning since something like 95% of the speaker cones out there are some version of black or gray.  I think the color is cool and I can't see it through the grill of my amp anyway.  But buyer beware if cone color is a \"dealbreaker\" for you...  The Jensen Jet Falcon is reasonably priced and delivers on classic American-voiced tones, with perhaps just a bit warmth and low end response behind it.  Do not buy this speaker if you hate everything about your Fender or similar amplifier, or if your goal is to be as loud as possible.  Do consider this speaker if you are interested in an affordable quality replacement or upgrade for your 10\" combo or cabinet.\t\n",

      "I traded in an Epson WF-7620 to try this printer out. I ended up going back to the Epson. This Printer was a big disappointment. For the price I expected much more. The printer does not have a rear paper feed slot, big drawback. I was willing to live with this. But when I loaded a 6 3/4 size envelope and the printer did not have that paper size available, that's when I started to get frustrated. A plus to the printer is the hp support. It was difficult for me to locate the option for chat support on hp's website, but unfortunately I got very good at locating and using this. While the chat support was phenomenal (actually helped me figure out my scanning issue that made me get rid of the Epson WF-7620!) they could not help me with the envelope issue. the solution was to install a strange driver that then made it necessary to enter the paper size on my computer printer settings each time I changed paper size. not acceptable. Then I had unfixable issues with printing photo's from my computer without the printer adding a border. From AirPrint, photo's had no border, but I could not print a borderless photo from my PC, even after hours with chat support and weird drivers being installed that compromised other functions of the printer. They did get photo's to print without border from my PC with one driver, but then half of the photo was discolored, consistently.  Pro's: + hp's chat support + nice quality photo's and documents + double paper tray  Con's - no size 6 3/4 envelope paper option (but there is a Japanese postcard size??) - no rear paper feed slot - tray for printed items is awkward - white color  In the end, after much back and forth, hp issued me a full refund. (I was out the tax, and price of ink, however).  This might be a good printer for someone, I'm happy that at least through all of this, hp support helped me figure out that my printer/scanner needs to be within 15 feet of my Wi-Fi router in order to scan. Epson support never discovered this, had they I would have stayed with Epson. now, after a lot of headache with hp, I can use my Epson WF-7620, which has many more features for the same price. and it's black.\t\n",

      "I play bass and keyboards in a dance cover trio, and also sing backup. I was considering buying a wedge monitor to hear myself better, but after researching this and the other Rolls gadgets, along with the ART and Behringer ones, decided to buy this one. I'm thrilled that I did. Wasn't sure about the extra cost for the added line input, but thought it would come in handy for a click track or anything else I might want to do in the future. I got to try my setup at rehearsal and the results were awesome. I was able to sing my parts with so much more confidence and accuracy just from having my own voice right in my ear. I paired these up with a pair of MEElectronics M6-CL-MEE Sport Noise-Isolating In-Ear Headphones with Memory Wire (Clear) from Amazon for $20 (also VERY happy with those, highly recommend!)  In my setup I run my Sure SM58 into a TC Helicon doubler pedal and then into the PM351 (with a really short xlr jumper cable I also got on Amazon). From there it goes into the board. For rehearsal, I did not use a monitor send back into the PM351 but will try that at my next gig. I plug a mini-jack headphone extension cable into the PM351 and plug the in-ear monitors into the extension to give myself room to get funky. The ear buds have nice memory wire and run over the ears and down your back. They have a little clip that I clip on the back of my shirt collar. Wireless in-ear monitors are awesome on TV and for rock stars, but after careful consideration, I realized that 90% of my gigs have stages so small that I barely get to giggle around much at all. Having a thin cable running to the PM351 is no worse than my bass guitar's cable. And they both run to my pedal board in front of me so it's not a hassle at all. I have all my effects velcro'd down on my pedal board for ease of set up. (It will also run on 9 volts from my One Spot)  The PM351 is very load and I had to turn it way down. I also only used one ear bud since we don't mic everything in rehearsal. Just having my own voice in my one ear at just the right volume was a huge help with my singing and i know the gigs will be that much better just from that. The TC Helicon (I love!) helps thicken up my backup vocals and sometimes I use the Octave Up setting that can be hard to sing with without hearing yourself clearly. With this setup I can nail the right note and octave and hear exactly what is coming out of the TC Helicon. This is all WAY better and cheaper than lugging around a wedge monitor. Our drummer is also going to get the exact same setup I have! Highly recommend!\t\n",

      "I bought this game primarily for the tennis and I'm not disappointed.  Hands down it is the best tennis simulator available.  I have played Virtua Tennis 4, Grand Slam 2 and Top Spin 4 and the Sports Champions 2 tennis beats them all as a simulator, easily. To be clear, if you're looking for iconic courts, famous players and controller play then this is NOT the game for you.  But if you want to simulate tennis in your living room and play challenging games with genuine tennis shots then look no further. Top spin, lobs, slices, passing shots . . . they're all here and are performed with the Move controller exactly as if you were holding a tennis racket.  It is scary realistic play.  And challenging too.  The game accommodates all skill levels and keeps it just challenging enough to keep you interested.  As you progress through the game the opponents get tougher until you feel you're up against Serena or Rafa.  I am now playing a system opponent who never faults, reaches every cross-court shot and hits with full power!  Challenging.  This game has me sweating in minutes.  Best thing is it rewards you for improving your skill and stamina. Buy it if you want to play real tennis.  If you want button clicks and joystick action buy the others.\t\n",

      "****UPDATE****UPDATE**** So I just ordered my second batch of these. Since my first order, I thought I'd try some other brands from local stores. I'm hear to tell you - don't bother - they're disgusting! I purchased a ready-made and a powder you stir with hot water. They literally smelled like dried carcass. They smelled and tasted like an animal - gross gross gross. This Kitchen Basics brand is far superior. Tastes like regular broth and the price is way cheaper than what I paid in stores. This is my forever brand - done shopping around. ******MY FIRST REVIEW BELOW****** Heard about bone broth powder but I'm not a huge smoothie drinker. I'm trying to cut down on my sugars, even natural ones from fruit, yogurt and health bars.  I'll have a couple of hard-boiled eggs for lunch with a warm cup of this bone broth and it will keep my satiated for some time. I love the convenience of pouring this in a coffee cup and warming it up in the microwave for a minute. It's thicker than regular broth but don't think \"thick\" like it sounds - it's more dense. Where you can see the bottom of your cup with regular broth, you can't see it with this bone broth. So it's a bit heartier but not as salty which I like. In comparing the ingredients of this brand with others, I found this to be the most natural of the bone broths I researched, with less sodium as well.  The smell is a bit off-putting for me but I enjoy the taste so it's a win. I also read that bone broth has healing properties. I am on a probiotic daily but noticed after the first 3 days of starting this, I had the runs so it's possible that's true. I have since felt great.\t\n",

      "I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.  1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.  2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to \"try it out\", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.  3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for \"jumping the gun\" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't. Had we not purchased the seasons when they were initially offered, further releases would have been concelled in any event.\t\n",

      "This is a very nice high quality leather belt for the Ken Onion Work Sharp.  It was very nicely packed and even came with some white compound along with very detailed instructions for proper installation, use, and maintenance of the belt.  Because leather stretches, the belt is purposely made short to allow for that stretching over time.  The belt will probably need to be stretched a little before the first installation to get it to fit easier onto the Work Sharp, and the instructions mention this.  Also, you may need to adjust the belt tracking on the Work Sharp to get this belt to track straight.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase but only time will tell if the product lasts.  UPDATE:  I didn't think that this additional information would be necessary, but since there are a few individuals who have very dangerously improperly used the belt in their machines, here are a few VERY IMPORTANT things people should know if they don't already:  1.  You must stretch the belt in order to get it to fit prior to first use.  If you don't know the reasoning, read the instructions that come with the belt. 2.  This leather belt is NOT intended to be used with the guide attachment that comes with the Work Sharp.  It is intended to be used free-hand as if you were using a standard belt sander.  After installing the leather belt, leave the guides off.  If you don't know how to hone/strop knives free-hand with a belt sander, please do some research with your favorite web browser and on Youtube. 3.  NEVER use the leather belt with the belt moving in the opposite direction that the knife edge is pointing.  Some people claim to do it but it is a safety hazard and there simply is no need to.  Common sense should tell you that the knife edge will bite and cut into the leather, potentially flinging the knife who knows where.  Orient the Work Sharp so that it is facing you, and with the knife edge pointing DOWN, strop ONLY with the side of the belt that is also TRACKING DOWNWARD.  To work the other side of the knife, turn the knife around to the other side (not upside down!).  The edge of the knife should still be pointing DOWN in the same direction that the belt is tracking. 4.  If you are still unclear about how to use the leather belt, find the Youtube video titled \"BEST WAY to Sharpen Any Knife RAZOR SHARP!\".  The leather belt portion starts at about the 5 minute mark.  These are my opinions and are not intended to be regarded as fact.  I have no affiliation with the makers of this leather belt nor the link posted above.  I paid full price when it was first released.  But since my review is near the top of the list, I felt it was my responsibility to include additional information that may help prevent a visit to the ER or even the morgue.\t\n",

      "First, I would like to request to this author's editors that all books must be at least 1200 pages long.  Yes, I know, that's a lot, but it's never enough.  The fantastic characters.  The brilliant storylines.  The edge of your seat nail biting while clenching your teeth suspense at what is to transpire.  The laugh out loud dialogue and characters.  Woke my poor hubby up laughing while he was trying to sleep.  At the end of this book you will freak out at the idea of where this could possibly lead.  So many possibilities.  Totally unpredictable plot.  I hope the next book happens soon.  I can't disclose too much because of spoilers.  Just know there is so much going on in this book.  The set up for the continuation of the storyline is really the entire book.  I am going to have to go into therapy to deal with the waiting for the next book.  Brilliant!\t\n",

      "I absolutely love this game!  The cityscapes are so full of detail you feel completely immersed in this game.  I just can't believe the amount of detail that is included!  Graphics are out of this world.  Great game play.  I'm a big fan of the sneaking around genre.  Great character development and story.  You really make a connection with the characters.  All the cut scenes are top notch.  I never get bored playing this game, it feels new and fresh every time I play.  The only negative... well technically I don't consider it a negative since I'm giving this game 5 stars, is that this game is so immersive that it physically stresses me out to play it sometimes.  (mainly with some of the \"clicker\" areas)  I have never had a game stress me out as much as this one.  I literally had to stop playing a few times because it gave me a headache it was so intense.  The only other thing to mention is that it is very hard core, raw and bloody.  Not really a game for young impressionable kids.  *Update 1: Just finished the game.  This game was amazing!  I highly recommend it to anyone who has not played it to get it ASAP!  I can't wait to dive into the side story \"Left Behind\" that comes with this.  **Update 2: Just finished the side story \"Left Behind\".  This was an excellent little bonus.  The entire thing was pretty short and had some very long cut scenes but it also had some of the funnest stealth killing missions in the entire game.  Very fun little add on.  I really hope they decide to continue this game with more DLC or a part 2 to it.\t\n",

      "I'm sure this game has been reviewed to death already, lol, but since I just played it recently, I thought I'd add mine to the mix. Anyway, this game was amazing. Technically, there weren't necessarily any real upgrades from Far Cry 3 as far as gameplay and such goes, although the graphics were definitely even more amazing. I'd actually say this is possibly the best looking gen 8 game yet.  So, speaking of gameplay....it was as engaging and fun as ever. Really, I could run and drive around Kyrat all day every day and never be disappointed. There is a ton of stuff to do, plenty of objects to find, all of which carrying their own piece of a few different stories. The flight suit was also super cool.  Troy Baker as Pagan Min was inspired. I don't know that anybody could ever top Vaas as a video game villain, but Pagan Min was right up there, and Baker played the role to perfection. There were quite a few interesting characters in the game, but Min really stole the show.  As always, your moral choices tend to be more of the best of the worst type things. You won't really feel great about either story arc at times (there are basically two, much like with FC3). Neither really represents a \"good guy\" type scenario. Lesser of two evils kind of deal here. That said, there is a little leeway. In my playthrough, where possible, I let people live. Sometimes, that doesnt even work out well, lol.  Anyway, the story was pretty engaging IMO. It won't win any prizes necessarily, but it does keep you interested and wanting more.  Did I mention the elephants? Holy ##### the elephants! They are complete bad ###es, and you will defintiely want to take full advantage of your ability to ride one into an enemy outpost and wreak havoc. In fact, the first outpost I attacked, they had an elephant penned. I shot the elephant in the behind with an arrow from afar, and it basically went beserk and took care of the entire outpost for me while I watched the whole thing through my binoculars, lol.  Did I mention the Rhinos? F### the rhinos. They are also bad ###es, and they don't really discriminate, lol. Everybody in the area is a potential target for their ill temper and rage. They are also incredibly resilient. You will waste a ton of bullets trying to take one down. Also, once they figure out that you are the one shooting at them, they definitely don't hesitate to let you know just how little they appreciated that treatment. At one point, I literally just fired a grenade launcher at an enemy courier when a rhino came out of nowhere and smashed the courier. Just then, a rebel truck and an enemy truck both rolled in and everything started attacking everythign. As I watched in amazement, and eagle swooped in and attacked me. After I fought off the eagle, looked over and gazed upon the smoking ruins that was several vehicles and a bunch of once living people, with a rhino sauntering off looking pleased with itself, I thought \"You know, this is what Far Cry is all about right here\".  btw....eagles....by far the most annoying and vicious creatures in a game that also features honey badger, rhinos, elephants, and so on. They move fast, they can come from any direction, are huge and can carry off smaller prey (like goats...which you will see happen), and view everything as prey. F### those eagles, lol.  I'm sure you can tell from reading all of this that there is a lot of content and a lot of randomness in this game, which really adds to the experience. This is a living and breathing game world, and it doesnt stop just because the prodigal son (you) sees fit to wander through it.  I cant recommend this game enough. Buy it, play it, love it!\t\n",

      "It's easy to understand why Air Force One was such a big hit. The President saves the country. America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from evil again. Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fueled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President at the time.  But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps. If this were made today it would be PG-13 garbage, but the blood spatters, swearing and body count make you believe that ANY character could die next.  But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.  If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.  And try to spot three villains from Beverly Hills Cop 2 and one villain from Beverly Hills Cop 3. They're all here.\t\n",

      "An absolute must have for most PS4 owners. (Unless you are an angry gamer)  Like From Software's Dark Souls and Demon's Souls games... Bloodborne will test your mettle by killing you over and over and over. That is until you learn the monsters, areas and bosses in order to triumph. The action is similar to the Souls games. And if you're unfamiliar with those... A. SHAME ON YOU. B. Prepare to dungeon crawl, fight incredibly difficult bosses, and die... A LOT! You'll get a main weapon and a gun in which to perform a type of parry with and have a ranged attack at your disposal. The limited weapon selection is a nice change of pace from Software's other games and allows you to play with the weapon you are most comfortable with. (Kind of like Monster Hunter games) You'll be able to do some customization to your weapon of choice through the use of socketed gems, which in turn can change stats or add elemental attributes to your weapon. The only downside and Achielles heel was the lack of shield. Since I played the Souls Games in a very tanky, slow and steady, nothing should break my defenses manner... it was a slap in the face trying to adjust to the more acrobatic, split second dodge maneuvers that Bloodborne requires. YMMV. The visuals and details in this game is astounding. It was my first game for the PS4 and I am deeply impressed with the capabilities that the PS4 has based on play Bloodborne. Nothing more satisfying that running around, smoting townsfolk of Yarhnam with my kirkhammer and getting completely blood soaked until I myself die. The sound is stellar and the sound track is even better. (It is available for purchase from the PS store too!) The story will leave you scratching your head. But it's more about the action and exploration than really uncovering any meaningful story. And of course there is the NewGame+ feature which will bring some replay value to your $60 purchase. Expect an expansion through DLC later on down the line to revive the game even if you've beaten it several times. And there is always the ability to play new ways by making a new character and customizing them differently. Worth every penny if you want a game that will keep you busy and shouting obscenities!!\t\n",

Japanese Spider crabs can be found at depths between 90 and 6,000 meters. Learn about the Ocean's Sunfish known as the heaviest fish on earth. Learn about the coral dwellers such as the nudibranch and where they survive. Learn about the Nautilus (not the submarine that Captain Nemo had) but the animal for which the submarine was named). Learn about the Sperm whale what is it predator, what does it eat and how does it live? Learn about the very dangerous Moray Eel where they spend their time and how they catch prey. Find out about Jelly fish, why are they so dangerous? Which kinds are dangerous? What are jelly fish made of? Learn about the fish that can camoflauge themselves in the sand such as the Stargazers. learn what these funny fish eat and how they survive.  My grandson is in 3rd grade and this book would be awesome for him. I believe this book should be a part of his extensive library. Something that should be a great read for him. He reads way above his age as he grows so does his knowledge of the world as did his mother at his age. Reading invokes imagination, knowledge from a foundational status. Reading makes the brain work where television arrests the brain function by not making any one think.

      "Awesome. I use it with both ANT+ transmitters running on Android tablet and also as a bluetooth smart device. The connection has never failed. I own 30 units of this and use it during my physical education classes. The Scosche Rhythm + is both ANT+ and Bluetooth smart enabled.  Readings are comparable with a chest worn HRM. I tested it versus the Polar H7 Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitor. It's also sweat resistant, good enough for the hardest of land based workouts. I once accidentally threw a unit into the washing machine for a hour's wash followed by 90 minutes spin in the dryer. Still works! Don't try it at home!  Presently, I use it regularly as a test unit for GPS watches and wearables. The Scosche Rhythm + features technology from Performancetrek. Just google that and have a read at what you're buying into.  It lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge and takes about 45 minutes to an hour for a full charge. Going by individual usage, it takes about a week to deplete the charge based on an hour of usage per day.  It comes packed with a USB charger and 2 neoprene velcro bands; a small and a large.  You can't go wrong with this. I've reviewed many products, main fitness tech and all, and this is high on my list of items you must buy.\t\n",

It just made it taste better.  Would I buy and recommend it: Heck to the yes!  Even recommend the mung bean pasta this company makes if you want a strong meaty texture (great for vegans).']"

       " \"So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it won't happen to you?  It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.  That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.  Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.\",\n",
       " \"What a FAB-u-LOUS mini sewing kit! This is the first kit that I have come across that has any color thread that could be needed! There is a total of 32 mini spools as well as 32 bobbins. The mini spools have a great amount of thread in them, I was really surprised! What I thoifjt it was is those little cardboard rolls that are included in  most other kits,  however this is much larger than I expected! All of your basic colors are included as well as some neonish colors as well multiple color variations of the same color. Its really nice to have all these colors in one pack! If you can't tell in impressed!  I love that this EBeauty Sewing kit doeant throw in all kinds of unnecessary items just to fill space. What you need is what you get. What you get is quality here! The wheel that includes the needles is not made of cheap plastic that cracks when the fastener tape is pulled off and the scissors actually cut!! You get 30 different needled with different sized heads. You get 2 plastic thimbles as well as 2 threaders and a measuring tape that measures up to 25 inches on one side and 64 centimeters on the other. This tape is of quality as well, this is not one of those tapes that has the little threads coming out all over just waitimg to unravel . its a good tape! This all takes this kit to a whoping 100 pieces!! Each piece sits nicely into a plastic tray. The tray sits nicely into my sewing box and keeps all items in their places!  All in all this is an excellent option of a mini sewing kit! This would be great for a beginner as well as for making a travel kit or even to have the options that yjis kit offers for your daily needs as they arise, this kit would get the job done!  Highly recommend!\",\n",
       " \"I installed one of these heaters in my chinese 24 H.P. diesel tractor. (a very old and cold blooded design)  It worked great last year, for the 2 times I used it. I wrote a glowing review on the tractor site I belong to.  A made in USA product at a competitive price, that is a win win product!  This year it don't work.  I pulled it out and did some ohm meter tests on it.  The thermostat is fine but the heating element is not.  Zero contuctivity through the heating element.  Now I have a gap in my radiator hose that I have to fill so I have ordered another one.  I would hope that something built in the USA would function a little better than this.  I was very pleased with it when I installed it and it worked well.  I am not quite so pleased now.  It is reasonably priced and it should work for a long time.  There isn't much to it.  Perhaps the bend radius of the heating element is a little sharper than it can tolorate?  They work great when they work.  When they don't it sucks.  It is a real PITA when you have a snowstorm bearing down on you and can't get your tractor to start. I hope my dipstick heater is up to the task.  If the replacement heater lasts more than 2 uses I will ammend my evaluation.  It shouldn't be that difficult to build one of these.  About 3 inches of mild steel tubing a cal rod element and a couple of crimp on connections and a snap switch and 6 foot of electric cord.  The packaging probably costs more than the working parts.  12 five star reviews and 5 one star reviews would seem to indicate a serious problem with this product.  My second one seems to work well.  I just should have not had to buy a second one.  Perhaps the manufacturer of this product has corrected the problem.  Bend radius of the Cal rod element? Something?  We need this and you build it.  Tell us you fixed it, how and why.  You will sell a lot more when they all work for more than 2 start ups.  I will be your most vocal fan.  It is the season....\",\n",
       " 'KILROY WAS HERE...  The album has toiled under the weight of its results. The band, which had irreparably fractured 4 years earlier, fell apart \"with one finger up in the air.\" Intractable as the feelings were then, the legacy has remained as staunchly overwrought. The end result is that the greatness of this album actually being less than the sum of its parts.  KILROY WAS HERE was not actually the album that destroyed the band. CORNERSTONE owns that dubious distinction for it was the first album in which the band wrote songs and arranged them as the writers deemed fit. It was the first album in which all band members did not assist in the creation and arrangement of the songs. To a large degree Cornerstone became the first in a devolving process where in STYX fell from being a band to being a collection of 5 remarkably talented musicians performing as solo artists under the bands name. KLIROY WAS HERE was the climax (or anti-climax if you wish) of that disintegration of the once incredible band STYX.  KILROY WAS HERE might have been a truly great album if Dennis DeYoung would have released it as a solo album or even under a pseudonym. There are several incredibly wonderful songs on this album, JUST GET THROUGH THIS NIGHT and HAVEN\\'T WE BEEN HERE BEFORE stand the test of time as being among the most beautiful and soulful of STYX songs to have ever graced a disc. COLD WAR and DON\\'T LET IT END could have found themselves on any STYX album and not have been out of place (albeit with some better cohesiveness among band members in the arrangements.) I would argue that the guitar work and vocals are better than on most of the tracks on PARADISE THEATRE.  A few of the songs are just silly. While the concept was valiant, the remainder of the band was not heartfelt in their support and it showed in the lack of creativity and instrumentation throughout the individual tracks. Very little of Dennis DeYoungs\\' or James Youngs\\' songs seemed unique or complex in their structuring or instrumentation (not unlike some of the tracks from CORNERSTONE.)  During STYX halcyon days, each of the bands five members contributed more than their two cents worth as they chiseled out the songs. This method was brought back during the recording of the brilliant CYCLORAMA album. However, a prolonged rhythm bridge was never introduced or a chorus from a previously penned song was never suggested, let alone melded into the final master tape which was released as KILROY WAS HERE.  STYX was known for such an ethereal harmony, played with incredible meticulousness, that was almost unmatched within the annals of rock and roll. Not even YES (while instrumentally superior) could match the soulfulness of the songwriting and vocal talents of STYX. STYX was a band of such mesmerizing sound and unity that Jack Black (who holds the band in unmatched reverence) once stated that it would be impossible for him to imagine playing with because of the sound being \"too magical.\" But, as the band broke apart, the songs suffered.  KILROY WAS HERE, as an album, suffered the most. Had Dennis DeYoung wrote and recorded the album as a solo project, who knows how history might have remembered the album? Had Tommy and the band continued, who can argue that STYX would have regained its lost magic? The album became a microcosm of the band itself... immense talent, incredible potential, all lost under the weight of self-centered, egotistical and misguided totalitarianism imposed upon a rebellious minded population that surrendered to the control of the despot and ultimately imploded. We can only thank Johnathan Chance for standing up against the tyranny and fueling the opportunity for the band members to escape, with the footsteps ultimately leading down to the re-structured STYX of today.  And lest we never forget, if the songs were as bad as some would like to remember, the strong minded band members would have protested sufficiently to have insured that the songs would not have been recorded. JY, Chuck, John and even Tommy found enough to add their contributions without too much protest (let alone firing Dennis DeYoung). And STYX today does offer snippets of plaudits to the album every now and then within their concerts and even their studio recordings. [Tommy Shaw had a picture of a ROBOTO mask within the liner notes of his heralded 1998 solo album 7 DEADLY ZENS, and STYX included numerous samples from KILROY WAS HERE within the 1999 BRAVE NEW WORLD album.)  In summation, KILROY WAS HERE, albeit much maligned (and deservedly so) is still a great album filled with great songs performed by great musicians... KILROY WAS HERE, however, cannot be regarded as a great STYX album, as the band was torn asunder as far back as 1979. KILROY WAS HERE was an evolution of that disintegration... it was a paradoxical release of a band that was no more.',\n",
       " 'Don McLean had the great good fortune and the nagging misfortune of having a thumping big hit early in his career.  Having one of his songs become a cultural phenomenon guaranteed him sellout concerts as it hung a big medallion around his neck that read \"American Pie Guy\".  McLean had more to offer than that epic pop music history  clef.  This handy compilation offers a listener a taste of McLean\\'s more substantial work sprinkled among the obligatory love songs and covers.  Before American Pie made him famous, McLean wrote biting social commentary in songs such as Respectable.  His first single after American Pie -- Vincent -- showed him as moodily reflective.  Following that, Dreidel had a deceptively upbeat pop arrangement which made the lyrics seem more bland than they are:  No days you can borrow, no time you can buy. No trust in tomorrow. It\\'s a lie. And I feel like I\\'m dippin\\' and divin\\'. My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels. I\\'m lost in this star car I\\'m drivin\\'. But my air sole keeps pushin\\' big wheels. My world is a constant confusion. My mind is prepared to attack. My past a persuasive illusion. I\\'m watchin\\' the future it\\'s black.  This is not Don\\'t Worry, Be Happy time, but those are feelings most of us can identify with.  Another contrasting treatment is Wonderful Baby, which seems like an amusing cutesy-cuddly whimsy, until you listen:  Wonderful baby nothin\\' but new, the world has gone crazy, I\\'m glad I\\'m not you. At the beginning or is it the end? It goes in and comes out and starts over again.  Get that \"I\\'m glad I\\'m not you.\"  Not even Bob Dylan could make a pop music career out of trenchant observations, so McLean served up his share of musings on romance, but even there things weren\\'t always perky, as Castles in the Air ended up with Empty Chairs.  McLean had to do a cover of a song by his boyhood idol Buddy Holly (Everyday) to inject an optimistic note.  When he turned out isn\\'t-love-a-delight efforts (La La I Love You, And I Love You So, If We Try, Going for the Gold) he sounded like John Denver at too high an altitude, or Gordon Lightfoot in one of his wince - inducing sensitive modes, and those are the weakest songs here.  As McLean released songs about the problematic prospects of life, his pop music chart performance kept drifting down, but he found a niche on Adult Contemporary playlists.  His albums performed similarly; by the early 80s, he was seen as a relic of the decade that started with Crosby, Stills and Nash and ended with disco, which tells us something about changes in popular taste.  McLean\\'s last album to crack the Billboard Top 40, released as the 70s wound down, had less bite than his early efforts: there were four covers of conventional material, one of which, a gorgeous version of the Roy Orbison/Joe Melson song Crying, gave him his last Top Ten hit, almost ten years after American Pie.  And so he drifted into cult status.  There isn\\'t any indication that the tracks on this release were remastered for this collection.  The sound is fine -- full and clear.  The order of the tracks on this compilation pays no attention to chronological order, and the booklet notes don\\'t lay this out clearly, which gives this album a sense of being an organic work, rather than a compilation.  This not a bad idea, but it waves away the reality that an artist\\'s works reflect the artist\\'s interests and skills at various times in life.  (Imagine a Bob Dylan hits collection with Gotta Serve Somebody as the next track after Like a Rolling Stone.  Yep, that\\'s two Dylan references.)  So, for those who would like a handy librarian\\'s guide, here are the albums in chronological order with their respective tracks and track numbers on this compilation:  Tapestry (1970)  Castles in the Air  2 And I Love You So  13 Respectable  18  American Pie (1971)  American Pie  1 Winterwood  4 Sister Fatima  6 Empty Chairs  7 Vincent  11 Crossroads  12 The Grave  17  Don McLean (1972)  Dreidel  3 The Birthday Song  8 If We Try  15  Playin\\' Favorites (1973)  Everyday  5 Fools Paradise  14 Mountains of Mourne  16  Homeless Brother (1974)  Wonderful Baby  9 La La Love You  10  Chain Lightning (1978)  Crying  20  Love Tracks (1987)  Going for the Gold  19',\n",
       " 'Okay before I review this DVD, I just want to clarify why I said this is for fans of Al Di Meola only. The songs he performs are not the same kind of \"fusion\" flare that you, the casual listener, are going to be accustomed to. He was a jazz fusion pioneer, sure, but things have changed since then. He\\'s more into the classical side of arranging and playing now.  Having said that, his playing on this DVD is amazing. The sound quality and video are also good. The band he\\'s playing with are all very well-versed musicians. The pianist he\\'s playing with, I think he\\'s name is Mario Parmisano, suprised me greatly. Al wouldn\\'t be playing with a musician that isn\\'t fantastic, so hats off to Al for his choice in musicians. Very strong rhythmic presence throughout.  As to comment on something a reviewer said in the review prior to mine, he mentioned how he was disappointed that Al Di Meola didn\\'t talk to the audience more. Look, I think I can say wholeheartedly that you DON\\'T want Al Di Meola talking to the audience! Trust me folks, you couldn\\'t bare it. Not only does he seem a bit stand-offish, but I honestly don\\'t think he would know what to say other than something weird.  No offense to Al, but I don\\'t want hear him talk. I want to hear him play, and that\\'s the reason I purchased this DVD. To me, it\\'s good enough to actually have something of him playing on DVD. If he doesn\\'t talk or if he does really shouldn\\'t be a valid complaint anyway. The review of any concert DVD should be a review of what it is, not what it could be.  This DVD is worth every penny, and fans of Al Di Meola are going to especially like this.',\n",
       " 'I so agree with the last reviewer!  As to another reviewer\\'s dissertation on what constitues a \"Mozart singer\", hogwash!  Montserrat Caballe failing to understand at every moment that she is singing Mozart?  Hogwash!  A \\'Mozart singer\\' is like every other \\'singer\\' - you got it or you ain\\'t; the rest is intellectual preening and has nothing to do with genuine operatic art. And what singing this is - a Cosi to treasure!  Mozart\\'s ensemble writing in this opera surpasses that of his other operas, and Baker, Cotrubas and Caballe find an emotional perfection in the rendering that alters the earth\\'s orbit!  I\\'ve not heard another Cosi like it since Cotrubas\\' earlier recording with von Stade and Stratas.  I also have the Harmonia Mundi recording and find it mundane by comparison.  Veronique Gens has fioriture up her sleeve; she can pull it out, but she sings with the emotional depth of a teenager.  Hers is a vocal aesthetic for Lully or Rameau, but not Bach, and certainly Mozart suggests that more consolidation of resources is necessary.  Why not hire David Bowie for the role?  -might as well.  What is more \\'stylish\\' than the musicianship these peerless singers and musicians bring to this surpassing Cosi?  Please not Rene Jacobs\\' arcane treatment of the score, though I do admire the Cologne orchestra, particularly the weight of the strings, but that too cerebral \\'informed classicism\\' always sticks its little notebook up into the musical air.  Colin Davis rivals his own Tosca (also with Caballe) in this recording.  The Covent Garden forces shine under his watch, even more, they consistently reach into themselves and deep into Mozart, deep into the opera - an attribute I would not ordinarily ascribe to this opera orchestra and chorus.  Nicolai Gedda will probably die still insufficiently revered, he is one of the supreme artists of our time, or any time; he is as desirable an actor as he is miraculous singer.  Even now, as things fall apart, he remains the present heart of any opera ensemble.  His artistry burnishes this recording to a glow.  Get this recording - it really has no rival at present.',\n",
       " 'These lenses are small but they do great job in adding effects to my photos and videos. See attached pictures. The picture on the top was taken without the lenses. The bottom pictures are with the addition of the Aukey lenses. These Aukey lenses work great with my iPhone and with the included clips, taking photo/video with these lenses is a breeze.  The wide-angle fisheye lens is great for capturing \"selfies\" and creating viaual effects by rounding the view of the sorroundings. As you can see, the center of the image did not come out distorted with the use of the fisheye lens. The overall view is still very clear but it creates this wonderful full-screen image.  The other lens, the 20X macro lens is very good for magnifying small objects and bringing them to full view using just an iPhone without any distortion. The lens is small but is very powerful. Please see the flower (bottom picture is the one taken using the 20X macro lens).  I remember having to pay $100 for each set of fisheye or macro lens for my Canon Rebel Ti Digital SLR camera. The DSLR camera and lenses are both heavy and bulky. It\\'s also very inconvenient to carry the big SLR camera and lenses on a regular basis.  Whereas with these Aukey lenses, you can store and carry them securely in a very nice and small case all the time.

However, I was not able to get the hardware to detect using Windows 8.1 Professional 64-Bit version. I was also unable to get the software to load AT ALL on Windows 7.0 using XP compatibility mode, so I will assume that this hardware does not work with Windows XP, either. Oddly, the software does mention supporting Windows VISTA. Go figure.  Unlike some reviewers here, I had no problem getting the connector to \"fit\" with the radio. Everything seemed to fit snugly. The USB end of the cable is a tad large though, so I wouldn\\'t plan on plugging any other USB devices right next to it. I\\'m not quite sure why the USB end of the connector is so large. It seems like a poor design.  Much like it\\'s radios, this Baofeng/Pofung patch cable is rather cheap. It does exactly what it is supposed to do though and for $7 (approx current price) you really don\\'t have much to lose. It isn\\'t something that you will likely use on a regular basis, so wear and tear on the cable should be minimal. Baofeng has always been know for their incredibly cheap two-way radios.

       " '\"24 Karat Gold ~ Songs From the Vault\" is a newly recorded album by Stevie Nicks, however if you didn\\'t know better you would easily think this was a long lost album from Stevie. Going back to 2010 when Stevie was working on her \"In Your Dreams\" album she discovered one her lost demos, \"Secret Love\", on YouTube. She reworked that track for that album. Jump ahead a few years and she discovered lots more of her lost demos on YouTube and with a few weeks this past spring, she and producer Dave Stewart headed down to Nashville to rework these tracks.  As a long time fan, I\\'ve had these demos in my collection for years, when I heard what her plan was, I was skeptical. This isn\\'t the first time she\\'s reworked old demos, but the results haven\\'t always been great. Listen to her original demo for \"Smile At You\", then check out the watered down released version on Fleetwood Mac\\'s \"Say You Will\". Would she be able to recapture the magic in these original demos, or would the suffer the same fate of \"Smile At You\" where too much time has passed and the inspiration behind the song is long forgotten. Another concern was her voice, it\\'s aged a lot since the recording of the demos. The answer is not only do these songs come to life, but in nearly every case, outshine the demos.   Among the highlights, the album kicks off with \"Starshine\", this is a fun rocker that is a great album opener and would also be a killer opening song on stage. If you\\'re familiar with the demo, you\\'ll hear how she really recaptured the feel of 1980 and the recording of the \"Bella Donna\" album right down to the organ solo.  \"Mabel Normand\" is one of her more rare demos, the song tells the tale of the long forgotten actress but here Stevie compares her own life to that of Mabel. The song dates back to the \"Rock A Little\" era and like \"Thousand Days\" or \"Mirror Mirror\" it has an almost rambling feel to the lyric, that\\'s not a bad thing.  The album\\'s title \"24 Karat Gold\" was a demo that I could never quite get into, the version here though shines. From the opening lone bass riff, which rolls into a drum beat, the song just comes to life.  One of my favorites from the album, \"Belle Fleur\" is another of the demos that I never got into, but once again, Stevie has transformed the song into a gem. The first minute of the song here is just a chugging drum beat that hooks you just before the song has it\\'s proper start. I also like the banjo heard throughout the song.  \"All The Beautiful Worlds\" is a great song period. It\\'s got a haunting tone that has a very definite late 70\\'s/early 80\\'s feel to it. Again here Stevie\\'s vocals sound as strong and vibrant as they did in the 80\\'s. With Sharon and Lori providing their background vocals, the song is classic Stevie.  \"Lady\" was known for years among fans as \"Knocking On Doors\". Stevie wrote this back in the late 60\\'s when she and Lindsey were trying to get noticed. Her voice has aged to perfection here. Just Stevie and a piano, that\\'s all this song needs.  With \"I Don\\'t Care\" Stevie rocks out. The music track was written by Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell and Waddy Wachtel. It\\'s got a swampy bluesy feel, a very different sound for Stevie. Stevie has said the end of the song lyrically was made up on the spot, honestly the whole song lyrically sounds improvised, but it works.  \"Watch Chain\" written about Mick Fleetwood in the late 70\\'s has retained much of the feel of the original demo. I\\'ve always liked this one and yet again, Stevie\\'s vocals have somehow transported back to the 70\\'s.  \"Hard Advice\" is the sister song to 2001\\'s \"That Made Me Stronger\", two songs written about the same conversation. In this case a conversation Stevie had with Tom Petty. This is a beautiful track.  \"Carousel\" is a Vanessa Carlton song that Stevie did not write, however it\\'s included here because it was one of Stevie\\'s late mother\\'s favorites.  \"Blue Water\" is something of holy grail song among fans, written by Stevie with Sharon Celani back in the late 70\\'s. I never cared for the demo, but once again the song has come alive here. She\\'s helped out on this one with Lady Antebellum.  \"Cathouse Blues\" was always something of a oddball among Stevie\\'s demos. As with \"I Don\\'t Care\" Stevie musically is trading new ground here, the song is given a jazzy treatment along with dixieland horns. Yes, it works.  \"The Dealer\" has long been one of my favorites, one can assume it was one of Stevie\\'s favorites as well, as she has recorded several demos of this. This version is slowed down a bit from the 1970\\'s demo, and some of the excitement from the original demo is missing. However if you\\'ve never heard the demo, then there is much to like here.  Closing out the album is \"She Loves Him Still\", another track she\\'s attempted a few times. Some don\\'t like the woodwind on this, I think it fits the song. Years have passed since she wrote this and she has moved on from whatever inspired her, but yet she sings it as if it was inspired just yesterday.   Stevie said recently that she couldn\\'t write these songs today. She\\'s right, she\\'s moved on and grown since these songs were written, in some ways these are really very simple songs. In every way though these are classic Stevie songs. This is very much the most pure Stevie album we\\'ve ever gotten.  Many of these songs probably wouldn\\'t have been hits during the time they were written and that\\'s probably why they were left behind. Looking back on these songs now, the heartbreak that inspired them has healed and now the songs are allowed to shine.  In some ways this doesn\\'t feel like a new album at all, it seems almost like a greatest hits album. At the same time it IS a new album filled with classic Stevie moments.',\n",

       " 'I\\'d heard about this on triple D and a few other places, and thought, \"Well, if they\\'re ranting THIS MUCH, it must be GREAT.\" Nah.  Used it on chicken TWICE (the reviews I\\'d read slobbered all over how good it was supposed to be with chicken), and it SUCKED. Not that it was nauseating, it just had no flavor at all. We have a pretty broad palate--like all kinds of foods--but this had  no real flavor profile at all. I\\'ve read it described as \\'lemony\\', etc.: don\\'t you believe it. I loaded the food up with lemon and this stuff, and it pretty much...just lay there.  Frankly: we grew up poor and couldn\\'t afford too many spices or extras, and my mom\\'s roast chicken with JUST salt, pepper and butter rocked WAAAAAAAAY more than this. Save your money is my instinct. I still plan to try it mixed with some other herbs, so I\\'ll update, and hopefully find a recipe or two that is worth the investment.  The company DOES give you a LOT for your money, in the way of sheer amount of the spice that they send you. I\\'d be very open to anyone here who wanted to send me recipes or ways to use it that might change my initial impression. So look out for future updates.  UPDATE: OK, I\\'m finally getting around to updating this, now that I\\'ve had time to try some of the suggestions of the kind commenters below. I like it pretty well now that I\\'ve tried it mixed with a few other herbs and especially on flat bread. It\\'s killer with flat bread dipped in fresh garlic lightly saute\\'d in butter, then mixed with the sumac and some Mexican oregano (try it: you\\'ll never use any other kind of oregano again--I used to HATE oregano, now I use the Mex. kind all the time). So I\\'ve upgraded to a four star on my review. Once you know how to use a spice, it makes all the difference. Just don\\'t follow the recipe on the bag...And thanks to everyone below who took the time to leave me so much info. I\\'m still working my way through the suggestions! Happy holidays to you all as well!  :-)',\n",
       " \"This oven was a replacement for it's predecessor we had for over 10 years.  When that one died I looked for a a new model that was close to the same as we really liked our old Panasonic. Newer models have replaced the keyboard with a dial that seemed pretty funky to me and some reviewers.  Then I hit on this one.  1250 watts, same as my old one..and a keyboard.  Reviews were mainly good.  This review is early so can't speak to longevity but after a couple days I have put it through it's paces.  First I found how much more quickly it cooks familiar items than the old one.  It also has some new functions and the old function of reheating and cooking by sensor.  I did not use that on the old one as I found it never did the job right.  Better by trial and error with the timer. This one didn't do any better on things I have tried.  But I am enjoying the power that had diminished over the years on my old one and the unit is sleek and good looking in our kitchen.  I hope it will have at least have as long a life as the old one but I also understand most of the new stuff is designed otherwise.  We'll see.\",\n",
       " \"this meter works well we called the company and spoke to the male (sales guy/tech) good help and want over meter and calibrated it three times (meter got more closer to the 4.01 (around 4.02, 4.03 (it does it times tak a while to find itself and can wounder around +/- 5 (there is a window of 3.96 to 4.06 which is 4 ). we tried several meters the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is a good meter but it only reads 0.0 good back up and it really works wells out of the others.  for the Milwaukee MW102 PH and Temperature Meter we find it works just a little better and gives more reading. Calibration works best if you use wash sample 4.01 than to sample 4.01 with temp prop and repeat. this meter is not junk it does take a little time to read to higher level the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is faster but not has accurate but close.  the Milwaukee MW102 PH unit is a basic PH meter with temp sample field unit good price in market for what it is--(no data sd card slots etc...). thanks milwaukee. (if the unit goes bad or anything i will post it so far so good).  unit is runing ok so far had to re calibrate (did it several) times with wash 4.01 and the test 4.01 etc.. and the meter sames to be reading +/- about 2 or 3 more close to 2. the meter works well just wish it would find its calibration zone faster. there are times where is just struggles to find the calibration and the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is all ready there. I have ordered cleaning solution to see if this helps.  ok i am returning this unit the 102 and will try the Milwaukee 105 pro model. the 102 just too many time takes to long to find it self to many times, eats up way to much time and i have to 2nd check it (so if i check 50 pools a day this meter will kill me... maybe probe change or broad but i can not use it working like this.  i will update on the Milwaukee 105 pro after using it i will update findings.  OK Milwaukee 105 pro works great. We had to call the company and get a replacement probe for unknown reason the 1st probe was faulty. the tech guys at Milwaukee are very helpful and help us with new replacement probe.  the Milwaukee 105 reads a little faster it sames than the 102 but the run is at time very close. BUT it works very well and both PH and TEMP are displayed on screen with this unit makes it nice to not have to switch screens. (the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is faster). this test is great for bench and table work. (after calibration this 105 meter was 100% on the money 4.00 and 7.00 and reads with a very high degree accuracy.  Final NOTE: Both units 102 and 105 Milwaukee's are (2 points) calibration the  Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is a (3 point) we called many companies for the answer and we are told that 3 points calibrate faster and many companies are moving to the pens and 3 point and auto cal from factory like the  Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 this pen has factory calibration without any butter set by the factory watch you can at any time set it back to factory ((we checked factory and it is right on for 4.0 ((not 0.00)) that good. like to see other meters have this option.  conclusion: 102 and 105 Milwaukee's are (2 points)slower than (3 points) work great. Great product and the Milwaukee's customer service was very helpful and fixed any issues. the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 we use and it is a great meter with great factory reset calibration without solution.  hope this helps all and please leave commands for others if you want thank you.\",\n",
       " \"C.L. Foster and E.R. Rada have teamed up to deliver a fresh new take on historical romance that is sure to leave readers in awe. Heart of War is set in the majestic era of knights and kings and the Hundred Years War. Adalira and Bastian are the children of nobles with their hearts set on the battlefield. Adalira is expected to be prim and proper as a Lady usually is, but she longs to wield a sword. Bastian is expected to be a diplomat, but his dream is to be a knight. When they meet, they just might be each other's key to breaking free of the mold and winning their families over.  I had the brilliant opportunity to beta-read this lovely story and I fell in love from the beginning. The characters are very well-rounded and easy to love, each of them unique with a great deal of personality. The world in which they live is vividly detailed, leaving nothing to the imagination while allowing the reader to become lost in the story. I'd consider this artwork at its finest, a picture painted in words dripping with creativity, talent, and passion for the craft.  The collaboration between C.L. Foster and up-and-coming author E.R. Rada is genius. They compliment each other well without breaking the story. While they each have their own writing style, the chapters flow together nearly seamlessly and, if you had not known better, it would be easy to believe that this book was penned by only one author.  I am looking forward to the next book by these two inspiring novelists, be it a collaboration or solo work. If you haven't picked up Heart of War yet, I urge you to do yourself a favor and take a chance on it.  P.S. My favorite character is Ezra. I'd say it was almost like he was written specifically for me. *wink* <3\",\n",

This story starts off so slow that I caught my attention drifting...I was daydreaming while reading!  I put this story down several times...something I never do.  What little action there is...well, it drags and characters are slow to connect with.  I kept waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen.  By chapter 10, I was still waiting.  We have two, young movie celebrities...Francesca Leon and Calder Fox.  Calder is a reformed douche and recovering drug addict.  He\\'s a sober/recovering alcoholic with a mess of emotional issues.  He\\'s trying to mend his ways from being a renowned manwhore of Hollywood...trying to salvage his reputation in the movie industry because nobody will hire him.  He\\'s a real hottie and is perfectly aware of his attraction to women and fans and he knows how to work it.  He battles with survivors remorse, guilt and depression among other things.  But he can also be kind and considerate.  He\\'s very sweet and understanding.  Francesca (Frankie) Leon is simply stunning, with her long dark hair and hazel green eyes.  She\\'s the type that takes relationships seriously....she must feel emotionally connected to someone before she acts or pursues someone, or allows them to pursue her.  She doesn\\'t jump easily or randomly.  She\\'s dedicated to her work...she\\'s kind and compassionate.  By chapter 17 this story began to grow on me a little bit even though it was moving at a snails pace.  And don\\'t misunderstand, I like a growing romance.  But this one just wouldn\\'t take off.  I eventually perked up a little when I read that Calder and Francesco had to pretend to \"like\" each other for publicity purposes while maintaining  their distance --- they had to make it believable that they were a couple to dredge up publicity for the movie they were both starring in.  I thought \"finally...this is going somewhere...it\\'s going to pick up the pace\".  But... I simply never connected to either of these two characters.  It was too little, too late.  Their interest in each other wasn\\'t believable.  Their attraction wasn\\'t believable.  I liked that Calder experienced so many \"firsts\".  First time to really get to know a woman before trying to jump her --- first time to appreciate a relationship or even have one --- first time being committed to anything (people/friends, movie set) ----first time being celibate, etc.  As much as I liked him, his feelings of unworthiness and self loathing and thinking he was undeserving of anything overshadowed the plot.  This story was predictable.  A guy with a massive ego and issues doesn\\'t want an emotional relationship, yet begins to feel more than he bargained for and faces getting hurt and relapsing (fall off the wagon).  On the \"up side\", I liked that there wasn\\'t the usual misunderstandings or false assumptions between the two main characters...they were both open with their questions to each other.  If any confusion or wrong ideas from the paparazzi would begin to arise, they\\'d talk it out openly.  But the drama was mild and not very interesting.  The conflict wasn\\'t much either....more built up to be a problem that what was actually problematic.  Ms. Grace made lots of silly written mistakes that weren\\'t edited out, like; \"...he brushed my hair away from my house\"...???!!?!?  It took me 4 days to read this story...that never happens with me.  Not with a story of this short length.',\n",
       " 'I admire authors who create characters who look and act nothing like them.  Ms. Cheever is a non-black author who took the leap into the BWWM genre ... and, in my opinion, failed miserably with the four novellas contained therein.  In the first novella, the she-wolf is described as \"creamy brown,\" but much later in the story the same she-wolf has \"alabaster\" skin.  If my webster\\'s dictionary is working correctly, the word \"alabaster\" is typically used to described white skin.  And then later, yes, in the same novella, we are told that she has pale cheeks. So which is it?  Is this a BWWM story or did the author initially create the story with a white character in mind?  Confused.  Despite the problems I saw with the first novella, I continued to read.  Yes, the four novellas are formulaic [she-wolf meets vampire/wolf man then she-wolf pretends like she never wants to mate then they come together to battle some great evil then they fall in love and mate.  Simple, but the problems persisted (for me anyway).  In the third novella, the she-wolf is described as \"ebony\" colored.  So, then how does a dark skinned person pale?  And do dark skinned women\\'s nipples resemble cranberries?  Hmm... no.. that would be for another skin color or race.  After reading Ms. Cheever\\'s stories, I really wanted to learn about Lupires and the vampire council.  Great story idea.  I would not, however, want to read this as a BWWM.  Ms. Cheever writes from her own perspective -- so most of her characters that don\\'t look like her still have the same physical attributes (alabaster skin, cranberry nipples, paling when scared, etc.) as she does.  More importantly, there is nothing about these stories (other than the author describing the characters as brown, ebony, earth toned, russet, etc) that would lead anyone to think that the characters are non-white.  Does she have to write a story with a gum cracking, head shaking, finger popping stereotype?  No, but it would be nice to read a BWWM story from Ms. Cheever that made other BW say, \"Wow.  I get it.  I do that too.\"  Although well written and edited with love, I didn\\'t get it.  I\\'ll buy Ms. Cheever\\'s novels in the future because I think she is a great writer and I like her style, but not if its a BWWM novel.',\n",
       " \"This book contains 2 novellas.... The Crown of the Queen by Jeffe Kennedy... 3.5 stars and The Undying King by Grace Draven... 5+ stars  I have to say if I'd read Jeffe Kennedy's The Twelve Kingdoms series, I probably would've adored The Crown of the Queen. But... I haven't read anything by this author so I was completely lost. There was just too much everything happening regarding crowning a new queen and all the information regarding a huge cast of characters I'd never met before. It's told through the eyes of Dafne, the librarian, and even though the writing is good, I felt like I was just slogging through it, waiting for the romance to start. This was supposed to be a 'romance', but aside from a man flirting with her as they danced and giving her a good-bye kiss in the beginning, that was all the romance there was. I kept reading and reading and wondering why Dafne's HEA hadn't been introduced. Then I started wondering if maybe Dafne was telling the story of the queen's romance with her consort, but that wasn't really it either. In the end, this novella seems like a backstory bridge to another book, which it probably is. As I said before, I might've loved this if I'd read the series.  On to the reason I bought this book... The Undying King. After falling madly in love with Radiance and every other book Grace Draven has written, she is now one of my auto-buy authors. This story is full of love, loss and redemption and my heart broke for both Cededa and Imogen.  Cededa the Fair, or Cededa the Butcher... The Undying King... are perfect names for a king who is unbelievable gorgeous and also who would do anything, ANYTHING, to save his kingdom. He had fallen into myth.. a kingdom lost to time. Imogen is cursed with the touch of death--anyone who touches her skin dies--so she's never known the touch of a lover and never expected to. She's given a key to find his kingdom and told only The Undying King can remove her curse.  There are other plots within plots going on as well, because Imogen is not just some lowly witches' apprentice/daughter and Cededa's kingdom is rumored to hold treasures untold. Retrieving Imogen from Cededa's kingdom becomes another man's quest.  The romance between Imogen and Cededa builds slowly and sweetly and I loved every minute of it. This story is written with such rich imagery, I felt I could see Cededa's kingdom on every page.  I would've purchased this book for The Undying King alone, but I'm glad to have been introduced to Jeffe Kennedy's The Twelve Kingdoms series through The Crown of the Queen.\",\n",

       " 'This jar of strong glycolic cream is the real deal! I have a totally unscientific and brute force way to test potency of glycolic (or vitamin c) products: put a dab on a fresh shaven inner thigh. If it burns, it definitely has potency. This cream burned, OUCH!  (I washed it off that area immediately).  As for usage, the instructions are on the box, so keep it! (They are so short, they really should be on the jar). You are to leave it on feet or elbows 10-15 minutes, then rinse off. However, I use the instructions on dermatologist Cynthia Bailey\\'s web site: use pumice stone after showering, apply cream, and wear socks for eight hours. Here\\'s a little time and hand saver: wash hands, after applying cream (you must) and pumice stone at the same time. Two washings in one. And the pumice stone is much more easily cleaned sooner than later after use.  The result? Noticeable softening of rough skin on feet! Expect an improvement as early as after the first use and even more after 3-5 uses. I am using it every other day for a week, then a week off, then back to every other day, etc. Not exactly, but something like that.  I usually am skeptical about products such as this from somewhere other than a dermatologists\\' office or authorized brand dealer, but in this case, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s the real thing. Also it has an expiration date (some products don\\'t) and the day was way out, not  anytime soon.  I hate pedicures!

       " \"First off the PS3 version of this game did get quite a few bad reviews at first because of all the bugs and the serious lag that kicks in after plalying for a while. but since the newest patch (Patch 1.4) a lot of things have been fixed. I haven't had any problems with the lag since the update, and they fixed the common mission glitches that this game use to have there may still be more but I haven't run into any others.  I will cover the limited edition items before the gameplay since thats the version I am reviewing. The statue is oh my god awesome, it looks great and is a nice addition to my dragon statues. The art book that it comes with has some great art in it that goes over quite a bit of stuff. The Bonus of DVD I haven't actually watched yet since whenever i look at Skyrim i go straight for the game.  Now I was a HUGE fan of Oblivion I put so many fun filled hours into that game and I must say Skyrim is even more awesome than that. It is improved in so many ways. Obviously the graphics are greatly improved the world is just beautiful. The combat is also improved from Oblivion. The Story was just fantastic a bit short but this game has SOOOO many side quests that even after putting over 300 hours into the game I still haven't completed everything. The game has practically all the guilds Oblivion had, it has the mages guild, the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood, and the companions is practically the fighters guild.  They took a few things out, nothing extremly dissapointing though. You can't create your own spells anymore. There is no greaves in this game the cuirass and greaves are just one set of armor, most people im sure wouldn't care but it kinda bugged me. Another thing that im sure most people wouldn't mind is your armor and weapons don't get damaged in this game, I kinda liked that option but I do kinda like it this way so my weapon does't break in battle.  They added some awesome stuff like Smithing, you can create your armor and weapons in the game you may also sharpen your weapons to make them stronger or enhance your armor at a workbench. You can get married, not an amazing option but its pretty cool to do. And quite a bit more cool stuff has been added.  The level up system is definitley better, now every skill level up will go towards a character level not just level up your major skills. You get a perk for every level up you obtain in the game which you can put into whatever skill you want and get different perks for the skills other then set perks depending on your skills level... I probably didn't explain that too well.  I don't have anything bad to say about this game now that the pack has been released. I would definitley recommend this game to any action rpg lover out there i don't see how anyone can be dissapointed by this masterpiece. Its easily one of the best games I have EVER played, I have been playing for the last few months and i'm still having fun with Skyrim.  So yeah this is a must have game.\",\n",
       " 'The title on this exercise DVD does not really match the actual content. \"Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth\" may be a better title.  Tonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you\\'re looking for a beginner\\'s stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.  Also, if you\\'re looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what\\'s called the \"Spritual Warm-Up\", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it\\'s marketed as a regular \"stretching\" video.  The practice is somewhat weak, Tonya\\'s voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.  The introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to \"Acres 4 Life\" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome!

       " 'After recently seeing a Bob Newhart performance at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, in which Bob received two separate standing ovations, I decided to finally buy the complete series box set of \"The Bob Newhart Show.\"  Therefore, I have no problems with the earlier releases of the first four seasons of the show.  In addition, although the video quality isn\\'t of high-definition quality, the episodes are eminently watchable.  All problematic issues were soon forgotten after I started watching the show.  Bob Newhart was one of the first successful stand-up comedians to star in a TV sitcom.  That started a trend that continued with Tim Allen, Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld, and many others.  In addition, the show was not cancelled by CBS because of poor ratings.  After six successful seasons, Bob decided that is was time to end the series.  The writing on the show perfectly suited Bob\\'s personality and comedic style.  The casting choices were uniformly excellent, especially with Suzanne Pleshette as Bob\\'s wife Emily.  Special mention must be made of Jack Riley as Bob\\'s patient Elliot Carlin, who appeared in 56 of the 142 episodes.  To say that he is an unforgettable character is an understatement.  The box set also includes an informative booklet, which gives a brief synopsis of each episode, along with its original airdate.  What really makes this box set special are the bonus features.  Audio commentary is provided on several episodes.  The bonus disc includes the original, unaired pilot.  In it, Peter Bonerz plays Dr. Jerry Robinson as another psychologist, instead of an orthodontist.  Marcia Wallace does not appear as secretary Carol Kester, nor does Bill Daily appear as nutty navigator and neighbor Howard Borden.  The 19th Anniversary special is also included.  It takes place on the day after Bob had a dream about being a Vermont innkeeper named Dick Loudon.  The most surreal moment of the special is when they show a clip of Bill Daily as Major Roger Healey on the \"I Dream Of Jeannie\" TV series.  The bonus disc also includes \"Group Therapy,\" which was recorded in Los Angeles in December of 2013.  It\\'s a nostalgic discussion of the show with Bob Newhart, Peter Bonerz, Bill Daily, Jack Riley, and director Michael Zinberg.  Sadly, Suzanne Pleshette and Marcia Wallace had both passed away, and are sorely missed in the discussion group.  Bob and Bill do show their age, while Peter has held up well.  Sadly, Jack Riley had a stroke, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair.  This look back to when they were all in their prime is bittersweet, as time has taken its toll on all of the participants.  Fortunately, the TV show\\'s comedy is timeless, and has held up very well over the years.',\n",
       " 'This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a \"star vehicle\" back in Hollywood\\'s Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It\\'s as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.  \"Air Force One\" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?  The Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don\\'t know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don\\'t know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.  Ford mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he\\'s below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.  Don\\'t expect a tremendous amount from \"Air Force One.\" and it won\\'t disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in \"Air Force One\" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can\\'t work with what you don\\'t have.',\n",
       " \"Pressed for time, but a quick review: Took me a while to realize the subtleties of a compressor. Finally made the decision due to trying to control dynamics and even out attack when amp master is cranked. Running the SP as first in my effects chain in front of a Blues Junior NOS, using a Strat w/Texas Specials. I did not expect the tonal aspects of this pedal. As a clean boost, this pedal makes my amp sparkle. Beautiful full, super clean tone with just the right amount of breakup for pick attack.  Very solid and well built little unit with very good loocks. When you crank either knob, the noise floor is amplified; I think this is more of an issue with equipment noise, not the SP. The manual specifically points this out, so if you hear people complain about noise, it might not be a fair assessment. Important to know that it's very easy to dial in the noise by adjusting the knobs. I've been able to get the tone I want with no noise at all.  Compressor evens out dynamics and adds sustain. I prefer the mid-compression toggle selection. Haven't played with the internal dip switches that affect attack. Not interested in this level of refinement right now. Enjoy playing with the volume and blend knobs -- so many great tones.  Not usually into pedal aesthetics, but this is a sexy piece of kit. The LED shines through the translucent knobs and looks like eye candy. Only issue is that it's so thin it can tend to tip to either side with the weight of cables. Haven't been able to velcro it down yet. Only play in bedroom and cannot give feedback on stage worthiness.  This is definitely going to be an always-on pedal. So glad I bought this. Unexpected all-star. Can't wait to try out more Xotic products.\",\n",
       " \"I already owned a Hohner Instructor 32 and Performer 37, but when I saw the price for the Hurricane Harps S32 I just couldn't pass up the deal. Now that I have it, I'm beginning to wonder whether most of these melodicas are made in the same factories and are simply branded differently. This one is nearly identical to the Hohner Instructor 32. The plastic molding is clearly the same, literally identical. The main differences between the Hohner and this one are the finishing touches, the mouthpieces, and the cases. The Hurricane Harps S32 doesn't have quite the high-gloss sheen of the Hohner, you can still see faint swirl marks from where the Hurricane Harps melodica was buffed after casting whereas the Hohner is completely polished and shiny. The handles on both melodicas are identical in pattern and material but the Hurricane Harps' handle is white and the Hohner's is black. The mouthpieces that came with the Hurricane are a straight one and a tube with a straight end, while the Hohner has more of a goose neck mouthpiece and the tube has a 90 degree elbow at the bottom to reduce the amount of bending required when playing on a tabletop. The Hohner's case/bag is made of nicer fabric but the Hurricane Harps case has metal buckles and clips (plastic on the Hohner). Both melodicas sound pretty much the same, though the Hohner has slightly better reed response on the highest couple of notes. The price difference between this and the Hohner seems to pay for cosmetic features more than functional ones.  One or two other reviews here stated that this melodica doesn't have a spit valve, which is simply not true. This melodica has a spit valve on the bottom just like all melodicas, you don't have to take out the screws and open the thing up just to let the moisture out.  This is a fine melodica and for a great price. You really can't go wrong with this one!\",\n",
       " \"Love the Texas Heat. It does cleans well and a nice hint of midrange comes through with overdrive. The speaker is somewhat neutral. It will pretty much do what you want it to do. If you scoop the mids on your tone controls the TH handles that well. Push the mids and it hangs with the program well. Highs are nice without being piercing. The highs settled down somewhat once you get a couple hours playing time through the speaker too. Bottom end is solid and tight. I've never been disappointed with either a closed back or open back install. I've put these in so many cabs, amps etc. Currently I have a 4x12 loaded with them and I replaced the speaker in my Peavey Vypyr 75 with one. The Vypyr was a total experiment. Since it's a modeling amp it needs to recreate many different tones. The TH pulls it off well - much better than the Vypyr's stock speaker. The Vypyr in stock form sounds decent. But its speaker has a pretty thick/heavy cone and it is relatively hi-fi sounding. The result is that the amp sounds a bit sterile. The TH solved that. It sounds much more like a guitar amp now - if that makes any sense. There is a more woody, natural element to the amp's tones now.\",\n",
       " \"Beautiful!!! This case looks great on the outside. The brass hardware is a gorgeous accent to the tweed and brown leather. On the down side, I really wish they would have used a brown leather handle instead of the plastic handle it can with. It would have been that much more comfortable. Secondly, the screwheads on the feet aren't quite recessed enough. I placed my case on a table and bumped it and left a three inch scratch on the surface of the wood table. Bummer. Lesson learned.  The inside is plush, great funky vintage color, perfect fit for a strat. Two small compartments provide just enough space for most things. I wish there was a larger recess for the bottom strap button. I have fender locking strap buttons and I cant leave the strap attached and set the guitar in the case. But to me, Im nitpicking.  I wouldnt choose another case over this for my purposes. But if you need something that can withstand a bit more wear and tear, don't get the tweed.\",\n",
       " \"This printer is awesome!  The first one that I received was defective.  After a 30 minute call to HP customer service, a new one was on the way.  The new one works perfectly and we have not had any issues in a month since we received it.  Things I really like about this printer are:  It is very quiet and fast. Printer range is great and we can print from anywhere in our house and even from the garage.  It uses very little ink - in a month we are still using the initial ink cartridges that came with the printer.  It has a small footprint and the only wired connection is for power.  2 sided printing is great and totally automatic.  You can use heavyweight card stock in the printer.  HP customer service was fast, efficient and complete - about a week after receiving the new printer, they gave me a follow up call to ensure it was working properly.  Ink jet nozzles don't clog up immediately like all of our past Epson printers.  Touchscreen makes a great user interface.  For a low priced printer, I cannot think of any cons.  Very glad we chose this printer and we feel its a great value.\",\n",
       " 'Once assembled the product is exactly what I wanted which was an electric with no charcoal and gas fuss and most importantly a rotisserie. It\\'s light weight, 23 pounds or so, and as long as you have an electrical outlet you can use the product. The heating element were able to be adjusted to one of 3 different positions which was what I wanted, flat, 45 degrees, and perpendicular, or verticle position for rotisserie function which I really wanted.  My product search showed no other product available that did this and was the clincher for buying the product. Now the downside: 1. The package was delivered and left out in the rain and got soaked but did not damage the product. We all know plastic bags are available.  FedEx was the culprit. Just irresponsible. 2. The assembly brochure is written hieroglyphics. Blurry illustrations and badly written text explanations. It\\'s a mishmash of information intermingling several different models.  I had to look at the carton to determine what model I bought by manufacturers part number to tie in the instructions. 3. The nuts and bolts assembly required did not include lock washers...now really, we all know things come lose without washers, which I had in my workshop and provided myself...we are talking pennies here. 4. The temperature adjustment dial had numbers printed on the circular label that was of a font size and style that was barely readable. Large more readable numbers would be nice.    Items 1-4 are minor in the overall and easily corrected. I imagine there is a YouTube page showing the product assembly and if not should be. I did not check to see and the product information did not reference a page that I recall.

       " 'Out of the three Bliss Garden Terrariums I bought, this is my absolute favorite.  It includes a tiny air plant, three different colors of moss, a branched stick, a sea urchin shell, sand, a thin glass terrarium globe that looks like a tipped brandy snifter, and a set of instructions.  The components come wrapped in tissue paper or bubble wrap, but loose in the box so you may have to hunt for them.  (There isn\\'t a single, giftable box containing everything.)  Except for the pedestal portion, the glass is extremely thin and therefore fragile.  From base to top, it measures about 5\".  Assembly took about ten minutes and is easier if you use tweezers, although fingers are fine.  All you do is dump the sand in the bottom and arrange the rest according to your preferences.  The air plant must be submerged in water before adding.  You\\'ll have to water the plant in this way about once a week, so make sure you can remove it without disturbing the rest.  I placed mine on top of the sea urchin hole, as per the product photo, and the base of the plant is a little too big (or the sea urchin too small) for a perfect fit, which means its more balanced there than inside.  This makes a unique and beautiful gift, although you\\'ll have to find a small box that will fit everything because it doesn\\'t come in any form that is truly gift-able, something I hope the company will rectify in the future.  (If you pre-assemble it, the scene is unlikely to make it to its destination intact.)  I\\'ve paired this pedestal terrarium with a teardrop one and a succulent globe, and they are substantial enough together to draw your eye to them.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann',\n",
       " \"I bought this as a last resort before purchasing an eCollar for our 15# Jack Russell who-knows-what mix and our 32# Beagle-Schnauzer mix.  Both are adopted and lovable most of the time, but once the doorbell rings, the school bus stops, or someone walks past our house, they start uncontrollable, loud and embarrassing  barking, which frightens many children and people.  We had tried a citronella collar which worked ok, but  it would go off on its own or when a dog close-by barked so it was not a good training tool.  And within six months the collar stopped working. We then spent more  money on odd-size batteries which didn't help. A costly waste.  I thought I would give this whistle a try.  I actually had tried a less expensive whistle at one point, but it had no effect.  But after seeing so many positive reviews on this whistle, I thought I would try it.  It was amazing.  It made our Jack Russell mix stop barking immediately and just look at me.  It didn't seem to have any effect on our Sneagle (vet's name for her), but after a couple frequency adjustments, she, too, calmed down and stopped barking.  I've only had it 24 hours and hopefully it continues to work on them. If so, it is a life saver.  I'll advise how it goes over time.  (Additional comment):  I thought the instructions on how to adjust the frequency were not detailed enough to be helpful and there is nothing at all on there website about how to adjust it.  You must first pull off the black case that attaches over the whistle.  You just pull it off hard.  The adjustment circular screw is near the bottom of the whistle.  Adjust it as you blow to see what works best on your dog.  After you find the frequency you want, tighten the circular screw and replace the black rubber cover.  Luckily, both of my dogs respond to one frequency.  If you have multiple dogs, you may need multiple whistles with different frequencies.  I plan on getting another whistle or two to keep one at the back door for when they are in the yard and one near the front door for traffic there.\",\n",
       " \"My cats love this new Drinkwell Pet Fountain.  Can't believe how much a difference it makes in how the cats drink their water.  And my dogs also love this unit.  Prior to this I had a 64 oz container that refilled the drinking well as the cats drank the water down.  This units aerates the water and I guess that makes it more palatable to the cats and dogs.  Easy to refill the container.  Just pick it straight up from the unit, no water spills as the automatic shutoff drops down and holds what little water is left in the reservoir.  When refilling, I turn the reservoir into the install position before I carry it back to the unit.  That way, the shut off holds the water without spilling.  Easy to clean.  I disassemble the unit when cleaning in a sink.  Nothing much to that.  I purchased a vinyl pet mat with a lip to go under mine, as one of my cats likes to paw at the running water. One cat must have liked the smell, as he started rolling in the floor as if Catnip was present.  I purchased this unit.  It was not provided for a positive review. I highly recommend this unit.\",\n",

I squeeked the eggs, and showed him me putting it in the platypus. At first he just played with the platypus squeeking the eggs through it. He didn\\'t get it. I took something familiar, the squirrel from the hide a squirrel, and put it in the platypus with its tail sticking out so it\\'s obvious. He pulled it out like he would with the plush tree stump. I praise, and with a couple of more trys I change it to the egg. I don\\'t put the egg all the way in at first. When he pulled the egg, I praised him and gradually put the eggs deeper into the toy. Now he knows how it works and can pull all the eggs out in seconds.(I then get my dog to fetch all the eggs so I can fill it up for him again)  It\\'s now really a challenge for him, but he has fun playing with it, which is the point. He loves squeeking the eggs, and not really interested in the platypus shell. He did chew up one egg with his molars, but good thing the toy come with two extra eggs.  On the downside, I suspect that the praising when pulling the eggs out of the toy taught him to pull all the stuffing out of the other regular toys he has. He wasn\\'t really into that before, and now he pulls out the stuffings with much excitement and enthusiasm. If your dog alraedy enjoys that then the platypus toy give him an alternative. Another thing is that the stitchings on the opening on the toy\\'s stomach has stretched, almost about to pop out, but it\\'s not really noticable so I don\\'t really care.  The egg babies toy is a good one that is different from your regular stuffed animal dog toy. It is more interactive. I would recommend it to other people.',\n",
       " 'Wow! I\\'ve been thinking about upgrading my tubes to LEDs for a while; after getting to the point where about six bulbs and one ballast were dead, I decided to take the plunge. I ended up spending $95 on this purchase, rather than spending about $75 on the bulbs and a replacement ballast, so for just $25 I upgraded six fixtures to all-LED lighting.  Those four fixtures were each four-bulb fixtures, but I had already been okay with lower light levels with a few bulbs burnt out. So I figured I would just install two of these bulbs and see how it looked. In short, each one of these tubes are MUCH brighter than a pair of five year old fluorescent bulbs. So the overall light level went UP when I went from four bulbs to two LED tubes. And my power consumption went down from 250 watts per room to 48.  So doing the math, at about six hours a day, I have saved $16 per bulb per year - and since the bulbs were just $8 each, these bulbs will pay for themselves in just six months.  Installation was very easy. I\\'m handy with tools, so your experience may differ. But the instruction sheet was very clear, and I made SURE before I started that I had shunted \"tombstone\" bulb holders that would be compatible with these dual-end-wired tubes. (One of my fixtures was non-shunted; since I had to remove a lot of extra wire during the conversion, I simply shunted them myself and still had quite a bit of wire to discard.) It took me under ten minutes per four-bulb fixture, and the resulting wiring was a lot simpler than with a ballast.  The bulbs fit perfectly. The pins are slightly smaller diameter than regular fluorescent tubes, so they were not quite as tight as I wanted in the press-in tombstones (but they were fine in the older twist-in tombstones); however, they are tight enough to stay put, and these tubes are pretty light.  Since I just installed these today, I naturally can\\'t report on reliability, but I\\'m not really concerned; the quality looked decent and they were well-packaged.  In my mind, the only negative was that the clear (non-frosted) tubes mean easily visible bright bands across the fixture diffuser plastic. But that was my choice, since frosted tubes waste lumens and I would have had less light.  I highly recommend these bulbs.',\n",
       " 'Pros: * Easy and automatic daily backup of all your Windows computers * Easy file sharing * Familiar Windows GUI * Great for non-techies but only after it\\'s setup correctly * Low system requirements by today\\'s standards * Easily add to storage by just adding drives to make one \"big pot\" of storage * Easily set up a shared folder that duplicates files across more than one HD in case one HD fails (just toggle a setting)  Cons: * BEWARE! When upgrading to an SSD, I found out that WHS would not restore to a smaller partition than the original. Instead, I had to use Acronis TrueImage to do this - which worked great, BTW. * The restore disc did not detect any network interfaces on a Dell 1525 notebook... so a bit of a hassle since correct drivers would have to be found for it to restore. * Terrible policy of having to do a \"server reinstallation\" to use an OEM key when you use the trial version. This loses all your settings and installed programs but supposedly not your data... plus you have to download and install a ton of updates (80+ as of mid Jan 2010, and then another 9 on the \"second pass\"), all over again. * Not only the above, but also had to reinstall the connector on all the machines to get the connection back to the server. Very disappointing. * Driver problems - some drivers may be non-existent or difficult to get. I had to stick an old 10/100 Intel network card in the machine so that it could get on the Internet and get the right network drivers for my Gigabyte motherboard (Marvell Yukon 88E8056). And I had to do this TWICE because I had to do the server reinstallation. * If you have to deal with what I did, then setup could take you a lot longer than you\\'d expect. * Can\\'t easily use a USB external drive to backup your Windows Home Server if you also want to backup the backups. I wanted to backup everything, including the backups, to a 2TB ioSafe waterproof/fireproof external USB HD but it would only backup the shares and not the backups. However, it seems this can be done manually so I created a script to copy the data directory to the external ioSafe drive and I will set this script to run weekly. Take a look at the Microsoft Technical Brief on Backup and Restore on what to do. * No easy encryption, especially to external USB drives where you might want it more, but you might be able to use TrueCrypt to provide encryption. * Difficulty activating even after a server reinstallation - got message number 32777 - had to fiddle with Internet Explorer settings to get it to work - see Microsoft Support Article 816897 if you have this problem too  The Test: * I\\'m simulating a failure by changing out the SSD in a Gateway T-6836 with Intel T5750 CPU notebook computer running Vista x64 (changing from an OCZ 60GB Solid to a Kingston 40GB SSD that uses the Intel 2nd generation controller). * I downloaded the latest WHS Restore CD (2009-11-23) from Microsoft and installed it. It placed a CD ISO image in the installation directory and I used the Windows Disc Image Burner tool (included in Windows 7) to burn the CD. * I removed the old OCZ SSD from the notebook and installed the new Kingston one. * I booted from the restore CS and it asked me if I was restoring a computer with less than 512MB of memory or 512MB or more of memory (shouldn\\'t it be able to figure this out?) - I have more than 512MB so I chose that option. * Looks like it booted into a version of Vista. * It asked me about drivers - looks like all the needed drivers were already available (good) - otherwise I had the option to provide/install them. * It looked for my Windows Home Server and found it - then asked me for the WHS password. * It asked me what computer to restore and from which backup day. It defaulted to the correct computer. * It asked me some questions about the restore disk and I had the option to use a \"Disk Manager\" but I didn\\'t. * Restore started about 2:58PM and finished (reported SUCCESSFULLY) about 3:36 PM so about 38 minutes to restore 28.7GB of used space according to the properties dialog for the C drive (The new SSD is a value SSD and has a slow sequential write speed of about 40MB/s - its biggest downside). * FINAL RESULT: It works smoothly! I did not run into any problems that can be attributed to WHS while restoring the system. Couldn\\'t have been much simpler.  Other: * Based on Windows Server 2003 * Giving it 4 stars out of 5 because once it is setup, it\\'s easy to use and works well, but the setup and activation itself was very poor. * I installed RealVNC so I could access the desktop easily. I prefer it over the Microsoft provided solution (Remote Desktop).',\n",

That I don\\'t have a problem with.  However, a lot of the complaints I\\'m reading here are from people who seem to like to complain.  God help you if you have a positive opinion about something, you get branded stupid, your opinion is invalid. It seems that the only way you can be accepted anymore on the Internet is to have a negative opinion. Sigh.  Edit: Since I posted this review, I saw some additional text go up on the product description for TurboTax.  This text reads \"FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product.\"  This was not part of my original review, and it seems to imply Intuit has backed off some of the initial E filing limits.  As I have not filed, I cannot attest to how this actually works at this time.',\n",
       " 'Having worked with Windows 8.1 for a while now, and having also worked with various other devices/operating systems, here are my opinions:  Windows 8.1 vs Windows 8.0: Why compare?  The upgrade is free and there is nothing but upside.  Windows 8.1 vs Windows 7: In my opinion, Windows 8.1 has all the functionality of Windows 7, and then some.  Some folks really seem upset at how the start menu was changed, but it took me about a day to adjust to that.  You can still find all of your apps using the same keystrokes (or mouse clicks) that you already used.  The \"look\" of the tiles popping up rather than a long list of apps has changed, but that\\'s really it.  My advice - if you\\'re already on Windows XP or later, ignore the naysayers and make the upgrade (assuming your PC is compatible).  Then give yourself a week of using it steadily before you pass judgment.  Windows 8.1 vs Mac OS: In my opinion, Windows 7 pretty much gave me all the benefits of the Mac OS (I know I\\'ll get some negative comments for that, but I truly did use both and came back to Windows when they came out with Win 7).  So, based on my previous paragraph, I think Windows 8.1 compares well to the Mac OS.  Unless you\\'re using Windows 8.1 in tablet mode, I don\\'t think I\\'d go so far as to say it is vastly superior to Mac - only comparable.  Windows 8.1 vs iPad: This assumes you\\'re using a tablet with Win 8.1 (I\\'m using a Surface Pro).  I tried using an iPad for a few years and other than playing games, surfing the web and checking email, it never seemed to be a great device for me.  I wanted something I could type notes into and even work on documents.  I tried adding a keyboard and apps that worked with Microsoft Office.  But just never seemed to quite work for me.  Essentially, I only did the kinds of things with my iPad that I would do with a phone.  With Windows 8.1 on a tablet device, I get nearly all the benefits of an iPad (though iPads do still have some advantages in tablet mode, such as form factor, weight and battery life - but none of those matter much if I can\\'t be productive) AND I get all the advantages of a laptop PC.  And without lugging two devices all over the place.  Using Win 8.1, I dock my Surface Pro at the office and it is a full powered desktop computer with fullsize keyboard, mouse and monitor.  When working with clients, I have a small keyboard, or I have a stylus that allows me to take handwritten notes and draw pictures (this can be a big deal when you\\'re consulting - a keyboard puts a \"wall\" between you and a client, and trying to use a stylus with an iPad to take notes was a non-starter for me).',\n",
       " 'I am in no way a yoga expert. I am a beginner who first started on borrowed mats. When I decided to purchase my own, my first stop was a Target I was in, their mats seemed fine, but I wanted to do some research first.  One thing I knew going in was that I wanted the most padding possible because I\\'m sensitive to hard surfaces when doing many yoga positions and exercises (especially anything involving balancing on my tush and/or tailbone). Many reviews here say this mat is thicker than many others. That, as well as the average five star review and the non-slip extra were reasons for my purchase.  Upon first opening it, the mat seemed shockingly thin; it was certainly thinner than my expectations based on the previous mats I\\'ve used which seemed to be lesser quality. But I stepped on, tried a few of my problematic poses and I was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps this mat is just as thick as my borrowed mats but something about the material makes it not flatten under my weight as much as previous mats. I\\'m just hoping that this doesn\\'t mean my borrowed mats used to perform the same way but flattened overtime, and so I hope it doesn\\'t happen with this mat as well. Time will tell.  There\\'s a definite and strong \"direct off the factory machine\" smell as soon as you break open the cellophane. I\\'m not worried; I\\'m certain that smell will go away. I actually like it; it\\'s the scent of guarantee that it\\'s brand-new. :)  The texture feels similar to the previous mats I tried, with just a bit more rigidness to it. This is not bad; it\\'s not uncomfortable and it is not rough. It helps me feel like it has extra grip so I won\\'t slip on it, and it won\\'t slip along the floor.  I purchased the Earth color, and it looks just as it does in the photograph. Obviously I can\\'t say this about the other colors as I have no in person view of them.  I found it interesting how it was rolled up thinking that because the bottom side would lay against the top side when olled up, it had to be rolled the opposite way. Of course, no matter which direction you roll it, the top will make contact with the underside. Oops. I now believe the purpose of the pre-rolled direction is so the mat curves towards the floor when laid out so as not up to curl up towards the ceiling.  For some reason I thought this came with a carrying case, it does not. Do they sell yoga mats cases by themselves? (Not including a caring case is not enough to take away a star in the review.)  So, aside from the not included holder I\\'m pretty happy with this product so far. Of course I\\'ve just received it and haven\\'t spent extensive time on it, I try to update my reviews in cases like this with how the product has been holding up over time.',\n",
       " \"Used this for the first time today. I have to say that I love it. Its well made, easy to use, fast to inflate and put away. Made a couple stupid mistakes the first time out, but I also inflated it at the launch site, put it in and headed up the river.  Most of the time I will use it by myself, but did take a friend with me. It had way more room than I anticipated. As long as you shove the back seat as far back as you can, it will gain you a few extra inches. Just slightly punch each side back and forth and it does go back further than just pushing it together with 2 hands. (hard to explain, but made a big difference). The heights of the 2 of us was 59 and 56. We were both comfortable.  Love the pro seats. Really comfortable. Dont feel like Kayak seats. Great support and I didn't even use the blue support straps (because I didn't look closely at the instructions). The only down side to these seats is that it takes a lot longer to dry, but easy to take inside the condo (I live in a high-rise) to re-inflate and fully let the canvas dry. I still wouldnt go with the lighter weight deluxe ones  The double inflate valves makes it inflate and deflate really fast. I didn't need to use the pump. Once you unscrew the lower valve the air comes right out. You just have to really catch the water that is trapped all the way in the bow and particularly the stern. Still easy to dry to put away.  I wish it came with bungy cords across the bow to stow things like a life jacket if its in a place thats not mandatory to wear but I can probably come up with something to make it work.  Regardless this is a great Kayak in all ways. Cant wait to see the fall colors change next month.  I would suggest that if you are deflating it in a grassy area that you put it on a plastic tarp. It makes it easier so that you don't have to continually dry off the grass thats stuck to it because it was wet. Use camping chamois towels to dry it off. They absorb a lot of water and are so much less bulky than a regular towel.\",\n",
       " \"I have carried a lot of cheap knives while I was in the Marines. Mostly because they were tools and I didn't mind throwing them away if I broke them. (ok and also because I was on a budget:) My favorite knife to this point was my Kabar and my cold steel recon one half serrated folder. I have had the folder for 17 years and just broke the tip the other day. Decided to step into the $100 and beyond folding knives for my replacement now that I am retired and make more money. I was skeptical because the HK  (Koch is pronounced coke btw) was going to replace my old trusted and true knife which has seen me through three wars and was as dependable as they come. Well the HK arrived yesterday and I was really impressed whn I pulled it out of the box. Some knives you know right away aren't going to be good, well this one I knew right away Was going to be good. The handle has excellent grip and although it has a slight plastic feel, still feels solid due to metal liners. Blade is responsive and snaps into place quickly and holds securely. I have some cheap open assist knives like the SOG which are Ok but I like the feel of a responsive blade and not having to wonder if today is the day that the spring is going to fail. Good teeth on the serrated edge and I really like the shape of the blade not too fat or skinny. One drawback on a lot of knives is the clip being either too loose or too tight. Well this one was like goldilocks and was just right. I had no problems getting my knife out or putting it back one handed. I am a roof inspector now and wore this one in the rain all day cutting open various items. I have never had a blade move to the number one spot as quickly as this, but the HK is a solid workhorse. If you are on the fence about this knife I would recommend buying it. I also ordered the Benchmade Adamas 275 but at almost double the price that one may be just a defense weapon when it gets here. Best of luck  Pros for me are: No slip grip Clip Open/Closing Size  Cons for me are: Price Slight plastic feel of handle\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s called a shop heater, but don\\'t expect it to put out tons of heat. Your shop better be insulated. I bought this because I\\'ve had good success with another Optimus product, and they have 3-year warranties and wanted something for the shop/garage.  Physical: The build quality and design actually seem pretty decent, and seems fairly durable, although time will tell. The knobs and the plastic are pretty good quality with smooth action in the switches. The handle is actually very convenient. It is not a heavy device by any means but the handle really makes it simple to move around.  A cool feature is the base/stand. It allows tilting of the heater up or down as needed. Although it\\'s not explained in the manual there is a little screw in the box. This screw goes into the side of the heater where it connects to the stand. It stops the heater from turning too far up or down. This isn\\'t shown in the picture.  The casing is made of metal and so is the fan and stand. One great thing is that the case is always cool to the touch, even after hours of being on.  Operation: There are two dials, one for the 2 heat settings and fan-only mode, and the other which is a thermostat. The thermostat is a great idea, but unfortunately I had inconsistent results. Using my thermometer I would see how many degrees the temp would fall before it kicked on. Sometimes it would be perfect with only a degree or so before it turned on, and sometimes it takes about 5-6 degrees before it starts. A bit too much sometimes. I took one star off for this.  It has a light that comes on when the heater is plugged in, regardless of whether it is turned on. It also has a a caution light that comes on when it overheats maybe? This is not explained in the manual, but it has come on for me, oddly enough only when I turn the heater to fan mode and rarely at that.  This heater is not silent. You can easily hear it through walls and doors.  Overall I like this heater. It\\'s small, and easily portable. It heats and maintains a mid-sized, insulated room pretty easily  The reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because of the thermostat issue and that I like my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Optimus-H-5210-Infrared-Quartz-Radiant-Heater/dp/B000GG8DWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Optimus H-5210 Infrared Quartz Radiant Heater</a>&nbsp;so much. It\\'s only $20 right now. It warms your body instantly instead of waiting for the air to warm, doesn\\'t dry the air out, and it\\'s silent.',\n",
       " 'I was on the search for another Worker Placement game and narrowed it down to this.  As usual, I played a practice game by myself to get a feel for the rules and help with teaching the game later. I wasn\\'t too sure if my game group would like the game after doing this because I got this sort of  \"meh\" feeling. I liked the army mechanic within the game, but the rest failed to excite me. This extra board game sense I have aquired over the years could not be any more wrong.  Then came the normal mental battles of anybody who has played a good worker placement game. Frustration of being blocked out of spaces, decisions of what is more important getting the card that gives me a scroll each round or army to get cards with more points or geez I could use some more coin... Players strategically placing their numbered meeples to block others from using certain actions was cutthroat, but no less than we have played in games like Stone Age.  The unique (to us) Army mechanic was definitely the best part of the game to me and also a viable way to victory. A player only went for military and won a game. Another had a good mix of military and empire points also won a game and yet another focused only on their empire also did very well. I also thought the army mechanic rules were going to be tough to follow, but an explanation that worked well was: You can\\'t retire an army that is off fighting for you and they are too tired to fight again if they already battled something this round.  Other Pros: It was easy to teach with very little fiddly rules. Scoring was also very easy to understand, the board was beautiful and yet not complicated to look at. Cards are delightful to look at and easy to understand the icons. Usually our run time limit for a game is 90minutes, each 4 player game we played took a little over an hour...perfect. The order in which things happen each round is simple to follow and there isn\\'t an overwhelming amount of choices, but just enough.  The only cons I could see were were fairly minor. The cards are flimsy and I would have liked better quality material used. I found it odd that a coin is used as the round marker. Couldn\\'t one of those coins on the punch sheet been designed as something different to look at for a round marker? Another player picked it up asking whose coin it was and realized right away after she did it that it was the round marker. The Empire cards seemed a bit off balance. I could care less about using the \"I can place a meeple on the Get Another Meeple Space even if somebody else is there\", but I needed the card to be able to add more to my empire. Whereas the next card power flipped was so much more universally useful to all players. Some kind of secret points would have been nice too. I found myself looking over at other players and adding up their points in my head during the game. Other than storing cards, not much of anything secret going on.  Overall, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun medium weight worker placement game.',\n",
       " \"My first mSR was an experience in frustration. It flew erratically, hovered poorly and darted backwards at incredible speed. Trimming it out was impossible even though the dual rate was set at beginner; anyone in the room with it was at risk. The mSR made a screeching growl as it flew and needed full forward trim with the forward control pressed to its limit in order to launch. The reviews and my experience didn't match up so after a few weeks of trying to get used to the controls it was returned. The replacement was very different. It hovered right out of the box, requiring very little trimming. Considering its feather weight it moved around with good control. It is much quieter than its replacement and can be landed consistently on a snack tray. I can now give a good review on this popular single rotor micro.  I have several coaxial toy helicopters and as reported, is quite different other than the basics. Coaxials are so stable in comparison that learning to fly the micro Blade is a bit like starting over. Simply put, imagine a pingpong ball atop a wave. The mSR is so light that it follows its own turbulence. Take your hands from the controls and if there are no objects in the radius of the washing effect the mSR will settle into a reasonably stationary hover. When maneuvering, sliding left/right or backwards produces very quick movement, even in the low rate setting. Forward locomotion is very similar to the coaxial counterpart if not slower. In other words, the mSR in the low rate is still quite quick and nimble and if not prepared, will get into trouble in all directions but forward. What is perhaps the least desirable aspect of the mSR is the way it launches. Unlike a coaxial, it will not rise straight up. Invariably, it moves a distance left or right. My guess is that it again is being buffeted by its own turbulence. The heavier coaxials with counter rotating blades that act as stabilizing gyros and the overall weight produces mass to overcome this. Perhaps that is the reason the demos show the mSR being launched by hand. You need to forget how easy the coaxial helicopters are to fly and resolve to deal with a new learning curve if you are to enjoy this little humming bird.  I have experienced the beginnings of coordinating a sideways slide with a turn to produce a nose down pitch and turn pirouette style maneuver. This is completely different from any coaxial capability and of course very rewarding and addictive. This I suppose is the definition of the 3D maneuvering capabilities and what draws someone into the more expensive 3 dimensional helicopters. At any rate, this is what has happened to me. My five star rating ignores the relative crudeness and focuses on the value and gratitude to E-flite for offering such an affordable, effective and durable product for the transition. The mSR endures crashes simply because it weighs next to nothing. It is like crashing a feather. Had I rated the mSR on my first experience it would be one or at best two stars. I was unlucky to have gotten a faulty first unit. Now I'm a die hard fan. The simple MLP4DSM control is an excellent value and can be used on their other Bind N Fly helicopters. My eye is now on the 120 SR; a heavier / larger helicopter that can be flown inside and out and has all the same function of its little sibling.  The fit and form of the mSR isn't impressive because it is all business and ignores the coaxial bling race. It has one blue LED to let you know it is active. The canopy is at minimal thickness held on with friction fasteners all made for lightness. Removing and installing the battery each time you fly isn't convenient but once again is simple practicality. The overriding aspect is that every part for the mSR can be purchased, even the screws. It has a large stable following and is THE step one can affordably take from the toy helicopter society into the 3D RC helicopter hobby. It departs radically from the stable flight characteristics of the coaxial (other than hovering) but supplants that change with very rewarding maneuvering capabilities. It is only natural to initially fly the mSR like a coaxial. The result is to complain about the inherent instability during maneuvers but once the controls become extensions of your nervous system, the bird flies from brain waves. What started out as a disappointment has turned into an addiction.\",\n",
       " \"I've had Red Faction: Guerrilla (RFG) on my wish list for several months now.  It looked different than most games I play, so I decided to experiment and give it a try.  Before buying, there was the pesky matter of deciding whether to get the XBOX 360 or Windows version.  I have a fairly high end pc (Win7 64bit, i7 920@ 3.5Ghz, GTX 295 video card), so I decided to enjoy all the eye candy I could with the game.  The reviews are less than stellar for the Windows version (some mention failures to run on Win7), but I'm not scared by such talk.  I was talked into the XBOX version of GTAIV and regretted it after seeing it on Windows.  Installation was pretty straight forward and took 10 or so minutes to finish.  Upon completion of the main installation, it wanted me to install a chat client for gaming.  I went ahead and installed it since I planned to try out the multi-player features of RFG.  I haven't tried the multi-player portion yet, so I'm not sure if it is needed or not.  This was followed up my the game asking me to enter the serial number for activation (yeah, DRM stuff, but I don't care).  I entered the serial and fired up the game.  RFG uses Games for Windows Live, which is fine by me since I like trying to get the max amount of achievements I can.  I also don't mind being connected to the internet all the time because I'm not some crazy conspiracy theorist that is so paranoid of the internet that I physically unplug my cable modem when I'm not using it.  I already have GFWL installed, so I was all set there.  I fired up the game and GFWL also asked me to enter the serial number. GFWL found the latest update (from early April) and asked if I wanted to download and install it.  I accepted and closed RFG while it was downloading and installing the update.  Upon restarting of the game, I was able to start a new career and get going right away.  What ever problems they had before this patch in regards to Windows 7 64bit have been fixed.  I haven't had a single crash after 26 hrs of game play.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward and if you've played any GTA titles you will feel right at home.  Basically, you're job is to avenge your brother's death by killing all the EDF you can to liberate Mars.  This involves blowing things up, which is cool.  The perspective is in the 3rd person, which some folks don't like very much.  Control can be a little annoying when using a keyboard and mouse, so I just use my Xbox controller with this game.  So much like GTA, you have a few different styles of missions to complete.  You have primary missions, guerrilla actions (free hostages, defend site, attack site, carnage), transporter (steal vehicle and deliver to a safe house) challenges, and demolition master challenges to complete.  This gives you a nice variety of stuff to do while trucking through the campaign. The one major complaint I have about the game is there should be more walkers lying around to hijack.  They are a blast to use during assaults since you can flip cars like nothing and watch them start chain reaction explosions that send enemies and debris flying all over the place.  RFG uses the HAVOK physics engine and the GEOMOD 2 destructible environment graphics engine.  This combination results in a pretty intense and surreal experience when blowing everything up that you can get a demolition charge on.  The graphics are actually quite good...for it being on Mars.  There aren't trees everywhere, so the main eye candy in the game are the vehicles and explosions.  The vehicles are highly detailed and animated (especially the walkers).  Driving physics is very complicated and often frustrating due to the fact you can't steer when you're front tires are off the ground (duh).  Realism is where the Windows version shines.  It's very clear when watching videos from the PS3 version that they had to dummy down the physics for those ports.  The transporter help videos showed the vehicles not really bouncing around in response to the terrain.  It was very difficult to beat the Pro times for the achievements on transporter and demolition master challenges.  The downside to this technology is it clearly needs a near top of the line PC to run at near 60 frames per second.  My PC was a perfect match for this game, providing consistent 55-60 fps throughout game play.  One feature I thought was cheesy was the low quality cut screen and mission briefing videos.  These looked like they came from a computer game from 1998.  Overall, I was very happy with RFG.  It is probably one of the most addicting games I've every played.  It can be very repetitive, but what game isn't?  If you like blowing stuff up, then you won't be disappointed with Red Faction: Guerilla.\",\n",
       " \"Controller works fantastically. While the joystick placement may seem a bit off at first, I've grown quite accustomed to them and actually like the design.  The controller is very light, and gets an insane amount of battery life. Hooked up to my PC via a bluetooth adapter I'm ranging anywhere from 40-50 hours on a single charge cycle, which is absolutely amazing. Make sure to use the Toshiba bluetooth stack.  The controller I purchased here is absolutely authentic, and simply the Japanese release of the controller. After viewing youtube and japanese search engines I'm content to say that this is the real deal and not a counterfeit.  Also, one of the most important things for me as someone who plays 2d platformers is the d-pad. The d-pad here is excellent, and very faithful to classic Nintendo fashion.  Easily one of the better wireless controllers on the market. I almost forgot to mention: The triggers here are digital, and not analog. I've grown absolutely frustrated with analog triggers due to their uselessness outside of racing games. Nintendo doesn't include them, and it makes the controller that much better - The triggers here do what I want, which is a quick, simple command engagement. I wish other companies would do this, or at least make it an option when purchasing additional controllers. I am not alone in wanting digital triggers - In most games analog triggers simply seem to get in the way more than anything else.\",\n",
       " \"Amazon has this listed as a game instead of an accessory, and that's a shame since it is a great accessory.  I tried a couple of the cheaper screen protectors you can pick up anywhere, and they all left much to be desired. I came across a review for one of these and it looked better than the others so I ordered one. I'm glad I did. The Hori filter is easily the best one I have ever seen.  It is thicker than other brands, which makes it much easier to apply cleanly. With some of the others it is just about impossible to get it on there cleanly and one particle of dust makes a rather large bubble under the filter. The Hori filter is thick enough to re-apply more than once so if a mote of dust gets in there you can peel it back and use a bit of tape to pull the dust off. You can then press the filter back down with no problems. I wouldn't recommend trying the tape trick on those cheaper and thinner screen protectors. You will mangle them.  Also, since the Hori screen filter is thicker, it protects better. If you get it on there right after getting a PSP, it will remain scratch free indefinitely. I have used three of these so far. Not because they needed to be replaced, but because I put a new silver faceplate on my first PSP, and then later I got a Ceramic White PSP. In both cases, I made sure I had a Hori filter ready to go. When I get one of those gold PSPs I will make sure I have another one ready to install.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this as a child-friendly answer to the wii fit. My kids are younger and had a difficult time with the Wii fit because they weigh so little.  This is much easier for them to use and the games are fun, but the mat is frustrating. It may be easier with older kids (mine are preschool age). The main problem is that you can select items in the navigation with the wii remote, or the mat. Well when a young child finished an exciting game where they are doing a lot of jumping, they continue jumping. So the selection on the menu would change, or the kids would accidentally jump on the '+' on the mat, accepting the choice on the screen.  This also happened during the course of the games. The kids got so excited they couldn't run in place, and would step forward on the controller buttons and pause the game.  Being able to stay on the correct spots is a big issue. The kids look at the screen, not at the floor, so it is very easy for them to move from the correct space, especially in games that require jumping.  There are a few advantages over the Wii Fit (although I still wouldn't trade mine for the world!). This mat works well with smaller children because it registers their weight better. It also allows you to specify if the player is an adult or child. And, it is much easier to go back to the beginning to switch players. And there are many two player games, both competitive and teamwork games. Most Wii Fit games are one player.\",\n",
       " \"A very nicely balanced game which goes beyond the previous titles by adding elements that add interesting diversity in game play.  The previous titles had such incredibly rendered versions of historical cities and even opportunities for a bit of education while you play. And while I did enjoy playing them for a time, they got a bit (dare I say it) boring over time. While initially interesting, the missions became too similar. And no matter how historically accurate and interesting the building, climbing up my 30th ancient edifice only to dive into yet another cart of hay from an improbable height and after assassinating my 99th bad guy from the safety of said concealment, I wanted to move on.  Black Flag adds a lot of interesting elements that eliminate the boredom factor. Sailing around the world engaging in naval battles is an entirely new and welcome addition. And if and when this ever becomes a bit dull, there are plenty of cities, towns and jungle settings to explore and, yep, people to assassinate. Combat is much improved as well. While I really enjoy the stealth aspect of the game, it's nice to occasionally attack adversaries head on. In previous games you'd quickly become overwhelmed with more than a few and combat was a bit difficult to master. This game stays true to its swashbuckling pirate nature by allowing you to run into a hoard of enemy sailors and hold your own while waiting for the rest of your crew to come to your aid. But you will become overwhelmed eventually (as you should) but you can choose stealth or a more direct assault as it fits the situation. In addition, there are other entirely new aspects to the game like crafting that actually means something, hunting, and underwater expeditions. And the ocean feels alive! The occasional storm pops up along with devastating water spouts (which incidentally scare the bejeesus out of me :) and tsunamis which are pretty frightening themselves. And the story itself is entertaining and actually seems to go somewhere.  There are a few minuses that don't detract significantly from the game - Examples include the inevitable stalk / listen in on a conversation missions (annoying as all heck) and those times when you get pulled out of the animus back into the real world for a tack-on story that you're absolutely not interested in. (Is it just me that would rather stay in the assassin world and never go back to the real world? Is the entire idea of the animus kind of a pointless complexity? Yeah, maybe it's just me.) Fortunately, though, you do get to stay within the story for the vast majority of the time in this one.  Overall, great addition to the franchise and a huge step forward.\",\n",
       " \"Okay so honeslty I have not had this for very long and I am already in love with it. This is my first experience with a mechanical keyboard other than messing ones on display in stores and after messing with the keys on a display model I decided to buy this and I am very happy with my decision. First off I am used to the plain old $25 membrane keyboard that you can go pick up at Walmart and use with ease but after using this, it will be hard to go back. Yes it is that good.  Pros: For the pros I am looking at the over all performance of the keyboard and aesthetics. I like how the keys feel when pressed. Again since I am used to membrane it I used to mashing the keys all the way to the bottom but with this I do not have to as I hear a pleasing click with each key press(my sister says it sounds smarter an more professional). Next is the LED's. I have read a lot of reviews that say the LED's can go bad and I hope that does not happen but form what I am seeing they are phenomenal and I love how I can change the brightness and the gaming setting that only lights up numbers 1-6 and the WASD keys. Since I am a gamer that is very helpful. The next thing on my list of pro's are the multimedia function keys, they are better than my previous keyboard that even though it did have them, they were nowhere near as decent feeling as these. Now onto the construction of the board. It is made from aluminum and weighs slightly less than my laptop (6.1 lbs). It feels very sturdy unlike a Razer keyboard I used to own and the added palm rest is very natural feeling and comfortable.  Cons: Honestly I can't think of any at the moment, Corsair is a such a trustworthy brand that I trust it will have very few issues.  Other: A few things that should be noted about this product are as follows: The palm rest while comfortable, is made of plastic. It feels very durable but other than that I am not sure about how long it will last but I will update this review if and when needed. The next thing to be aware of is the USB dongle that powers it. Unlike most keyboards that I am familiar with this one needs two USB ports to operate it, not one. So be prepared to give up an extra port for an awesome product.  With this I leave the rest up to the purchasers who might read this review and the countless others and decide on their own which keyboard to buy(this one). I will recommend this to any professional writer or anyone that games.\"]"
