It was a gift for my sister who never opened the box.  The next summer during a heat wave I asked for my unused gift back, ha!, and was in heaven for a few months.  the next summer after a few weeks the unit gave out.called new air and it was over the one year mark so no warranty.  so my advice is do not buy without  extended warranty!\n",
       "9    Be careful, NewAir will not stand by their products. Our NewAir broke within the first 4 hours of use.  The manufacturer will NOT cover the item under warranty. Just in case you're actually thinking of buying a NewAir product... think twice...\\n\\nFrom: NewAir Sales <sales@newair.com>\\nDate: Fri, Nov 14, 2014 at 11:03 AM\\nSubject: Re: Icemaker return\\nTo: Susan Ferguson <xxxxx@gwmail.gwu.edu>\\n\\nHi Susan,\\n\\nThe manufacturer warranty is void if the unit is purchased by a private seller who does not have our consent to sell our products. This is the same reason why we ask for a copy of your receipt upon requesting warranty claims because if it not from a valid authorized dealer we will not proceed with warranty work. We also list our authorized dealers on our web site for customer use. We stand behind our products, however when an item is purchased from a private seller the purchaser runs the risk of the item being used, open box, refurbished, and or a scratch and dent. Our one year limited manufacturer's warranty is only valid on new items sold by our authorized online dealers. It is unfortunate to see that you are in this situation, however you will need to contact the seller of the item for a replacement or refund.\\n\\nHave a great day!\\n\\nMireya\\nCustomer Support\\nNewAir | 3419 East Chapman Ave. #190 | Orange, CA 92869\\nPh: 855-963-9247 Em: sales@newair.com\\nFB: facebook.com/NewAirUSA Twitter: @NewAirUSA\\nPinterest: pinterest.com/NewAirUSA Instagram: NewAirUSA\\nWeb: [...]\\n\"Made by awesome\"\\n\\nOn Thu, Nov 13, 2014 at 7:59 PM, Susan Ferguson <xxxxx@gwmail.gwu.edu> wrote:\\nHello Mireya-\\n\\nI'm sorry but I thought the manufacturer warranty was for the manufacturer, NewAir.  Please explain why the warranty is not valid in this case.  I don't see anywhere in the warranty exclusions that the warranty is not valid if not purchased from an authorized dealer.  In addition, a consumer would never know who \"authorized dealers\" are because if a company is selling your product doesn't that implicitly make them authorized to do so?\\n\\nI sincerely hope that NewAir will reconsider this position and stand by the integrity of their products.  This ice machine was literally used for four hours before failing and it is, quite frankly egregious that your company is negating a warranty that explicitly states it will repair or replace defective materials or workmanship for up to one year.\\n\\nPlease let me know how I can talk to a dispute department regarding this matter.  I look forward to your response and I will refrain from giving any reviews of your product until this matter is resolved.\\n\\nThank you,\\nSusan Ferguson\\n\\nOn Thu, Nov 13, 2014 at 3:10 PM, NewAir Sales <sales@newair.com> wrote:\\nHi Susan,\\n\\nUnfortunately, the ice maker was not purchased from an authorized dealer.

I used it one time and within 4 hours the cooling unit had shut down.  My best estimate is that the pump was still working (the water was getting pumped through) but the cooling mechanism was not.  When I plugged the unit back in to try it a few hours later, the cooling mechanism never turned on.\\n\\nSince this product is still under warranty, I am hoping to acquire a new unit since this particular one has essentially never been used and is obviously faulty in some capacity.\\n\\nI have attached the receipt for your reference.  It was purchased as a gift through Amazon Marketplace.  Thanks so much and I look forward to your response.\\n\\nSusan Ferguson\n",

It was a gift for my sister who never opened the box.  The next summer during a heat wave I asked for my unused gift back, ha!, and was in heaven for a few months.  the next summer after a few weeks the unit gave out.called new air and it was over the one year mark so no warranty.  so my advice is do not buy without  extended warranty!\n",
       "9    Be careful, NewAir will not stand by their products. Our NewAir broke within the first 4 hours of use.  The manufacturer will NOT cover the item under warranty. Just in case you're actually thinking of buying a NewAir product... think twice...  From: NewAir Sales <sales@newair.com> Date: Fri, Nov 14, 2014 at 11:03 AM Subject: Re: Icemaker return To: Susan Ferguson <xxxxx@gwmail.gwu.edu>  Hi Susan,  The manufacturer warranty is void if the unit is purchased by a private seller who does not have our consent to sell our products. This is the same reason why we ask for a copy of your receipt upon requesting warranty claims because if it not from a valid authorized dealer we will not proceed with warranty work. We also list our authorized dealers on our web site for customer use. We stand behind our products, however when an item is purchased from a private seller the purchaser runs the risk of the item being used, open box, refurbished, and or a scratch and dent. Our one year limited manufacturer's warranty is only valid on new items sold by our authorized online dealers. It is unfortunate to see that you are in this situation, however you will need to contact the seller of the item for a replacement or refund.  Have a great day!

Please explain why the warranty is not valid in this case.  I don't see anywhere in the warranty exclusions that the warranty is not valid if not purchased from an authorized dealer.  In addition, a consumer would never know who \"authorized dealers\" are because if a company is selling your product doesn't that implicitly make them authorized to do so?  I sincerely hope that NewAir will reconsider this position and stand by the integrity of their products.  This ice machine was literally used for four hours before failing and it is, quite frankly egregious that your company is negating a warranty that explicitly states it will repair or replace defective materials or workmanship for up to one year.  Please let me know how I can talk to a dispute department regarding this matter.  I look forward to your response and I will refrain from giving any reviews of your product until this matter is resolved.

You will need to contact the seller \"Mehadrin\" through Amazon for any existing issues on your unit.  Have a great day!

I used it one time and within 4 hours the cooling unit had shut down.  My best estimate is that the pump was still working (the water was getting pumped through) but the cooling mechanism was not.  When I plugged the unit back in to try it a few hours later, the cooling mechanism never turned on.  Since this product is still under warranty, I am hoping to acquire a new unit since this particular one has essentially never been used and is obviously faulty in some capacity.  I have attached the receipt for your reference.  It was purchased as a gift through Amazon Marketplace.  Thanks so much and I look forward to your response.  Susan Ferguson\n",
